CELEBRATING BRAD JACKSONS RECORD OF PUBLIC SERVICE TO KOSCIUSKO COUNTY
I rise to honor, recognize, and congratulate 
my good friend, business leader and builder, devoted public servant, 
and Kosciusko County Commissioner Brad Jackson as he prepares to retire 
as County Commissioner at the end of this year after 28 years in 
elected office.
  Brad has been a close personal friend of mine for more than a decade 
and a committed and effective champion for all things Kosciusko County 
for even longer. From his work as a second-generation homebuilder and 
experienced business owner to his service in elected office, Brads 
long-standing commitment to meeting the needs of Kosciusko County 
Hoosiers has been deep and unwavering. Quite simply, Brad is the kind 
of person that you want in your corner and serving in government and 
making decisions that affect peoples lives.
  Brads belief in and adherence to conservative principles and values 
has helped keep Kosciusko County growing and on the move during Brads 
nearly three-decade tenure as County Commissioner. Fiscal discipline, 
low taxes, preventing unnecessary regulations on businesses and job 
creators, and support for law enforcement and keeping crime low have 
all been hallmarks of Brads approach to politics and public service. 
Most of all, his love for community, his family, and God has kept Brad 
grounded in the things that matter, and it has made him a leader who is 
admired and respected by so many.
  As Brads career in public life comes to a close, I am reminded of 
the saying ``I like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives. 
I like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him. I 
believe this quote applies uniquely well to County Commissioner Brad 
Jackson. The Kosciusko County community is unquestionably better off 
thanks to this good man with a servants heart. Brad has not only built 
countless construction projects in his career, he has also built an 
incredible legacy and a stronger foundation for Kosciusko County to 
stand and grow upon going forward.
  I join Hoosiers throughout Indianas Second Congressional District in 
expressing our gratitude to Brad for his many years of dedicated 
service. I wish Brad a very happy retirement and him, his wife 
Lynnette, their two sons, and their extended family all the very best 
going forward.
COMMEMORATING THE SMITH COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY ALLIANCES 90TH 
                                of texas
I rise today to commemorate and celebrate the 
90th anniversary of the Smith County Medical Society Alliance, an 
organization that has strengthened, supported, and served medical 
families in and around Tyler, Texas, since 1934. Their dedication to 
nurturing and encouraging a healthy community has not been overlooked.
  Over the years, the SCMS Alliance has provided countless educational 
and supportive opportunities, events, and projects for the citizens of 
Smith County.
  The SCMS Alliance has distributed over $1 million in medical student 
scholarships to students at Tyler Junior College, the University of 
Texas at Tyler, and UT Tyler School of Medicine. Their Junior Health 
Ambassadors project focuses on providing physician children with ways 
they can serve Smith County. The Youth Leadership Council aims to 
develop leadership skills among local high school students. The SCMS 
Alliance has also collaborated with TMAA to sponsor book vending 
machines at elementary schools.
  Members of the SCMS Alliance are primarily spouses of active and 
retired physicians, as well as physicians themselves. Physicians and 
their spouses make significant sacrifices to serve and care for others, 
and it is a privilege to honor their selflessness. These members use 
their time impactfully to serve Smith County, offering their support to 
doctors and doctors families. And for that, I am once again proud to 
be an East Texan, where people put others before themselves.
  I would like to thank President Renee Wright, the SCMS Alliance 
Board, and all the members of the Smith County Medical Society Alliance 
for their outstanding work over the years. I am delighted to 
congratulate the Alliance on 90 years of service to Smith County.
along with the people of St. Louis, I rise 
today to honor and recognize the esteemed Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, 
Inc., particularly the members of the St. Louis Alumnae Chapter and the 
Saint Louis Metropolitan Alumnae Chapter, on the occasion of Delta Day, 
celebrated on October 18, 2024, in the City of St. Louis.
  Founded in 1913 at Howard University by 22 courageous collegiate 
women, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. has been a beacon of social 
justice, leadership, and public service. The Founders first public 
act--marching alongside the suffragettes to achieve voting rights for 
women--set the tone for more than a century of advocacy and action. 
Today, the sorority continues to be a transformative force in 
communities across the globe, guided by the powerful theme: Forward 
With Fortitude: Engaging Our Sisterhood, Empowering Our Communities, 
Elevating Our Impact.
  The St. Louis Alumnae Chapter and Saint Louis Metropolitan Alumnae 
Chapter have proudly embodied the sororitys mission of service and 
advocacy in our region. Their dedication to public service has improved 
countless lives in St. Louis, as they have stood in the vanguard of 
social, educational, and economic justice. Whether it is through 
mentorship programs, voter engagement initiatives, or charitable 
efforts, Deltas are at the heart of helping to make our communities 
stronger.
  On this Delta Day, we recognize our remarkable Deltas for their 
tireless efforts and lasting contributions. As they gather together, we 
honor their ongoing work to safeguard the legacy of those who came 
before them and to build a better future for those who will follow.
  On behalf of Missouris First District, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. and 
in recognition of October 18, 2024, as Delta Day in the City of St. 
Louis. May we continue to support and uplift each and every member and 
the communities they so passionately serve.
I rise today to honor and celebrate Mr. 
David Jakubaszek. It is with deepest respect and heartfelt remembrance 
that we recognize Mr. Jakubaszek for posthumously receiving the 
Outstanding Service Award by the Chamber of Commerce of the Tonawandas.
, where 
he grew up and cultivated a love for his community that would guide him 
throughout his life. After pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business 
Administration in Pennsylvania, he was commissioned into the U.S. 
Army--a testament to his commitment to service. It was during this time 
that he met the love of his life, Jean, and together they built a 
family that included their four cherished children: Jennifer, Michael, 
Thomas, and Joseph.
38 years of service as the 
Accountant of the City of North Tonawanda, a trustee of the public 
library, an usher at the Riviera Theater and other various leadership 
roles throughout the community.
  David Jakubaszeks legacy is not just in the positions he held or the 
time he volunteered, but in the countless lives he touched with his 
kindness, generosity, and unwavering support. He embodied the spirit of 
community, showing us all what it means to give of oneself for the 
betterment of others. His love for life and his dedication to service 
will forever be an inspiration to us all.
, as we honor David Jakubaszek today, let us remember him 
not only for his outstanding service, but also for the values he 
instilled in each of us--values of compassion, dedication, and the 
importance of lifting one another up. While he may no longer be with us 
in body, his spirit lives on in the community he cherished so deeply.
I rise today to honor the life of Mary 
``Marie Fitzgerald of Norwich, Connecticut. Mary passed away 
peacefully on October 5, 2024, at the age of 99. As a lifelong resident 
of Union Street, she was a pillar of the Norwich community, touching 
countless lives in her almost half-century of service as a teacher.
  Mary was born on December 14, 1924, in Norwich, Connecticut, to 
William and Kathryn Fitzgerald. Her father was an amazing person, whose 
legacy of public service lives on at the local, state, and federal 
levels. He grew up in a first-generation Irish American family, went to 
work in a foundry at the age of 15, and because of his work ethic, 
became a foreman, was elected Mayor of Norwich, and in 1936, Member of 
the U.S. House of Representatives. As a freshman member of Congress, he 
succeeded in passing the National Apprenticeship Authorization Act--
``The Fitzgerald Act which set national standards for apprenticeship 
training that still is the law of the land. He returned to Connecticut 
and served in WWII on the Connecticut War Production Board, which 
produced military equipment (submarines, aircraft engines) that was 
instrumental to the success of the allied nations. As his daughter, 
Mary grew up close to all the action of such a dynamic leader.
  After her family returned to Norwich from Washington, Mary too chose 
a path of public service, albeit in a different form.
  After completing her education, Mary dedicated her life to early 
childhood education and the profession of teaching. For many decades, 
she worked as a kindergarten teacher, helping to shape the minds of 
generations of children. Mary led with compassion and went above and 
beyond to create a caring and supportive environment for each student 
who entered her classroom. She helped instill a love of learning for an 
incredible number of students who will not soon forget her impact.
  Mary loved her neighborhood and the people around her. Outside of her 
work as a teacher, she thoughtfully devoted her time to charities 
throughout the community as well as her church. Mary also served as a 
devoted Parishioner of the Cathedral of St. Patrick, attending mass 
every day and attending virtually when she could no longer attend in 
person. She was also a member of the Rosary Altar Society and the 
Connecticut Alpha Delta Kappa Chapter, a fraternal organization for 
teachers.
  In her free time, Mary was adventurous and loved to have new 
experiences. Starting in 1969, she traveled with her best friend 
Phyllis. Together, they saw several countries and six different 
continents, finding favorites in Ireland, Japan, Bermuda, and New 
Zealand.
, I am honored to represent constituents like Mary. Her 
friends and family remarked that Mary had an infectious love for life 
and emulated devotion to her community. She was a beloved teacher and 
community leader, and we can take solace in the knowledge that she has 
left a legacy through each and every one of her students and the 
countless individuals who knew her. She is survived by generations of 
cousins including Mary ``Betsy Clarke, Heather Anderson, and Adam 
Clarke and their respective families. Mary is also survived by her 
neighbor, David Bonneville. I request that my colleagues honor Marys 
life of service.
today I recognize the Republic Day of 
Kazakhstan, commemorating Kazakhstans declaration of sovereignty on 
October 25, 1990. This pivotal moment paved the way for Kazakhstans 
eventual independence from the Soviet Union and symbolizes the nations 
enduring commitment to self-determination, prosperity, and peace.
  Kazakhstans early alignment with the West has significantly 
influenced its development. Over the past three decades, Kazakhstan has 
transformed into a thriving nation with a strong economy, a growing 
international presence, and a robust partnership with the United 
States.
  The relationship between Kazakhstan and the United States is rooted 
in the shared values of democracy, economic growth, and mutual respect. 
As we celebrate Kazakhstans achievements, we reaffirm our commitment 
to working together in addressing global challenges and promoting 
peace, security, and economic development.
  Kazakhstan continues to be a pillar of stability in Central Asia, 
emerging as a global leader in nuclear nonproliferation, peacekeeping, 
and fostering regional cooperation. As a net contributor to peace and 
security not only in the region, but also globally, Kazakhstan is 
committed to addressing global challenges and promoting international 
stability.
  As a religiously diverse country, it serves as a case study of 
peaceful coexistence. Kazakhstan hosts the Congress of Leaders of World 
and Traditional Religions, which has become an important venue for 
fostering dialogue among various faiths and serves as a unique platform 
for interfaith and intercultural cooperation. At a tumultuous time in 
the world, this event serves as an important opportunity for faith 
leaders to work to promote and protect freedom of religious expression 
and worship in Kazakhstan and in all nations.
  President Kassym-Jomart Tokayevs commitment to political and 
societal reforms is commendable. Despite external pressures, Kazakhstan 
has remained a peaceful and stabilizing force in Central Asia, 
exemplifying its dedication to democracy and Western ideals.
  Kazakhstan remains a reliable and trusted partner of the United 
States, particularly as an active member of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). This long-standing partnership highlights the 
importance of advancing efforts to establish Permanent Normal Trade 
Relations (PNTR), ensuring that Kazakhstans economic growth is fully 
acknowledged and supported within the global marketplace.
  As we look to the future, the United States and Kazakhstan are poised 
to deepen their partnership through continued dialogue, trade, and 
collaboration on shared goals. Together, we are committed to fostering 
peace, security, and prosperity, not only in Central Asia but on the 
global stage.
I rise today to recognize and honor 
two exceptional officers from the Vidor Police Department, Officer 
Michael Stephenson and Officer Ashton Moss, for their courageous, life-
saving actions in the face of a familys worst nightmare. Their swift 
and selfless response is a shining example of the best that law 
enforcement has to offer--timely heroics in the service of others.
  In the early hours of Tuesday, September 10, 2024, at 1:49 AM, the 
Vidor Police Dispatch Center received a call about a residential fire 
with reports of children trapped inside. When Officers Stephenson and 
Moss arrived on the scene, they wasted no time. Spotting an air 
conditioning unit in the window of the childrens room, they 
immediately began working to dislodge it, knowing every second counted.
  Officer Stephenson managed to remove the window unit, and with the 
help of Officer

Moss, they reached inside and pulled out two young children--a 7-year-
old and a 9-year-old. Just moments after they rescued those precious 
kids, flames erupted from the window.
  I thank Officers Michael Stephenson and Ashton Moss, for their 
bravery, speed, and dedication. Their actions embody the true spirit of 
Southeast Texas--courage, selflessness, and a deep commitment to 
protecting others. It is an honor to represent them in Congress, and 
their heroism sets an example for us all.

                                 SCORE
I rise today to recognize the 
outstanding academic accomplishments of a constituent from my district, 
Hayden Joseph Kang.
  Hayden is a Senior at Council Rock High School South who regularly 
demonstrates a commitment to academic excellence, with this dedication 
culminating in him achieving a perfect score of 1600 on the Scholastic

  Haydens performance on the SAT should serve as a testament to his 
intelligence and motivation. I am encouraged by his motivation to 
perform incredibly in his academic career, and I am proud to represent 
such a remarkable student in my district.
  It is my hope that, by Haydens example, students throughout my 
district and throughout the country are encouraged to challenge 
themselves academically, and endeavor to strive for excellence in every 
facet of their lives. Moreover, the example provided by young people, 
like Hayden, should serve as an inspiration to challenge ourselves and 
strive for excellence in every facet of our lives.
  I would like to wish Hayden the best in his future endeavors, both 
academically and professionally, and once again congratulate him on his 
incredible performance on the SAT.
I rise today to honor Metra Commuter 
Railroad on its 40th anniversary of providing reliable, affordable, and 
safe transportation services throughout the state and for residents of 
Illinois 6th Congressional District.
  In the last forty years, Metra has made significant progress 
revitalizing and rebuilding stations, tracks, and signals, purchasing 
new locomotives and railcars, and modernizing and stabilizing and 
expanding services across the region. Metra also provided a crucial 
lifeline during the global pandemic.
  I commend Metra on these advancements and was proud to lead the 
Illinois Delegations support efforts for its recent Federal Transit 
Administrations Rail Vehicle Replacement Program grant application. 
Metra was selected as one of only three recipients nationwide to 
receive a grant. This $100 million federal investment will support the 
procurement of new, multi-level railcars to replace those from the 
1970s and improve the safety, comfort, and accessibility to all 
passengers boarding Metra trains.
, please join me in paying tribute to the dedicated 
professionals at Metra who have continuously serviced Illinois with 
vital transportation as they celebrate forty years of service. I thank 
Metra Commuter Railroad, and wish them a happy anniversary.
I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
public servant, Chief J. Scott Bendig, on the occasion of his 
retirement from the Montgomery Township Police Department after 35 
years of dedicated service to the Montgomery Township community and the 
field of law enforcement.
  Chief Bendig was born and raised in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. He 
began his journey into public service by graduating from Bishop 
McDevitt High School in 1985. He then pursued higher education, earning 
a Bachelors Degree in Criminal Justice from Temple University followed 
by his completion of the Pennsylvania State Police Academy. Chief 
Bendigs passion for law enforcement was matched by his commitment to 
continuous learning, as evidenced by his earning a Masters Degree in 
Criminal Justice from West Chester University and his graduation from 
the prestigious FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. These 
experiences further solidified his credentials as a leader in public 
safety.
  Chief Bendig dedicated his entire 35-year career in law enforcement 
to the residents of Montgomery Township. During his tenure, he rose 
through the ranks, starting as a Recruit Patrol Officer in 1989 before 
serving as a Canine Officer and Unit Supervisor, Corporal in 2000, 
Sergeant in 2001, and eventually Deputy Chief in 2010. In 2012, he 
became Chief of Police, where he embodied professionalism integrity, 
and a tireless commitment to the safety of the community.
  His auxiliary duties included serving as a DARE Officer, DARE Officer 
in Charge, and Field Training Officer, as well as creating and 
instructing the Citizens Police Academy and teaching at various police 
academies. Chief Bendigs commitment to education extended to the 
classroom. He worked as an Adjunct Faculty member at Gwynedd Mercy 
University, and as a General Instructor for the Municipal Police 
Officer Education and Training Commission for over a decade. These 
teaching roles highlight his dedication to nurturing the next 
generation of law enforcement professionals.
  Under Chief Bendigs leadership, the Montgomery Township Police 
Department experienced significant advancements in both its operational 
capabilities and technology infrastructure. One of his most impactful 
initiatives was the implementation of the Body Worn Camera system, a 
crucial tool for promoting transparency and accountability. He also led 
the deployment of Fixed License Plate Readers, which enhanced the 
departments ability to monitor and respond to criminal activity more 
effectively.
  Chief Bendigs leadership extended far beyond the borders of 
Montgomery Township. He served as Commander of the Montgomery County 
Major Incident Response Team, playing a key role in handling critical 
incidents across the region. He also contributed significantly as the 
. His leadership roles within law 
enforcement associations are equally impressive, having served as 
Executive Chair and President of the Police Chiefs Association of 
Montgomery County and as a member of the National Security Executive 
Board for the FBI Philadelphia Field Division.
  In addition to his leadership in public safety, Chief Bendig was a 
trusted instructor and advisor. He served as a Training Committee Chair 
for the Eastern Pennsylvania FBI National Academy Associates and as a 
peer reviewer for the United States Department of Justices Office of 
Justice Programs. His involvement in the Montgomery County Racial/
Ethnic Disparities Task Force further underscores his commitment to 
fostering fairness and inclusivity in law enforcement.
  Throughout his career, Chief Bendig was recognized with numerous 
awards and commendations. His accolades include two Unit Citations, two 
Commendations for Merit, and a Certificate of Commendation, along with 
countless letters recognizing his commendable service and leadership. 
His influence extended beyond Montgomery Township, as he served as an 
instructor and advisor to various law enforcement organizations 
ensuring his knowledge and experience were shared widely.
  What truly distinguishes Chief Bendig, however, is his sincere 
dedication to the welfare of his officers and the community. He 
fostered a culture of excellence within the department, constantly 
challenging younger officers to strive for their full potential. His 
legacy of leadership is marked by both his technical acumen and his 
unwavering commitment to nurturing the next generation of law 
enforcement professionals.
  I am confident that his impact on Montgomery Township will be felt 
for many years to come. His selfless service, exemplary leadership, and 
lasting contributions will forever be a part of the communitys 
history.
  I extend my deepest gratitude to Chief Bendig for his years of 
devoted service and wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.
I rise today to recognize an 
extraordinary individual from Pennsylvanias First Congressional 
District--

someone who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to 
both our community and our country. It is with great respect and 
admiration that I recognize Amy Keiper-Shaw, one of our districts 
distinguished Hometown Heroes.
  Hometown Heroes are not defined by titles or accolades but by the 
quiet power of their actions. They are distinguished by their 
unwavering integrity, the strength of their character, and their 
steadfast commitment to the people and places they serve. They are the 
foundation upon which our communities stand--the ones who lift others 
up, inspire hope, and, in doing so, call us all to higher standards of 
service and compassion. Amy has embodied this spirit in ways that words 
can scarcely capture.
  A licensed Clinical Social Worker, Certified Grief Counselor, 
Clinical Thanatologist, and Certified Dementia Practitioner, Amy has 
dedicated her life to providing care, comfort, and compassion to others 
in our community in challenging times of need. Throughout her career, 
Amy saw first-hand the heartbreaking suffering of children who lost a 
loved one and recognized a need for a positive, compassionate and 
effective bereavement resource for children and their families in our 
community. And so, in 2013, her non-profit, Hands Holding Hearts, was 
born and has since become a beacon of comfort and hope for Bucks County 
children and families as they navigate some of the most painful and 
difficult times of their lives. Studies show that one in 12 kids will 
lose a parent or sibling by the age of 18, with that rate only 
increasing since the pandemic. Without the necessary support and 
resources to process their grief, children are left without the tools 
and skills needed to successfully and positively move forward. Through 
workshops, Camp Feeling Better Summer Camp, counseling, support groups, 
and community presentations, Amy and her team of experienced counselors 
provide children with vital education and resources for coping and 
communicating and the invaluable comfort of knowing they are not alone.
, it is through the work of people like Amy that our 
communities thrive, and our Nation grows stronger. Her efforts remind 
us of the power in making a positive difference in the lives of 
children and families in need.
  On behalf of Pennsylvanias First Congressional District, I extend my 
deepest gratitude to Amy for her extraordinary service. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional individual, whose 
leadership and spirit of service will inspire generations to come. May 
her example remind us of the boundless potential within each of us to 
make our communities, country, and world a better place.
I rise today to recognize an 
extraordinary individual from Pennsylvanias First Congressional 
District--someone who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in 
service to both our community and our country. It is with great respect 
and admiration that I recognize Valerie Hamilton, one of our districts 
distinguished Hometown Heroes.
  Hometown Heroes are not defined by titles or accolades, but by the 
quiet power of their actions. They are distinguished by their 
unwavering integrity, the strength of their character, and their 
steadfast commitment to the people and places they serve. They are the 
foundation upon which our communities stand--the ones who lift others 
up, inspire hope, and in doing so, call us all to higher standards of 
service and compassion. Valerie Hamilton has embodied this spirit in 
ways that words can scarcely capture.
  Since 2012, Valerie--owner, founder, and executive director of 
Children of God Educational Services--has been a driving force in 
transforming early education and childcare in Bristol Borough. With a 
relentless focus on strengthening family bonds and immersing children 
in rich, local experiences, Valerie has built more than a childcare 
service--she has cultivated a foundation for lifelong success. Every 
day, Valerie and her devoted team go above and beyond to provide 
children with the skills, opportunities, and confidence they need to 
thrive. Through her carefully crafted Preschool, After School, and 
Summer Camp programs, she not only enriches young minds but also offers 
critical support to working parents, empowering families to succeed.
  Valeries mission is rooted in more than education--she shapes 
character, instilling integrity, compassion, and a deep sense of 
community in every child she serves. Her unwavering commitment to high-
quality care and her ability to inspire and uplift have left a lasting 
mark on countless children and families. Her work is not just 
childcare; it is a beacon of hope, opportunity, and purpose, changing 
lives and building a stronger future for our community.
  It is through the work of people like Valerie Hamilton that our 
communities thrive and our Nation grows stronger. Her service, given 
without expectation of recognition, stands as a testament to the belief 
that one individuals dedication can ripple through the lives of many, 
sparking change, fostering resilience, and inspiring hope. Today, we 
honor Valerie Hamilton not just for her remarkable deeds but for who 
she is--a true hero in every sense of the word.
  On behalf of Pennsylvanias First Congressional District, I extend my 
deepest gratitude to Valerie Hamilton for her extraordinary service. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional individual, 
whose leadership

and spirit of service will inspire generations to come. May her example 
remind us of the boundless potential within each of us to make our 
communities, country, and world a better place.
I rise today to honor the extraordinary 
life of Russell Matar, who I named Veteran of the Month for October 
from Michigans 9th Congressional District. Born on October 18, 1924, 
in Port Huron, Michigan, Russell was the second of five children. His 
journey began with resilience and dedication, culminating in his 
graduation from Port Huron High School in 1942, before he enlisted in 
the United States Navy in 1943. His service during World War II took 
him to the

Mojave Desert, where he contributed to vital rocket experiments, and to 
the Marshall Islands, where he repaired aircraft electronics. He was 
honorably discharged in 1946.
  In 1954, Russell married Ginger McDaniel, and together they built a 
loving family, raising two sons and a daughter, along with a growing 
number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
  Russells professional career spanned over three decades with 
Montgomery Ward, where he made significant contributions throughout the 
Midwest. His commitment to community service was unwavering; he 
actively participated in local Chambers of Commerce and Merchants 
Associations. In Flint, Michigan, where he spent his later career, 
Russell left an indelible mark on the community. Notably, he served as 
Chairman of a committee that collaborated with then-Mayor Jim 
Rutherford to plan the inaugural Crim Race in Flint. Additionally, he 
dedicated six years to the Whaley Board for Children and served on the 
board of the YMCA.
  As a devoted member of St. Pauls Episcopal Church in Flint, Russell 
held the position of Vestry member and worked alongside First 
Presbyterian Church and Court Street United Methodist Church to 
establish the Ministry of Crossover Outreach. This initiative addressed 
the needs of the local community by providing clothing, food, and 
referral services.
  Throughout his remarkable century-long life, Russell Matar has 
exemplified the core values of family, community, and service. His 
legacy of steadfast support and commitment to those around him truly 
sets him apart.
  I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating the 
life of Russell Matar, a true pillar of our community and a shining 
testament to the enduring spirit of service.
I rise today to address a critical and growing 
challenge that severely impacts our environment and has widespread 
ripple-effect consequences beyond: invasive species.
  This challenge threatens the delicate balance of our ecosystems, as 
invasive species can outcompete, prey on or introduce diseases to our 
native flora and fauna. The consequences of these disruptions are 
severe, leading to declines in biodiversity, diminishing the resilience 
of our ecosystems in the face of environmental change. These effects in 
turn can cause widespread economic damage; agriculture and forestry 
would be just two examples.
  Hawaii in particular faces unique challenges from invasive species. 
Its isolation has led to the evolution of many endemic species that are 
found nowhere else on Earth. Unfortunately, these native species often 
lack the defenses to compete with or resist the pressures of invasive 
plants and animals, which can rapidly alter ecosystems and displace 
local species. In Hawaii, invasive species have caused significant 
ecological damage, threatening the survival of native birds and plants. 
Protecting Hawaiis unique biodiversity is not just an environmental 
necessity--it is a cultural imperative that reflects the identity and 
heritage of the Hawaiian people.
  Invasive species are not just a localized problem; they pose a 
significant threat to the integrity of our natural world. Addressing 
this crisis requires a coordinated and comprehensive approach, focusing 
on prevention, early detection, and effective management strategies to 
safeguard our vulnerable ecosystems.
  In response to this urgent need, I am jointly introducing the 
Invasive Species Response Act with my colleague, Rep. Jim Moylan of 
Guam. This legislation will codify the existing Invasive Species Strike 
Teams program currently operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
(FWS). These specialized teams play an essential role in managing 
emerging invasive species, employing strategies tailored to local 
conditions across the National Wildlife Refuge System. With 21 teams 
strategically positioned in various FWS regions, they are on the front 
lines, addressing the unique challenges posed by invasive species.
  The Invasive Species Response Act signifies a transformative shift 
within the FWS, moving us from a reactive, species-by-species approach 
to a more strategic, system-wide framework for managing emerging 
invasive species. Key provisions of the bill include formally 
establishing the Invasive Species Strike Teams program, which will 
create a stable and legally supported framework to ensure consistent 
funding and enhance our management efforts. The act also mandates 
enhanced coordination and reporting through integrated systems and 
standardized procedures, ensuring transparency and enabling us to track 
progress with annual reports to Congress and the public. Furthermore, 
it authorizes $15 million annually from Fiscal Year 2025 through 2029, 
aligning with current FWS investment levels to support ongoing 
initiatives.
  This legislation is a crucial step forward in protecting our natural 
resources and enhancing our capacity to respond swiftly to the threats 
posed by invasive species.
  I urge my colleagues to lend their support to our Invasive Species 
Response Act. Together, we can ensure the preservation of our 
ecosystems and promote a resilient future for our environment.
  Mahalo.
