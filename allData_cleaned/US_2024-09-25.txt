I rise to recognize 
Ridgway, Pennsylvanias Bicentennial year.
  In 1817, Philadelphian shipping merchant Jacob Ridgway purchased 
120,000 acres of land in Northwest Pennsylvania.
  Forty thousand of these acres would officially become Elk County on 
April 18, 1843 with Ridgway as the county seat.
  According to historians, the town of Ridgway was established in 1824 
when one of Mr. Ridgways nephews, James Gillis, convinced Ridgway that 
his land, which was filled with an abundance of lumber, could become a 
lucrative business opportunity.
  In the past two hundred years, Ridgway has evolved into a thriving 
community where the lumber industry continues to flourish.
  Ridgway is home to the Ridgway Chainsaw Carving Rendezvous.
  What began as a shared passion of family and friends enthusiastic 
about wood carving has grown into the largest chainsaw carving 
gathering of its kind, attracting visitors from across the globe.
, Ridgway, PA, is home to a vibrant community, and I hope 
you will join me in wishing Ridgway a happy 200th-year celebration.
I rise today to celebrate the remarkable 
and continued leadership and service of Mr. Scott Bieler.
  As the President and CEO of West Herr, Scott leads the largest 
privately-owned automotive group in New York State, and one of the 
biggest in the United States. All told, there are over 3,000 employees 
across 39 locations in Erie, Niagara, Monroe, and Ontario counties, 
with new expansions and locations always on the horizon.
  Scott has continued to go above and beyond, and while he is known as 
generous--few know the extent of his philanthropy throughout the 
community. Scott is actively involved and supports many charitable and 
community initiatives, including the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation, 
Visit Buffalo Niagara, and Daemen University.
  On Thursday, September 26th, Mr. Scott Bieler will be honored at 
Buffalo Niagara Partnerships Second Annual Economic Development 
Summit, where he will receive the 2024 Industry Leader Award. On behalf 
of Western New York, I am proud to congratulate my friend on his many 
accomplishments, and I join him in celebrating this well-deserved

  I therefore ask that this legislative body now join me in celebrating 
, along with his continued dedication to

I congratulate City of Hopes National 
Medical Center in Duarte, California on being recognized as one of the 
nations top 5 hospitals for cancer care by the U.S. News &amp; World 
Reports 2024-2025 rankings. In the same report, the center was also 
rated as high performing in six cancer procedures: lung cancer surgery, 
colon cancer surgery, prostate cancer surgery, gynecologic cancer 
surgery, gastroenterology and GI cancer surgery, and in the treatment 
of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma.
  City of Hope is the only freestanding National Cancer Institute-
designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in California that is not 
affiliated with a university. Their system in California includes the 
Duarte campus, a new cancer center in Orange County, and clinical 
locations across Southern California, along with cancer treatment 
centers and outpatient facilities in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Phoenix 
areas. City of Hope continues to be a national leader and innovator in 
a range of complex cancer types and innovative technologies, and 
because of them, hundreds of thousands of lives continue to be saved 
through these advances.
  I know firsthand of the dedication and devotion that City of Hope is 
committed to offering all who are in need, particularly to those from 
traditionally underserved communities. It has been a trusted 
institution in Southern California, offering superior care to the 
community for many decades.
  I congratulate City of Hope and all its staff on this well-deserved 
national recognition by U.S. World News &amp; Reports, and I wish them 
continued success.
I rise today to congratulate Major General 
Kenneth S. Hara, the Adjutant General of the State of Hawaii, on his 
retirement from the Hawaii National Guard after a celebrated 40 years 
of service to our state and our nation.
  As Hawaiis adjutant general, Major General Hara serves as commander 
of the Hawaii National Guard and the director of the Hawaii Emergency 
Management Agency. In those roles, he has led the states response to 
some of the most challenging and complex emergencies in Hawaiis 
history. In March 2020, just a few months after Major General Hara 
became the adjutant general, Governor Josh Green asked him to serve as 
the states incident commander for the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to his 
leadership, Hawaiis response to the pandemic was among the most 
successful in the country.
  Over the course of his career, Major General Hara also served as the 
dual status commander of Joint Task Force-50 in response to the Kilauea 
eruption and Hurricane Lane in 2018 and as commander of Task Force KOA 
after the 2006 Hawaii Island earthquake. And as a First Lieutenant over 
thirty years ago, he played a key role in supporting the states 
response to Hurricane Iniki in 1992.
  But what I will most remember Major General Hara for is his role in 
leading the states response to the August 2023 wildfires on Maui and 
supporting their recovery. As the freshman representative for Hawaiis 
Second Congressional District that spans all eight of our islands, I am 
grateful to Major General Hara for his work in coordinating the states 
response to this unprecedented disaster in our states history 
alongside our local and federal partners.
  Throughout his career in the National Guard, Major General Hara 
deployed three times. In 2005, he deployed to Baghdad, Iraq in support 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom as commander of the 299th Infantrys 2nd 
Battalion. In 2008, he deployed to Kuwait as deputy commander of the 
29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Then, in 2012, this time as 
commander of the 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, he deployed to 
Kandahar in Afghanistan.
  His many awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense 
Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star with one 
Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, the Meritorious Service Medal with three 
Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters, the Army Aviator Badge, and the Combat 
Infantryman Badge.
  Major General Haras career continued a legacy of service that began 
with his late father, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Hara. Alongside his 
three brothers, Major General Hara has ensured that the Hara name is 
synonymous with service to our state and the nation.
  This career dedicated to service has also been a family commitment, 
and I would be remiss if I did not also thank Major General Haras wife 
Myoung and his children Kristin, Julia, Nichole, Justin, and Alicia. 
Their support and sacrifice made his success possible for all of us.
  As he and his entire family transition to a new chapter, I proudly 
join them in celebrating a tremendous career that will continue to 
inspire and motivate future generations of leaders. But even more 
importantly, I wish them all the best in enjoying a well-earned 
retirement.
  Mahalo to Ken for all that he has done and given to Hawaii and our 
country.
I rise today to recognize the 
hometown heroes, first responders and law enforcement, who keep us safe 
every day. In recognition of National Police Week in May, my office put 
out a call for nominations for the first NJ-07 Law Enforcement Hometown 
Heroes initiative. Twenty-two law enforcement professionals from across 
New Jerseys 7th Congressional District were nominated by their chiefs 
and supervisors for the outstanding work they do every day. It is my 
honor to play a small role in recognizing their efforts as a token of 
appreciation for the difficult and often thankless task of keeping our 
communities safe. I will always support these men and women in blue, 
and I look forward to welcoming each of these hometown heroes to a 
ceremony in October to formally recognize them in-person. In 
recognition of their bravery and commitment, I would like to include in 
the Record the names of these twenty-two Hometown Heroes:
  Officer Alyse Brown, Sparta Township Police Department, Staff 
Sergeant Brent Hawkswell, New Jersey State Police, Officer Connor 
Strohm, Readington Township Police Department, Sergeant Daniel Kern,

I rise in recognition of Tom Raffio on 
receiving the Walter R. Peterson Award for Education and Public 
Service. The Walter R. Peterson Award for Education and Public Service 
is presented to an individual whose contributions best exemplify the 
late governors values of public service and dedication to higher 
education.
  As a passionate civic leader, Toms community leadership spans across 
numerous New Hampshire organizations that support local education 
initiatives, youth programs, health causes, and the arts. Tom believes 
in the importance of access and affordability to quality post-secondary 
education for all New Hampshire residents.
  Under Toms leadership, the Northeast Delta Dental Foundation is 
committed to improving oral health care accessibility and education. 
This Foundation supports oral health programs each year throughout New 
Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine. It also addresses the shortage of 
dentists in under-served communities by raising funding for medicine 
scholarships and dental education loan repayment programs. In New 
Hampshire, one of the dental health education programs serves adult 
clients with disabilities, many of whom encounter oral health 
challenges. Further expanding its community impact under Toms 
leadership, it has grown to include numerous local community partners 
to join this philanthropic mission.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshires First Congressional 
District, I want to extend my gratitude to Tom Raffio for his 
exceptional commitment to serving New Hampshire. We thank Tom for his 
leadership and contributions to advance health equity and the overall 
wellness of our local communities. His work has enriched so many lives 
and is an inspiration for us all to join together and improve the lives 
of our community members.
today I introduce the ``San Pablo Bay 
National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act. I thank U.S. Senator Alex 
Padilla (D-CA) for sponsoring the companion legislation and my 
colleagues, Congressmen Jared Huffman (D-CA) and Mike Thompson (D-CA) 
for cosponsoring my bill.
  The San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge is one of Californias 
treasured places, protecting more than 24,390 acres of tidal marshes 
and wetlands in the north San Francisco Bay Area. As part of the 
Pacific Flyway, the National Wildlife Refuge provides critical habitat 
for endangered species and migratory birds.
  The ``San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act would 
add approximately 5,658 acres of adjacent baylands owned by the State 
of California and the nonprofit Sonoma Land Trust to the National 
Wildlife Refuges boundary. This expansion would increase the National 
Wildlife Refuges acreage by more than 23 percent, supporting President 
Bidens ``America the Beautiful National Conservation Goal to protect 
and conserve at least 30 percent of the lands and waters in the United 
States by 2030 and Governor Newsoms similar conservation goal for the 
State of California.
  Conserving Californias special places has been a lifelong passion 
throughout my tenure in the State Legislature, as Deputy Secretary of 
the Interior to President Clinton, and now as a Member of Congress 
representing Solano County. San Pablo Bay is one of those special 
places. This bill will help to restore the saltmarshes in San Pablo Bay 
for future generations and increase outdoor recreation opportunities 
for Bay Area residents and visitors alike.
  Importantly, this bill does not infringe upon state interests or 
individual property owners and prevents the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service from using eminent domain to acquire properties within the 
expanded boundaries. Instead, the bill directs the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service to only acquire land within the newly extended 
boundary from willing sale or donation. Furthermore, the bill 
encourages the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to engage in cooperative 
management with state agencies to better manage the National Wildlife 
Refuge and nearby state conservation lands within the San Pablo Bay 
watershed.
  This bill is inspired by the tireless efforts of the late U.S. 
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and the late Congressman Don Edwards 
(D-CA) to restore and conserve the Bay Areas saltmarshes and wetlands. 
Thanks to their leadership and steadfast work, the Don Edwards San 
Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in the South Bay now encompasses 
over 30,000 acres of habitat for millions of migratory birds and 
endangered species. It is an honor to continue Senator Feinstein and 
Congressman Edwards legacy of protecting and restoring resilient 
bayland ecosystems that benefit both wildlife, people, and our planet.
  The ``San Pablo National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act takes a 
critical step toward preserving the Bay Areas ecological diversity and 
ensuring the resilience of our communities as we continue fighting the 
climate crisis. I thank the hundreds of Bay Area residents and 
Californians who participated in the public comment period on my draft 
bill announced in September 2023. Their thoughtful comments and 
overwhelming support made this a stronger bill.
  My colleagues and I are honored to introduce this bill to help 
restore vital ecosystems and improve the north Bays climate resiliency 
by preserving one of Californias special places for future 
generations. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to join us in 
cosponsoring this bill.
