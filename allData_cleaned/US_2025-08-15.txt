I rise today to honor Cabe Monroe Lambert, 
the last living World War II Veteran of the Eastern Band of the 
Cherokee Indians. Mr. Lambert was born on September 25, 1926, and 
currently lives in the Wolftown community on the Qualla Boundary in 
Cherokee, North Carolina. Mr. Lambert is deeply loved by his community 
and family.
  As a member of the greatest generation, Mr. Lambert answered the call 
of the free world and served in the United States Army during World War 
II. While in combat, Cabe Monroe Lambert fought the Axis Powers that 
were advancing across independent, sovereign countries. Mr. Lambert 
prevented forces with evil intent from reaching our great country and 
liberated countless people. We owe a debt that we can never repay but 
will always remember and honor. Without brave men and women like Mr. 
Lambert, our world would undoubtedly be a much darker place.
, but 
pushed them back island by island, freeing the inhabitants of those 
communities. It is my distinct honor to acknowledge the service of Cabe 
Monroe Lambert to the United States of America and to our world.
I rise today to honor 
California Waterfowl as it celebrates 80 years of dedicated 
conservation service. This organizations decades long work protecting 
Californias waterfowl and wetland resources has made it the largest 
state-based waterfowl group in the United States and a vital force for 
environmental stewardship in our state and district.
  California Waterfowl was founded in 1945 as the Duck Hunters 
Association of California by hunters concerned about the rapid loss of 
wetlands. At the time, California had already lost 90 percent of its 
original wetlands, and few resources were dedicated to reversing this 
trend. In 1985, the organization partnered with the California 
Department of Fish and Wildlife to conduct studies that revealed most 
mallards harvested by hunters in the state were hatched locally, a 
finding that underscored the importance of in-State habitat to the 
health of the entire Pacific Flyway.
  Today, California Waterfowl includes more than 20,000 members united 
by a shared vision of a California abundant in waterfowl, vibrant 
wetlands, and thriving hunting communities. Over the past four decades, 
the organization has invested $280 million in conservation efforts and 
completed more than 1,500 projects to protect, restore, and enhance 
nearly 730,000 acres of waterfowl habitat statewide. More than half of 
these projects occurred on public lands, including significant work in 
the Suisun Marsh and California Delta. Recognizing the importance of 
agriculture to conservation, California Waterfowl has also partnered 
with landowners through programs such as the Delayed Wheat Harvest 
Incentive, Rice Levee and Agricultural Corridors Program, and Fallow 
Agriculture Program to support nesting waterfowl and pollinators while 
maintaining productive farmland.
  The organizations research and education efforts have contributed 
significantly to wildlife science and public awareness. Its Wood Duck 
Program has successfully hatched more than one million ducklings and 
distributed over 165,000 wood duck boxes. More than 180,000 students 
have participated in their conservation education programs. In 2009, 
the Hunt Program was launched to improve land access for hunters, now 
serving nearly 2,000 participants annually. The Veteran Hunt Program 
has supported over 5,000 service members, while broader outreach 
efforts have introduced more than 28,000 Californians to hunting and 
outdoor stewardship.
, California Waterfowls 80 years of conservation 
leadership have helped restore and protect hundreds of thousands of 
acres of critical habitat while educating generations of Californians 
about the importance of wetland conservation. Their work continues to 
benefit our state and districts wildlife, agriculture, and outdoor 
recreation opportunities. It is fitting and proper that we honor them 
today for their outstanding service to our regions natural resources 
and conservation heritage.
I rise today to honor Dario 
Sattui and his V. Sattui Winery as they celebrate 50 years of 
winemaking excellence in our Napa Valley. Mr Sattuis vision, 
dedication to our community,

and commitment to environmental stewardship have made V. Sattui one of 
our most treasured wineries and a cornerstone of Napa Valleys 
agricultural heritage.
  Born in San Francisco in 1941 to George and Lucille Sattui, Mr. 
Sattui grew up understanding the importance of family legacy and hard 
work. He earned his bachelor of science in accounting and finance from 
San Jose State University in 1965, followed by his master of business 
administration with an emphasis in Marketing from the University of 
California, Berkeley in 1969.
  The story of V. Sattui Winery began in 1885 when Mr. Sattuis great-
grandfather, Vittorio Sattui, immigrated from Genoa, Italy, and 
established a thriving San Francisco winery that operated for 35 years 
before Prohibition forced its closure. In 1975, nearly four decades 
later, Mr. Sattui revived the family dream by re-establishing V. Sattui 
Winery in our Napa Valley. When the winery opened its doors on March 4, 
1976, it became the 46th winery to operate in Napa Valley since 
Prohibition, with Mr. Sattuis vision of creating a Napa dItalia where 
guests could experience the good life through exceptional wine and warm 
hospitality.
  V. Sattuis commitment to excellence has been widely recognized. The 
winery has been named ``Winery of the Year at the California State 
Fair four times, earned the title ``Best Winery in the Western U.S. 
at the Critics Challenge Wine Competition, and received ``Domestic 
Winery of the Year from the San Diego International Wine &amp; Spirits 
Challenge. In 2023, V. Sattui converted to 100 percent organic farming 
across 200 acres spanning four counties, demonstrating Mr. Sattuis 
dedication to sustainable agriculture and environmental protection.
He has donated $1.6 million to support the Calistoga Boys &amp; 
Girls Club and contributed $1 million to the Calistoga School District 
to expand its preschool program. His generosity has also benefited St. 
Helena Public Schools Foundation, Napa Valley education programs, and 
disaster relief efforts, including a $100,000 contribution to support 
victims of the 2017 fires. Through conservation easements with the Land 
Trust of Napa Valley, Mr Sattui has also protected more than 600 acres 
from future development, ensuring these lands remain available for 
agriculture and open space in perpetuity.
$4.5 million donation to the Gladstone Institute for heart 
health research. He has also supported innovative environmental 
initiatives, including his investment in Resynergi of Santa Rosa to 
convert plastic waste into energy, and his support for Meals on Wheels 
of Napa Valley through the purchase of a new food delivery truck.
. The Sattui family continues 
to operate V. Sattui as a direct-to-consumer winery, and is one of the 
few wineries in our Napa Valley established prior to 1980 that are 
still operating today with the original founding families. The Sattui 
family remains committed to maintaining the personal touch and 
authentic experience that has made it a destination where generations 
of families return time and again.
, Dario Sattui and V. Sattui Winerys 50 years of 
winemaking excellence, environmental stewardship, and community service 
have profoundly shaped Napa Valleys cultural and agricultural 
landscape. It is fitting and proper that we honor them today for their 
remarkable contributions to our community and their unwavering 
commitment to preserving our valleys heritage while inspiring future 
generations.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF NORTHGLENN PDS DETECTIVE PAUL GESI
it is with a heavy heart that I 
rise today to honor the life and service of Detective Paul Gesi--a hero 
whose dedication to the ideals of justice and the protection of his 
community spanned more than four decades.
  Paul devoted 41 years of his life to public service through law 
enforcement, 39 of them with the Northglenn Police Department, where he 
served as the departments Homicide Detective. That noble work is 
demanding in every sense--it calls for skill, persistence, and deep 
compassion. Paul brought all of those qualities to the job and more. He 
passionately pursued the truth and justice in the cases that he worked 
to honor the victims of serious crimes. When families in our community 
grappled with the grief that accompanies the loss of a loved one, 
Detective Gesi was a gentle presence and steady hand to help comfort 
those suffering unimaginable pain.
  But Pauls service was not confined to his career. He served as a 
teacher at the Citizens Police Academy, spoke with students in local 
schools, and was a trusted friend to many in the community. He lived 
out his faith in Christ every day, and he was a devoted single father 
to six children, raising them with the same love and strength he 
projected in the force.
  Last week, after a long battle with post-traumatic stress disorder 
brought on by the burdens of his work, Paul left us. The loss of this 
titan in the Northglenn Police Department is a sobering, painful 
reminder of the unseen wounds that can come with a life spent 
protecting others. During their career, the average police officer will 
experience 178 life-threatening situations; the average citizen will 
experience three.
  Detective Gesi leaves behind a deep void--in his family, among his 
fellow officers, and across the City of Northglenn. Yet his example of 
courage, integrity, and selfless service will endure. As we, alongside 
his family and the City of Northglenn, make our final goodbyes, we do 
so with gratitude for his life and with a renewed commitment to care 
for the first responders and protectors who bear the weight of 
protecting our communities.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Detective 
Paul Gesi for his service, for his sacrifice, and for the countless 
lives in my district made better by his work. May we remember him 
always, and may God grant comfort and peace to all who mourn his loss. 
May he rest easy. We have the watch from here.
INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION AFFIRMING THE PRESIDENTS PROMISE NOT TO 
                                of ohio
today I introduced a Resolution Affirming 
the Presidents Promise Not to Raise the Social Security and Medicare 
Retirement Age.
  Social Security and Medicare are solemn promises made to generations 
of American workers who have paid into these hard-earned benefits 
during their working years.
  Yesterday, Social Security celebrated its 90th birthday, and our 
resolution demonstrates continued support from Congress for this 
program so it can continue to support Americans throughout their 
retirement for decades to come.
  As more than 11,000 Americans turn 65 each day, many will turn to 
these programs to access care and start their retirement. It is our 
duty to ensure these programs will be here for them to utilize in their 
golden years and not create delays to access these benefits.
  Raising the retirement age would reduce benefits for millions of 
Americans, placing an unnecessary burden on seniors and those close to 
retirement who cant afford to wait to access their earned benefits.
  I promise to oppose any changes to the retirement age for these vital 
national programs, just as President Trump stated on July 8, 2024. I 
agree with President Trump that we mustnt raise the Social Security 
and Medicare Retirement Age.
  In a time of division, Im glad to be able to find issues where 
people from both parties can agree.
  I thank my colleagues who have already joined my resolution, and I 
urge all my colleagues to consider supporting this resolution which 
demonstrates the House of Representatives dedication to protect 
retirement security by not raising the retirement age.
RECOGNIZING ASSUMPTION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY PARISHS 75TH 
                            of pennsylvania
I rise today to recognize an incredible 
parish from my district--Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVM) 
Parish in Feasterville, Pennsylvania. This year, Assumption BVM 
celebrates its 75th Anniversary, an exceptional milestone that reflects 
decades of spiritual dedication and charitable impact. It is my honor 
to commend the parish on this remarkable achievement.
  Since its founding on November 3, 1950, Assumption BVM has dedicated 
themselves to ministry and outreach. By offering a welcoming place for 
worship to the residents of Feasterville, Langhorne, Oakford, and 
Trevose, the parish has been a steadfast presence in Bucks County for 
three-quarters of a century.
  Celebrating 75 years as a parish also means celebrating 75 years as 
their self-titled Family of Faith. Through grounding their lives in 
love and faith, Assumption BVM has become a source of strength, 
spiritual growth, and support for countless individuals.
  Assumption BVM works alongside the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to 
assist people who struggle to afford basic necessities. To help ease 
these burdens, Assumption BVM collects grocery store gift cards and 
other monetary donations for those in need.
  Their outreach also includes the Caring for Friends program, which 
provides home-cooked meals to individuals facing food insecurity. 
Additional efforts include a community meal program with Advocates for 
Homeless and Those in Need, and the Change for Life Baby Bottle 
Project, which supports families in crisis. And yet, these examples 
capture only a fraction of Assumption BVMs deep commitment to serving 
those in need.
  The parishs Knights of Columbus chapter provides even more 
opportunities for parishioners to engage in charitable outreach, 
sponsoring events such as spring pancake breakfasts and baseball 
outings that bring people together in fellowship and service.
  It is my honor to celebrate 75 years of faith, generosity, and 
service at Assumption BVM. Bucks County is a stronger, more 
compassionate place because of the enduring presence of this 
extraordinary parish. I am proud to celebrate Assumption BVM on this 
remarkable milestone.
I rise today to recognize the valuable 
contributions of Americans for Native Americans (ANA), a dedicated 
organization primarily supported by benefactors from Central Bucks 
County, which lies within my district in Pennsylvania.
  ANA is dedicated to improving the lives of Native Americans in the 
Hopi, Navajo, and Zuni Nations in the American Southwest. By providing 
essential goods and services, ANA addresses critical community needs 
while serving as a foundation for greater self-reliance and long-term 
empowerment.
  Connie and Bill Eastburn founded this organization by recognizing 
pressing needs in these Native American communities--warmth, structure, 
and shelter. When they learned that 17 Navajo men had tragically passed 
away due to inadequate shelter, Connie and Bill jumped into action. 
Now, partnered with numerous organizations, they have been committed to 
helping and improving the lives of Native Americans in the American 
Southwest.
  One facet of ANAs outreach efforts includes programs focused on 
supporting the wellbeing and education of Native American children. The 
largest program, Food for Kids, provides schoolchildren with much-
needed meals. With the help of ANAs generous donors, the programs 
funding skyrocketed from $10,000 in 2004 to $178,400 in 2024-2025. 
Other programs include Clothing for Kids, Eyeglass Program, and the 
Family and Child Education Program--all of which support and empower 
these children and their families.
  In addition, ANA supports the education of University of New Mexico-
Gallup nursing students. By providing scholarships and financial aid to 
aspiring Native American nurses since 2006, ANA has sponsored 349 
Associate Degrees in Nursing through its Advanced Degree Scholarships--
totaling $318,278 of educational aid. By investing in the next 
generation of healthcare professionals, ANA helps establish pathways 
toward self-reliance, economic opportunity, and improved health 
services within these Native American communities.
  Furthermore, ANA pilots a program providing free veterinary care for 
Native Americans and their animals on Navajo and Zuni reservations. In 
partnership with various Zuni organizations, ANA began construction of 
a fully self-sustainable veterinary clinic--a vital step toward 
achieving their goal of equipping these communities with the resources 
needed for self-sufficiency.
  Americans for Native Americans continues to leave an indelible mark 
on the Hopi, Navajo, and Zuni Nations in the American Southwest. I rise 
to recognize the incredible accomplishments of this esteemed 
organization and I commemorate their efforts and dedication. Through 
the endless passion and dedication of Central Bucks County residents, 
this organization demonstrates their unwavering commitment to serving 
these communities.
I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding member of our community, Executive Director of the 
Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations Jeffrey B.

Quakertown community, and I am honored to congratulate him on his well-
deserved retirement. His efforts have made an everlasting impact on 
generations of students, enriching their lives through music education 
and inspiring a deep appreciation for the arts.
I rise to pay tribute to the 
Brothers Keepers Motorcycle Club of Kentucky. What started out as a 
group of firefighters whose main purpose was to strengthen their 
brotherhood through recreational motorcycle rides, has now grown into a 
club with much greater purpose.
  The Brothers Keepers Motorcycle Club focuses on safety and 
motorcycle awareness nationwide. However, realizing the strength of 
their unity, these firefighting bikers have turned their fun and 
relaxation into fundraising and charitable work. For example, their 
Kentucky chapters collectively support the Shriners Hospital and 
Transportation, Scars Uncovered, and the Hoosier Burn Camp for Kids. 
The five chapters in Kentucky include Lexington, Louisville, 
Campbellsville, Sturgis, and Paintsville. Together, they host the Burn 
Run, a two-day event for charity that has resulted in more than 
$300,000 in funding for pediatric burn victims.
  Every day, our firefighters bravely answer the call of duty to save 
lives and rescue homes, businesses, and community facilities from total 
destruction. The charitable work of this club is evidence that a true 
heart of service never clocks out when an emergency ends. Even in their 
spare time, they are serving and protecting the most innocent lives in 
Kentucky by raising support for young burn victims. Thanks to their 
fundraising efforts, more essential resources are available for 
families, including educational programs, healthcare initiatives, and 
recreational opportunities for patients who need them the most.
  I salute the Brothers Keepers Motorcycle Club of Kentucky for 
providing a beacon of hope for families across the Commonwealth, going 
far beyond the call of duty to help those in need.
