Black History is American History.
  The annual observance of Black History Month is more than a 
chronological account of our past, it is that of our present and our 
future.
  Its about the joy, the culture, the resistance, the fight, and how 
far Black Americans have come in this country.
  Celebrating our Black communities and Black history is so important, 
especially now, in times like this where values of diversity, equity 
and inclusion are under attack.
  But despite that we move forward in the steps of our ancestors and in 
the steps of joy and resistance. That is why it is my honor to 
recognize the 2025 Black Luminaries of Floridas 10th Congressional 
District who have transformed lives and inspired generations, these 
luminaries are:
.
--Executive Director of Guardian Care 
     Nursing and Rehabilitation Center.
       Lashea C. Reaves--Executive Director of 8 cent in a Jar.
       Inez Long (posthumously)--Long-time President and CEO of 
     the Black Business Investment Fund (BBIF) Florida, and co-
     founder of the African American Alliance of CDFI CEOs.
       Dr. Jeffrey Redding--2019 winner of the prestigious Grammy 
     award, The Music Educator Award and a UCF Director of Choral 
     Activities.
--Boxing Bronze medalist from the 2024 
     Olympics.

       Gene Martin--Founder &amp; Executive Director--Route 7.
       Retired Elder/Reverend Henry L. Postell, II.--Owner of 
     Postell Mortuary.
I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
group of interns who have supported the work of the 20th District of 
California this spring. These bright and driven young people--serving 
in my Washington, D.C. office and my Bakersfield, California office--
have brought a spirit of dedication and enthusiasm that enriched our 
team. At a time when many young Americans are questioning the role of 
public service, their eagerness to engage with the federal government 
on behalf of their communities offers real encouragement for the future 
of our Nation.
  With their time in Congress reaching its close, I want to extend my 
heartfelt thanks to Jonathan Clark, Justin Gibbins, and Jack Putrino 
for their work in my Washington, D.C. office, and Ava Dykes for her 
service in my Bakersfield, California office. Their hard work and 
dedication have been invaluable, and I hope that the experiences gained 
here will serve them well in their future endeavors.
I rise today to celebrate the 
74th birthday of Eric L. Thompson, Sr. Born on April 3, 1951 in 
Chicago, Illinois. Eric has been a lifelong resident of Chicago and a 
beloved member of our community.
  As a young man, Eric was inspired by the civil rights advocacy of his 
parents, who frequently worked with my father, Reverend Jesse L. 
Jackson, Sr. to advance civil rights through Operation Rainbow PUSH.
  Eric attended Augustana College and later went on to start his own 
businesses, T&amp;T Food Service, and Eridor Food Service, Inc., named in 
honor of his sons, Eric and Dorian. Through his hard work and keen 
business skills, Eric has grown his businesses into the preeminent food 
service providers in the Chicago area.
  In addition to being an accomplished businessman, Eric is also known 
for his friendly spirit and kindness. To know Eric is to know a friend. 
As Eric looks back on 74 wonderful years, I hope he is able to rest on 
his laurels and enjoy celebrating his accomplishments with his family 
and friends. I wish him many more years of good health.
, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating this 
momentous occasion.
I rise to celebrate the life of 
Paul Roger Dionne, who passed away on April 17, 2025. A pillar of the 
Lewiston community, Paul spent his life in service to others.
  As a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, Paul 
earned two Bronze Stars and two Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry. After 
returning home, Paul met his best friend and soulmate, Diane (LeBlanc), 
and they married in 1970. Together, they built a home and raised two 
daughters, Melodie and Michelle, and later welcomed five grandchildren.
  In addition to Pauls service to his country, he also served the 
people of Maine. Leading his community as Assistant District Attorney 
and as Mayor of Lewiston, Paul was instrumental in bringing the 
University of Maine system to Lewiston (UMLA). Later in his career, 
Paul was appointed Maines first Executive Director of the Workers 
Compensation Board, serving under Governors King and Baldacci. In this 
role Paul fought for workers rights and is remembered for his 
compassion and tact.
  However, Pauls greatest impact was on his beloved community of 
Lewiston. A staple at every community event, Paul was a member of the 
Chamber of Commerce, led the Central Maine Medical Center Board of 
Trustees, and earned recognition as one of Lewistons Citizens of the 
Year. Additionally, Paul coached hundreds of students on the Lewiston 
High School Mock Trial Team, which he did proudly alongside his 
daughter.
  Remembered by many for his big smile, and his love for one another, 
he lifted up his community. Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am 
honored to pay tribute to Paul Dionne.

service of our brave men and women for Armed Forces Day, May 17, 2025.

I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of Bernard J. McCullough, better known as ``Bernie Mac by 
his fans. Born on the south side of Chicago on October 5,1957, Bernie 
would go on to become a singular comedic talent who spent his entire 
career in show business, bringing laughter and joy to his audiences.
  To his fans and a world that adored him, he was comedian Bernie Mac. 
But his real name was Bernard Jeffery McCullough born October 5, 1957 
as the second child of Mary McCullough and Jeffery Harrison, who had 
already made their life transition. Bernard, or ``Bernie, as he was 
affectionately named, grew up in the gang-ridden Englewood Community of 
Chicago. Always a leader and not a follower, he gained the respect of 
most of the gang members without ever joining. He was forever the clown 
and always known for making people laugh. He accepted Jesus Christ at a 
young age and attended Burning Bush Missionary Baptist Church.
  His big break came in 1990 when he won first place with a remarkable 
performance in the Miller Lite Comedy Search. From that point, his 
popularity spread, and he garnered attention prompting Russell Simmons 
to give him a spot on his groundbreaking show Def Comedy Jam. Bernards 
first stage appearance was so well received that he was invited back to 
perform a second time. From that moment on, the Mac Man was a 
phenomenon. He would soon go on tour as the opening act for Chaka Khan, 
Barry White, the Whispers and many other performers.
  Bernie made his film debut with the release of Mo Money in 1992. His 
breakthrough performance, however, came in his role as Pastor Cleaver 
in Ice Cubes hit movie, Friday (1995).
  Bernie Macs comedy was raw, honest, and fearless. His stand-up often 
revolved around his personal experiences, delivered with his signature 
raspy voice and bold stage presence. He gained widespread recognition 
as one of the four comedians in the 2000 stand-up film The Original 
Kings of Comedy, where his set stole the show with its hilarious takes 
on family and discipline. The Bernie Mac Show, his self-titled sitcom, 
was a groundbreaking hit, blending humor with heartfelt moments as he 
played a fictionalized version of himself raising his sisters kids. 
The show earned multiple awards and cemented his place in TV history. 
Bernie transitioned seamlessly into acting, appearing in films like 
Oceans Eleven, Mr. 3000, and Guess Who. His charisma made him stand 
out in every role he took on.
  Even after his passing in 2008, Bernie Mac remains a beloved figure 
in comedy. His fearless approach and unique comedic style continue to 
influence comedians today, impacting hundreds of lives still. Bernie 
launched The Bernie Mac Foundation in Chicago, Illinois in 2005 as 
Founder and Chairman of the Board to bring awareness to sarcoidosis and 
build a bridge between awareness and a cure. He dedicated his mission 
to informing the community on the impact of sarcoidosis to patients and 
transform the opinions of treatment. Bernie used his celebrity to 
support the Bernie Mac Sarcoidosis Translational Advanced Research 
(STAR) Center at the University of Illinois Health Sciences System to 
provide patients with outstanding care. He was also passionate about 
patients receiving evaluations in a timely, compassionate and courteous 
manner for all forms of sarcoidosis.
, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the life 
and legacy of Bernard J. McCullough.

Service Unit within Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida, and has

perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to truly make the world a 
better place.

administrators, educating community members about the harmful effects 
of bullying, and creating a motivational mural to be displayed at her

come.
