Mr Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Black 
Maternal Health Week, to urgently address the ongoing epidemic 
surrounding the mortality and health of Black mothers, and to implore 
this esteemed body to take decisive action on legislation that can help 
reverse this alarming reality.
  Women in America are tragically dying at a higher rate from 
pregnancy-related causes than in any other developed nation. The 
disparities are even more stark for Black women, who are three times 
more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than their white 
counterparts. This heartbreaking statistic is rooted in a long history 
of systemic racism and bias. Studies reveal that Black women facing 
severe injuries or pregnancy complications, or simply seeking 
assistance, are often dismissed or overlooked in healthcare settings 
that should prioritize their care--a stark truth regardless of 
socioeconomic status. A recent study highlighted that even the 
wealthiest Black mothers and their babies face twice the risk of 
mortality compared to their white counterparts. This disparity 
transcends income, as high-income Black women and low-income white 
women experience similar rates of childbirth-related deaths. 
Additionally, many nonaffluent Black mothers lack access to safe 
housing, affordable transportation, and nutritious food--essential 
elements that profoundly impact maternal health. Systemic injustice in 
our health care and other national capabilities threatens the lives and 
well-being of all Black mothers, who are unequivocally American 
mothers.
  We cannot allow these inequities to persist when potential solutions 
exist. I urge my esteemed colleagues to rally behind the efforts and 
legislation of the Black Maternal Caucus, dedicated to addressing these 
pressing concerns and championing the welfare of Black mothers. A 
crucial step forward is the passage of The Black Maternal Health 
Momnibus Act, H.R. 3305 comprising 13 vital bills aimed at tackling 
this crisis and promoting healthcare equity for Black mothers. The 
Momnibus encompasses measures to enhance healthcare and economic 
support for Black mothers, bolster our federal and community capacity 
to understand and rectify this crisis, and expand and diversify our 
perinatal workforce to better serve Black mothers. This monumental 
legislation is cosponsored by 193 of my House Democratic colleagues, 32 
senators, and backing from 200 stakeholder organizations.
  The Momnibus Act can be a vital first step in forging an America 
where Black mothers can flourish. Let us unite in our commitment to 
ensure the health and well-being of all mothers, regardless of race or 
socioeconomic status, as we strive towards a future where every mother 
receives the care and support she deserves.
I rise today to extend my heartfelt 
congratulations to the Food Shed Co-op family on their achievement in 
organizing and establishing a community-owned grocery store. The 
concept of establishing a cooperative emerged from discussions among a 
group of friends seeking to strengthen their community. They 
collectively decided to create a community-owned store in McHenry 
County, embarking on an unpredictable and awe-inspiring journey. Their 
dedication to bringing this dream to fruition is truly commendable.
  Food Shed Co-op is more than a simple grocery store, it is a symbol 
of the determination of the community. It is committed to providing 
everyone with access to fresh, locally sourced, and sustainably 
produced food. With a mission to support local farmers and producers, 
reduce environmental impact, and foster a sense of community, Food Shed 
Co-op is a shining example of what can be achieved when like-minded 
individuals come together for a common cause.
  Nearly 2,100 people purchased equity shares in the co-op, reflecting 
the strong support of the community during the projects development 
and grand launch. This steady belief in Food Shed Co-ops mission 
speaks volumes about the communitys commitment to building a vibrant, 
neighborhood-focused supermarket that is accessible to everyone.
  I am proud to represent such an innovative group of individuals who 
continually strive to uplift their community and applaud the vital work 
they are doing to create a healthier and more sustainable future in 
McHenry County. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Food Shed 
Co-op in celebrating their grand opening.
I rise to commemorate the 30th anniversary 
of the Opportunity Center for the Homeless.
  Since its inception on January 3rd, 1994, the Opportunity Center has 
been a steadfast refuge for homeless adults, originally focusing on men 
but expanding to accommodate the increasing number of women seeking 
shelter. Through this evolution, it has established permanent and 
transitional housing options to offer stability and hope to those in 
need.
  Central to the Centers philosophy is the principle of recovery to 
service. It proudly stands as the largest employer of homeless 
individuals in the El Paso community, with close to 60 percent of its 
staff having lived experience with homelessness. This practice not only 
provides employment but also fosters a sense of purpose, self-worth, 
empathy, and dignity among its employees. In a landmark achievement in 
October 2011, the Opportunity Center became the first homeless shelter 
in the United States to receive excess food from schools, thanks to 
Congressional clarification on food donation regulations. This 
initiative has since provided over 1.2 million meals in 2023 alone, 
nourishing those in need and exemplifying the Centers commitment to 
holistic support.
  Founded by Ray Tullius, a U.S. Army veteran and Golden Nugget award 
recipient, the Center is dedicated to aiding veterans facing 
homelessness and has assisted countless individuals. By fostering 
collaboration among stakeholders, such as service providers, 
educational institutions, and local governments, the Opportunity Center 
ensures high-quality care and compassion for those experiencing 
homelessness.
  Today, it is my privilege to honor the Opportunity Center for its 30-
year legacy of service, resilience, and compassion. May it continue to 
make a profound impact on the lives of our community for many years to 
come.
``FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA, PALESTINE WILL BE FREE IS ANTISEMITIC 
                     AND ITS USE MUST BE CONDEMNED
I will vote in support of H. Res. 
883, a non-binding resolution that condemns the use of a slogan that 
has been used by some individuals and groups for antisemitic purposes, 
including as a rallying cry to deny the right to self-determination of 
the Jewish people or even to eliminate the State of Israel from the 
Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.
  I believe the antisemitic use of this slogan should rightfully be 
condemned. For example, this slogan has been widely used by terrorist 
entities--including Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and 
Hezbollah--to encourage future attacks on Israel, the Jewish community 
and Jewish institutions. With antisemitism and antisemitic attacks on 
the rise in the U.S. and around the world, we must swiftly condemn 
antisemitism in all its forms.
  However, this resolution should have been written better. For 
example, H. Res. 883, fails to acknowledge that some who use the phrase 
do so to advocate for Palestinian liberation and equality, and others--
including some members of the Jewish community--use the phrase to 
advocate for an end to the Israeli control and annexation of the West 
Bank and Gaza. The resolution should have noted that this slogan is not 
always intended to be used as antisemitic and not all who use the 
phrase are antisemitic.
  As with other resolutions this Congress, H. Res. 883 also fails to 
condemn antisemitic acts from those on the far-right, including white 
nationalists who have increasingly promoted antisemitic conspiracy 
theories and have threatened the lives and livelihoods of Jewish 
Americans.
  H. Res. 883 also treats the slogan ``from the river to the sea as 
one-sided. However, this phrase has also been used by right-wing 
Israelis--including by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself in January--to 
deny the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.
  Let me be clear: I believe that both Israelis and Palestinians have a 
right to their own state. Thats why I strongly support a two-state 
solution where Israelis and Palestinians recognize each others right 
to live in peace and have prosperity.
  I also unequivocally condemn all forms of antisemitism, and I am 
appalled by the significant rise in antisemitism weve seen in recent 
years and especially after Hamass October 7th terrorist attacks on 
Israel. If the House Republican majority were serious about tackling 
antisemitism, they would support President Bidens National Strategy to 
Counter Antisemitism, would quit trying to defund the Office of Civil 
Rights for Title VI enforcement which protects Jewish students, and 
would increase funding for the High-Risk Nonprofit Grant Program to 
secure Jewish institutions as a start. I urge House Republicans to 
prioritize real action to combat hate, rather than continue to waste 
time and resources on non-binding resolutions.
  Thats why Ive cosponsored legislation that thoughtfully and 
powerfully condemns the rise of antisemitism in the United States and 
calls on Congress to support the above substantive actions to tackle 
antisemitism, which congressional Republicans have so far refused to 
do.
.R. 
4639.
  This bill raises important issues that must be addressed by Congress. 
Law enforcement agencies should not be able to circumvent due process 
by buying information about the targets of their operations from third-
party data brokers. The American people need a solution that covers 
federal, state, and local governments to ensure that their rights are 
fully protected.
  During legislative negotiations on H.R. 4639, members raised concerns 
about conflicting possible interpretations of this bill that were not 
addressed before it came to the floor. As currently drafted, it is not 
clear whether H.R. 4639 appropriately covers federal, state, and local 
governments or whether the scope is limited to only cover the federal 
government. I also have concerns about restrictions that H.R. 4639 
would impose on the Intelligence Communitys ability to protect our 
national security by collecting data on foreign individuals operating 
abroad.
  Given the ambiguity over the scope of H.R. 4639 and the challenges 
this bill would create for our ability to monitor foreign threats to 
the United States, I will vote PRESENT. I am hopeful these issues will 
be addressed by the Senate as they consider this legislation.
I include in the Record the following 
Proclamation honoring Carlo A. Scissura, President and CEO of The New

I rise today to honor Henderson County, 
N.C. resident Sgt. John Ashe in recognition of his service.
  This month, Sgt. Ashe retired from the Henderson County Sheriffs 
Office after a long and decorated career in law enforcement. He most 
recently worked as an officer in the Henderson County courthouse, where

I rise to recognize Dr. Robert Bunger 
Zufall, a beloved community healthcare leader from New Jersey. Dr. 
Zufall dedicated his life to serving others and leaves an incredible 
legacy in New Jerseys Eleventh Congressional District and beyond.
. He graduated from Princeton University and served our 
country in the Navy during World War II before continuing his education 
at Harvard Medical School. From his leadership in the military as U.S. 
Army First Lieutenant and Captain in the medical corps, to his service 
as a physician at Bellevue Hospital and Dover General Hospital, Dr. 
Zufall dedicated his life to caring for others.
  Dr. Zufalls most well-known achievement is the creation of Zufall 
Health, a Federally Qualified Health Center serving communities across 
Northern New Jersey. After several medical service trips to Peru, he 
and his wife Kay committed themselves to providing healthcare to those 
in need closer to home. Initially a once-a-week, one-room clinic, 
Zufall has since expanded to seven counties and two mobile sites that 
serve 48,000 New Jerseyians annually. The clinic has received many 
accolades, including the Jefferson Award given to Dr. Zufall and Kay in 
2009. Dr. Zufall, known lovingly by many as ``Dr. Bob, worked 
tirelessly to make sure that all New Jersey residents regardless of 
means have affordable access to healthcare.
  Dr. Zufall deeply cherished his family and enjoyed spending time with

Dr. Victor G. Alicea, Ph.D., is 
the founding President of Boricua College. He began his tenure at the 
College in 1974. During his time at Boricua College, he has proven his 
steadfast leadership and commitment to moving the institution forward 
at a time of unprecedented challenge to the health and financial well-
being of colleges and universities across the nation.
  ``The present is the only pathway that connects our past with our 
future, Dr. Victor G. Alicea, is often heard to remark. Always 
present in the ``here and now Victor Gabriel Alicea has worked 
tirelessly for the education and flourishing of all people of New York

I rise today in recognition of the 2nd 
Annual National Rendering Day. The burden of responsibility for feeding 
the world extends beyond the farm. Rendering plays a critical role in 
ensuring we can meet the growing global demand for food, feed, and 
fuel, while helping reduce food waste and loss. By recycling unused 
animal products, renderers create valuable ingredients from resources 
that would otherwise take up enormous amounts of precious landfill 
space. Renderers also collect billions of pounds of used cooking oil 
from restaurants and food manufacturers for upcycling into products and 
sustainable fuels, like biodiesel.
  Rendering not only creates alternative, sustainable fuels to power 
trucks, trains, water vessels and other vehicles but also feeds our 
beloved household pets. Rendering is the largest industry involved in 
prevention of food loss and waste and is an important component of a 
bio-circular economy.
  Renderers play an important role in reducing food loss and waste, 
sustainably recycling valuable agricultural resources, and positively 
contributing to local, state, and national and international economies. 
U.S. renderers contribute $10 billion in annual economic activity

across the country and include many small businesses that help drive 
the American economy and define the American dream.
  I am honored to represent many great rendering companies in the 4th 
District of Arkansas. I am grateful for the role of rendering in 
producing Americas feed and fuel, and reducing food waste and loss by 
repurposing products we dont eat for other practical needs. Today on 
National Rendering Day, please join me in recognizing renderers 
countless contributions to strengthening the U.S. economy and 
protecting the environment.
hunger and food insecurity are issues that 
plague many nations around the world. Luckily, within the district that 
I represent, there is an international organization working to 
alleviate this concern by working with farmers around the world to 
improve agricultural practices and teaching about advancements in 
fertilizer technology.
  Founded in October 1974, the International Fertilizer Development 
Center (IFDC) was created to fill a gap found in the inability to field 
international calls for assistance by the Tennessee Valley Authoritys 
National Fertilizer Development Center.
  After just shy of three years in operation, the IFDC was designated a 
public international organization in March 1977.
  On this 50th anniversary, the staff that makes up the IFDC are 
working just as hard as they were on day one to make sure people around 
the world do not just have access to food, but have the knowledge 
needed to grow this food so that they can create a sustainable 
agricultural process that will feed generations.
  The IFDC is headquartered in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and currently 
operates in over 25 countries. President and CEO Henk van Duijn, along 
with the rest of the International Fertilizer Development Centers 
Global Management Team, Dr. Oumou Camara, Chris Holt, Douglas Kerr, and 
.
  I want to thank each and everyone at the International Fertilizer 
Development Center for their 50 years of service to the international 
community. They have provided a way for people across the world to grow 
food and feed their communities. Congratulations to them on their 
incredible achievements and for representing the very best of the 
United States by making significant contributions to the international 
community. I look forward to continued great work and the success of 
everyone at IFDC.
I rise today to honor a loving 
husband, dedicated father, committed soldier and dear friend of 
longstanding, Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., USA (Ret.). Sadly, Colonel 
Puckett passed away on April 8, 2024. He leaves behind a legacy of 
service that will be emulated by many for years to come. A memorial 
service honoring his remarkable life will be held on April 20, 2024, at 
the National Infantry Museum Parade Field adjacent to Fort Moore, 
Georgia.
  Colonel Puckett was born on December 8, 1926, in Tifton, Georgia. He 
graduated from Baylor High School and then enrolled at Georgia Tech 
before enlisting in the United States Army during World War II. Colonel 
Puckett graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point 
in 1949. He was assigned as Infantry Lieutenant for the Eighth U.S. 
Army Ranger Company when the Korean War began.
  On November 25, 1950, during the Korean conflict, the First 
Lieutenant began a multiday operation with the Eighth Army Ranger 
Company, a company composed of 51 U.S. and nine Korean Soldiers against 
a barrage of Chinese Troops on Hill 205. During the initial assault, 
Colonel Puckett exposed himself to enemy fire, rallying pinned down 
U.S. troops to advance and take the hill from its defenders. In the 
following hours, the temperatures dropped, and the Chinese attempted to 
retake the hill. Colonel Puckett radioed an artillery strike to stop 
the enemys advance.
  Over the course of the attacks, Colonel Puckett sustained several 
wounds to his left shoulder, feet, thighs, and buttocks. Despite being 
severely wounded, he was still able to command his company and call on 
artillery to avert enemy attacks before being carried to safety by two 
of his troops.
  During his 22-year career, Colonel Puckett received many awards 
including the Distinguished Service Cross twice, along with two Silver 
Stars for valor, two Bronze Star medals, and five Purple Hearts. In 
1992, he became one of the first people to be inducted into the United 
States Army Ranger Hall of Fame.
  Because of his courageous valor and after many years of efforts on 
his behalf, Colonel Puckett was awarded the Medal of Honor by President 
Joseph R. Biden on Friday, May 21, 2021.
  Colonel Puckett gave himself to his country and to so many for so 
long. As such, he is one of our nations most decorated war heroes. 
Even after his military service ended, he found a way to give back to 
those who came after him. He remained very active with military 
affairs, including volunteering with the Ranger Brigade. Colonel 
Puckett also served as an executive with Outward Bound, a nonprofit 
educational organization that exposes students, especially those from 
cities, to wilderness settings.
  Colonel Puckett accomplished much in his life, but none of this would 
have been possible without the grace of God, and the enduring love and 
support of his wife, Jean, and their children Martha and Thomas.
, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, 
along with the 765,000 people of Georgias Second Congressional 
District in celebrating the life and legacy of Colonel Ralph Puckett, 
Jr., USA (Ret.). Moreover, we extend our deepest condolences to his 
family, friends, and all who mourn his loss. May they all be consoled 
and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, 
weeks, and months ahead.
