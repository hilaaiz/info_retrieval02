I am pleased to congratulate and recognize 
the Linville Hill Christian School boys basketball team on winning the 
Class 2A PIAA Championship on March 28, 2025.
  A small Christian school at the rural eastern edge of the 11th 
Congressional District, Linville Hill Christian School has defied 
expectations. After cruising through the regular season and the 
playoffs, the boys basketball team made their way to the Class 2A PIAA 
Championship game.
  Though they trailed with four minutes to go in the fourth quarter, 
late game heroism cut the deficit to a single point. Senior captain and 
Linville Hills all-time leading scorer, Stephen Smucker, then sank the 
go-ahead basket with under thirty seconds to go. A spectacular defense 
from Linville Hill Christian sealed a 55-54 victory. Their state title, 
the first in the programs history, crowned a historic 29-3 season. 
Coach Mike Schatzmann and the players of Linville Hill Christian School 
should be proud of this extraordinary accomplishment.
  I congratulate them on their Class 2A PIAA Basketball Championship 
and wish them the best in their future endeavors. I am certain that the 
lessons that each of these students learned on the court will continue 
to serve them well throughout their lives.
M.D.
I rise today to commemorate a beloved native 
son of Baltimore, Dr. Michael L. Zollicoffer, M.D. Dr. Z, as hes known 
to most of his patients, is a physician of boundless compassion and 
enthusiasm, and he has spent more than 35 years breaking down barriers 
to healthcare for all Baltimoreans, regardless of their ability to pay. 
His clinic has been a ray of hope for the under and uninsured, and his 
selfless commitment to healing has had major impacts on the wellbeing 
of his community.
. 
Lawrence Zollicoffer, co-founder of Garwyn Medical Center, one of 
Baltimores first Black-owned multi-specialty medical centers. Dr. Z 
followed in his fathers footsteps by attending the University of North 
Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine located in Chapel Hill; the school 
that his father helped integrate. While at UNC, Dr. Z was honored with 
the MacNider Award, a prize given to sophomores with humility, good 
character, and impeccable personal integrity.
  Dr. Z earned his Doctor of Medicine from UNC in 1985 and returned to 
his hometown to finish his medical training. He completed his residency 
in pediatrics at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore in 1988 and remained in 
Baltimore to begin his own practice. He opened his urgent care 
facility, Life Care Plus, in an area of our city that struggles with 
poor health outcomes and poverty.
  In the decades since he opened Life Care Plus, Dr. Z has been a 
guardian angel to the people of the 21215 ZIP Code. Beyond his 
willingness to practice in an underserved area, what is so remarkable 
about Dr. Z is that he will never turn away a patient because they 
dont have enough money. A pediatrician by trade, he encourages 
patients to bring in their grandparents for free check-ups, and hell 
happily give patients his personal cell phone number to call him any 
time, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.
  Dr. Zs spirit of generosity has turned his clinic into a family 
home, and many of the people he treated as children now bring their own 
kids to the clinic. His incredible value to his community has been 
repeatedly recognized, with Dr. Z receiving awards like the UNC Harvey 
E. Beech Outstanding Alumni Award and the University of Maryland, 
Baltimore Countys Community Leadership Award.
  The love that the people of Baltimore hold for Dr. Z was most clearly 
shown in recent months, as Dr. Z is now dealing with health struggles 
of his own. He was recently diagnosed with renal and colorectal cancer, 
and due to insurance issues, he was facing the possibility of being 
unable to pay his medical bills. When his patients heard, they leapt 
into action to create a GoFundMe which has raised more than $250,000 
from over 3,000 individual donors. As further proof of his virtue, Dr. 
Z made clear that every penny that he doesnt need for his treatment, 
will go directly into his clinic.
, you would be hard-pressed to find another individual 
with as much passion

for healing and love for his community as Dr. Michael Zollicoffer. For 
his kindness, his selflessness, and his God-given abilities, Dr. Z has 
been a pillar of the Baltimore community for decades. His cancer 
prognosis are positive and, God willing, hell be practicing in our 
city for years to come.
I rise today to recognize a remarkable 
constituent from my district, Bertha Mazon, to celebrate her 100th 
birthday.
  On April 5, 1925, Bertha Martinez was born in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
She immigrated to Arizona when she was just 11 months old. After 
graduating from Phoenix Union High School in 1943, she went on to work 
for the Department of Economic Security, starting as an employment 
office manager where she helped countless Arizonans acquire jobs. She 
then went on to be a legislative liaison within the Department for over 
45 years. Berthas guiding mission in this role was to give back to the 
community, which she did through obtaining lost employment checks, food 
stamps, veteran claims, and other benefits. Legislators and 
constituents alike came to know her as ``the Angel of DES.
  Since the 1970s, Bertha provided countless resources for the Valley 
through her involvement in Las Damas del Valle, the oldest Latina 
volunteer organization in Arizona for which Bertha was one of the first 
members. Through this organization, Bertha did door-to-door education 
to eradicate Tuberculosis, supported the local South Phoenix Boy Scout 
troop with supplies, and acted as an auxiliary volunteer for the County 
Hospital before it opened in 1970.
  Bertha devoted her life to creating opportunities for the people of 
Arizona and continues to empower the Latino community through education 
and service. Beyond her career, she is also a skilled painter, once 
earning a recognition that resulted in her work being displayed in the 
U.S. Capitol building. She is also a life-long-learner, an amazing 
cook, and secret comedian with a knack for bilingual jokes.
  As we celebrate this incredible 100 years Bertha has lived, we 
reflect on the many achievements that have shaped her life. Through it 
all, her love for her family has been a constant source of strength and 
joy. Married for over 60 years, she raised 4 children--Mark, Sonja, 
Frankie, and Linda, and her family continues to grow.
  Bertha has also faced profound loss, including the loss of her son 
Frankie when he was just 17. His spirit lives on through the 
generations of the Mazon family. Her deep love for her family and 
support for her community is a constant source of inspiration to all 
who know her.
, please join me in recognizing the many contributions Ms. 
Mazon has provided for our community and celebrate this incredible 
milestone by wishing her a happy 100th birthday.
I rise to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown 
Hero, Thomas Owen. Thomas is a senior at Jesuit College Preparatory 
School in Dallas. With his graduation quickly approaching, instead of 
making the celebration about him, he is organizing a graduation party 
to benefit Make-A-Wish North Texas.
  Thomas serves on the Make-A-Wish Youth Leadership Council, and has 
brought together a team of students from local North Texas high schools 
to help support this cause. He is inspiring others to take action and 
give back to their communities.
  I thank Thomas for inspiring his fellow North Texans through his 
selflessness and leadership. Through the use of his entrepreneurial 
skills, he is making a difference in our community.
I rise today, along with my colleagues 
from Washington state, Representatives Suzan DelBene, Rick Larsen, 
Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Michael Baumgartner, Emily Randall, Pramila 
Jayapal, Kim Schrier, Adam Smith, and Marilyn Strickland, to recognize 
and commend the distinguished tenure of Dr. Kirk Schulz as President of 
Washington State University (WSU). Since 2016, President Schulz has 
guided WSU through a period of immense growth, advancing research, 
student success, and statewide partnerships. As he prepares for 
retirement, we honor his leadership and dedication to higher education 
in Washington State.
  Under President Schulzs tenure, WSU has strengthened its reputation 
as a world-class research institution, addressing critical challenges 
in agriculture, medicine, and clean energy. His efforts have ensured 
that students across our state have access to high-quality education, 
and his work with Washingtons congressional delegation has helped 
secure funding for key university initiatives.
  Each of Washingtons ten congressional districts has benefited from 
President Schulzs leadership, reinforcing WSUs role as an institution 
that serves all Washingtonians. I would like to highlight a few key 
impacts across the state.
  1st District: WSU has built strong partnerships with the regions 
tech industry, working with companies in King and Snohomish counties to 
prepare students for careers in artificial intelligence, software 
development, and semiconductor manufacturing. These efforts ensure 
Washington remains at the forefront of technological advancement.
  2nd District: WSUs agricultural extension programs in Northwest 
Washington have played a vital role in supporting farmers and 
sustaining fisheries in the region. WSUs Everett campus provides 
entrepreneurs critical business management skills and trains engineers 
for the world-class aerospace and high-tech industries in Northwest 
Washington.
  3rd District: WSU Vancouver has expanded opportunities in STEM 
education, creating new pathways for students to enter high-demand 
fields like engineering and healthcare. By connecting with local 
industries and healthcare providers, WSU is strengthening Southwest 
Washingtons workforce and economic outlook.
  4th District: Home to some of the Nations premier vineyards, Central 
Washington has benefited from WSUs viticulture and enology programs. 
Through cutting-edge research and collaboration with winemakers, WSU 
has

helped the region maintain its reputation as a world-class wine 
producer.
  5th District: WSUs Pullman campus is a cornerstone of agricultural 
research, and the completion of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) 
building has only strengthened that legacy. The facility provides 
farmers and food producers with critical innovations in crop science 
and food security, supporting one of Washingtons most essential 
industries.
  6th District: WSU researchers have been at the forefront of 
sustainable forestry and climate resilience efforts. Their work 
supports the health of Washingtons forests, which are vital for the 
economy, outdoor recreation, and the environment, ensuring these 
natural resources are protected for future generations.
  7th District: WSUs collaborations with Seattle-area institutions 
have led to major advancements in medical research, including 
breakthroughs in cancer treatment and biomedical engineering. These 
efforts not only push the boundaries of science but also create 
opportunities for students to engage in life-changing research.
  8th District: With a focus on clean energy, WSU has led the way in 
developing innovative hydroelectric, wind, and solar power solutions. 
These advancements have benefited communities across the Cascades, 
helping Washington transition to a more sustainable energy future.
  9th District: The Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine has provided new 
opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds to enter the 
medical profession. By expanding access to healthcare education, WSU is 
addressing physician shortages and improving healthcare access across 
Washington.
  10th District: Military families near Joint Base Lewis-McChord have 
benefited from WSUs extension programs, which provide educational 
support and workforce development opportunities. These initiatives 
ensure that service members and their families have access to the 
resources they need to succeed.
, as President Schulz concludes his tenure, we recognize 
his transformative impact on Washington State University and our 
communities. His leadership has strengthened WSUs role as a center of 
innovation, education, and economic opportunity.
  I thank President Schulz for his years of service, and I look forward 
to seeing how WSU continues to grow and thrive in the years to come.
I rise today to honor the life, service, 
and memory of Officer Osmar Rodarte, a dedicated law enforcement 
officer, a U.S. Army veteran, and a loving husband and father. Officer 
Rodarte made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty while serving 
with the Marysville Police Department, tragically taken from us at just 
27 years old.
  Osmar Rodarte was a proud graduate of Rio Linda High School, Class of 
2016. He answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the 
United States Army before returning home to continue that service in 
law enforcement. As an officer with the Marysville Police Department, 
he was known for his dedication, professionalism, and commitment to 
keeping people safe.
  On the day he was taken from us, Officer Rodarte was participating in 
a multi-agency operation targeting transnational drug trafficking 
organizations, work that is critical in keeping our streets safe from 
the influence of dangerous criminals. His sacrifice is a reminder of 
the risks our law enforcement officers take every day to protect the 
people they serve.
  Officer Rodarte was more than a public servant. He was a father, a 
husband, a brother, and a friend. His fellow officers described him as 
a true hero, and those who knew him best spoke of his unwavering 
dedication to his family and loved ones. In the aftermath of this 
tragic loss, the people of Marysville, Rio Linda, and the entire North 
State have come together in mourning, offering prayers and support to 
his family.
  Osmar leaves behind a wife and child who now face an unimaginable 
loss. No words can fully ease their grief, but we must ensure that 
Officer Rodartes sacrifice isnt forgotten. His service, both in 
uniform and in his everyday life, is a testament to his character and 
his deep sense of duty.
  We honor Officer Rodartes bravery, his service, and his legacy. Our 
prayers are with his family, his fellow officers, and all who knew him. 
May he rest in eternal peace. God bless him.
I rise to honor the Vietnam and Korean War 
veterans who traveled to Washington, D.C. on April 9, 2025, with Honor 
Flight Chicago, a program that provides WWII, Vietnam, and Korean War 
veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials

on The National Mall in Washington, D.C. These memorials were built to 
honor their courage and service to their country.
  The American Veteran is one of our greatest treasures. The Soldiers, 
Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled here on 
April 9 answered our Nations call to service during one of its 
greatest times of need. From the Pacific Asian Theatre to the Korean 
Theater, these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave service, and 
sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a hero. We owe 
them more gratitude than can ever be expressed.
  I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials. 
I am proud to include in the Record the names of these men and women 
for all to see, hear, and recognize, and I call on my colleagues to 
rise and join me in expressing gratitude:
