I rise to celebrate the life and 
advocacy of Malphine ``Mafa Fogel, who will celebrate her 95th 
birthday on March 11, 2024.
  Malphine was born and raised in Bradys Bend, Pennsylvania. After 
graduating as the valedictorian of East Brady High Schools class of 
1947, she moved to Butler, Pennsylvania. She began a successful career 
there with the Butler Eagle newspaper and Nationwide Insurance Company. 
In 1957, Malphine married Maurice ``Cubby Fogel and shared 57 happy 
years of marriage before his passing in 2014. The couple raised three 
children together: Mary, Marc, and Anne. Over the years, the Fogel 
family grew to include nine grandchildren and eight great-
grandchildren. She also remains closely connected with her seven 
siblings and travels home to Bradys Bend every Sunday to spend dinner 
with them.
  Last May, I had the honor of meeting Malphine for the first time when 
she traveled to Washington and advocated for her sons release from a 
Russian prison. With the support of Malphine and her family, I proudly 
introduced the Marc Fogel Act to provide transparency into the State 
Departments wrongful detainment determination process and ensure that 
Americans imprisoned overseas are not forgotten. The Fogel family 
deserves answers, and we will not rest until Marc returns home.
  Malphine built her life on the bedrock of faith and reverence for 
God, and it continues to guide her through this difficult time. Every 
Sunday, she attends Mass at St. Michael the Archangel and was a 
frequent parishioner at the 24 hour Eucharistic Adoration for 20 years. 
Her example of faith, love, and devotion to family provide an inspiring 
example for all Americans.
, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvanias 14th 
Congressional District, I wish Malphine a happy 95th birthday and 
express my urgent, longstanding hope for her sons release so that the 
Fogel family can be swiftly reunited.
I rise today to commemorate the 
distinguished career and contributions of J. Brent Olmstead, a fourth 
generation Idahoan raised on a cattle ranch with a rich background in 
public policy and advocacy.
  Brent grew up on a cattle ranch south of Twin Falls, Idaho, and 
dedicated over 35

years of his life to public service. He began his career as a lobbyist 
for Idaho Commerce and Industry in 1994. There he focused his attention 
and expertise on issues such as agriculture, natural resources, 
immigration, and the environment.
  After 7 years at IACI, where he served as vice-president. Brent then 
created his own consulting firm named MPIdaho. As a consultant, Brent 
specialized in public policy development and strategic planning for 
private businesses in agriculture, taxation, and immigration. He also 
created the non-profit organization, Milk Producers of Idaho.
  More recently, Brent joined the University of Idahos College of 
Agricultural and Life Sciences, as assistant dean for government and 
external relations. In this capacity, Brent worked extensively on a 
project called the Idaho Center for Agriculture, Food, and the 
Environment (CAFE). The new center will focus their research on 
critical problems that agribusiness faces.
  Brent also received IACIs 2023 Pat K. Harwood award, in recognition 
of his decades of service to the state of Idaho. A great achievement 
for a man who exemplifies what it means to be a leader.
  His commitment to Idaho is also evident through his service on 
various boards, including the advisory board for the James A. and 
Louise McLure Center for Public Policy Research, the Idaho Hispanic 
Foundation, the Idaho Small Business Advisory Council, the Childrens 
Discovery Center of Idaho, and Idaho Red Cross.
  My friend, Brent Olmstead, has had many titles in his distinguished 
career, but the two most important to Brent are father and husband. 
Brent is a devoted family man and raised five children with his late 
wife, Jane Wittmeyer.
  If anyone has earned the right to have a peaceful and enjoyable 
retirement, it is Brent. Well done my friend and congratulations.

I was saddened by the recent and 
sudden passing of Tammy Holland, who was an anchor in the Ogden, Utah 
and Hill Air Force Base communities. Tammy was a native to Colorado, 
where she grew up hiking, skiing, and riding horses. She brought her 
love of the outdoors to Utah and instilled the same admiration for 
Gods creations in her children, Andrew and Avery. Tammy was easy to be 
around and quick to welcome anyone as a new friend. With her husband of 
23 years, Tammy built her home centered on faith in Jesus Christ and 
encouraged family and friends alike to join her in serving others.
  Its no easy task raising two kids in an Air Force family, and Tammy 
was a rock for her husband and children as they made homes in Florida, 
South Carolina, Ohio, Germany, Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, 
Illinois, Missouri, and ultimately, Utah. Friends and loved ones in 
each of these communities came to love Tammy for her organizing and 
compassionate service to the Airmen and their respective families. Our 
community is better because of her efforts and her influence will be 
greatly missed. It is upon us to carry forward her legacy of service.
  I extend my deepest sympathy to Tammys husband, Col. Jeff Holland, 
and their son, Andrew, and daughter, Avery, for their loss, and I offer 
my prayers on their behalf.
HON. HENRY C. ``HANK JOHNSON, JR.
I rise today to honor Mr. Daniel 
A. Moore, Sr. of Stone Mountain, Georgia, who passed away on March 4, 
2024.
  Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 20, 1935, Mr. Moore 
found his true calling in film. After moving to Atlanta in the 1970s, 
he quickly became a key figure in the Citys burgeoning cultural scene. 
A tireless entrepreneur, filmmaker, producer, writer, cinematographer, 
editor, exhibition designer, photographer, author, and humanitarian, 
a man of immense talent and his renowned works in film, 
music, and literature helped shape our culture in Atlanta and beyond.
  In 1978, Mr. Moore embarked upon one of his greatest gifts when he 
founded the African American Panoramic Experience (APEX) Museum, where 
he proudly served as its President until his passing. The APEX Museum 
is the oldest Black history museum in Atlanta and a cultural 
institution. His work will live on as the museum plans APEX Phase II, a 
massive 90,000 square foot expansion that will provide a state-of-the-
art walk-through history, from African civilizations to contemporary 
Black America.
  Among his many awards and accolades, Mr. Moore received the Joseph R. 
Biden Presidential Lifetime Achievement Award on October 21, 2023. Most 
recently, during Black History Month this year, I had the pleasure of 
recognizing Mr. Moore for his pioneering contributions to the 
preservation and showcasing of Black history and culture in Atlanta at 
a ceremony in Stonecrest.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the outstanding life and 
legacy that Mr. Moore leaves behind for generations to come.
I rise today in support of H.R. 
1240, the Winnebago Land Transfer Act, introduced by my colleague, Mr. 
Feenstra from Iowa. This critical bill would transfer rightfully-owed 
land back to the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska. The land in question was 
taken from the Tribe in an illegal acquisition, and due to complex 
legal stipulations within the most recent court proceedings

pertaining to this matter, the land has still not been returned to the 
Tribe. Legal complications of these sorts when it comes to federal 
tribal trust responsibility are an all-too-common phenomenon for Indian 
Country and demonstrates the importance of a strong relationship 
between the federal government and tribes. This bill would reinstate 
the autonomy of the land back to the Winnebago Tribe and protect their 
sovereignty. The state of Iowa, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and 
two affected counties are supportive of this bill, and have 
demonstrated their support for this cause. I applaud my colleagues who 
have moved swiftly to pass this bill.
I was back in my district for Primary 
election night. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call 
No. 60 and YEA on Roll Call No. 61.

today I rise to recognize the Santa Rosa 
County Teacher of the Year, Mrs. Christal Bennett, for her exceptional 
efforts in fostering the musical talents of her many students. A
