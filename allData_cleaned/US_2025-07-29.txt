I rise today to the 
following comprehensive history of Browntown, and to include in the 
Record in perpetuity.

       In what is known as Browntown, near present-day Snow Hill, 
     located in Greene County, North Carolina, centuries of human 
     presence, resilience, and cultural exchange have shaped the 
     land. Long before Europeans or Africans arrived, the 
     Tuscarora Nation, part of the Iroquoian speaking people, 
     inhabited this region as early as the late 15th and 16th 
     centuries, establishing an Indigenous cultural and 
     agricultural presence along the Contentnea Creek and its 
     trade areas. By the time of European contact in the late 
     1600s, explorers such as John Lederer had passed through and 
     began to map the area. Followed by John Lawson, whose 
     writings in the early 1700s documented the complexity of 
     community life and culture among the Tuscarora living within 
     the lands boundaries.
       Although Greene County, originally named Glasgow County 
     formally established in 1791 and renamed Greene County in 
     1799, its origins were deeply entwined with those of the 
     Tuscarora stronghold of Cotechney, located near what would 
     later become the county seat. As settlers arrived in the 
     early 18th century, they interwove their lives with those of 
     Native Tuscarora through conflict, cooperation, and kinship. 
     The town of Snow Hill, founded in 1828, emerged later in 
     Greene County.
       Yet, beyond these chartered towns and official records, a 
     different legacy took shape: one of kinship ties, spiritual 
     traditions, and cultural memory of the rural settlement that 
     became known as Browntown. Never incorporated, Browntown 
     emerged as a self-sustaining community built on shared land, 
     interwoven ancestry, and mutual survival. Its roots reflect a 
     unique blend of African, Tuscarora, and European heritage, 
     forming a tri-racial community whose resilience and cultural 
     impact continue to shape Greene Countys identity to this 
     day.
       Browntown lies along ancient Native American trade routes 
     and waterways, connecting to Contentnea Creek, located just 
     south at a distance of 2-3 miles, and near the Neuse River, 
     approximately 7-10 miles away. Browntown took form as a 
     significant settlement and hunting area for the Tuscarora, 
     located less than 10 miles away from the final, most decisive 
     battle of the Tuscarora War in 1713 at Fort Neoheroka. 
     Browntown is also home to several blended cemeteries, 
     including at least one known unmarked Indigenous burial 
     ground, as well as unmarked slave graves and colonial and 
     antebellum burial sites. The presence of these sacred sites, 
     ranging from Native burial grounds to unmarked family plots 
     and church cemeteries, reflects the deeply intertwined 
     histories of the people who once lived and blended on this 
     land.
       Browntown also sits near the intersection of North Carolina 
     Highways 11 and 13, which connect to Indian Woods to the 
     North in Bertie County. Indian Woods was the Tuscarora 
     Reservation established in 1717 after the Tuscarora War, 
     which also contained blended people. Essential highways, such 
     as Routes 58 and 70, once served as key routes for both 
     Indigenous nations, like the Tuscarora, and later colonial 
     settlers. Browntown runs parallel to Highway 258, a route 
     constructed initially by the British for trade between 
     Eastern NC and Southeast Virginia. It is where the 
     descendants of tri-racial communities continue to live, such 
     as those in the Winton Triangle of Hertford County. These 
     trading paths were and still are conduits for agricultural 
     exchange, tribal passageways, and rural resettlement areas 
     before and after emancipation.

       Browntown in modern times has been a part of Hookerton 
     Township, which lies within a deeply historical corridor that 
     connects the lived experiences of tri-racial descendants 
     throughout eastern North Carolina. The Browntown Community 
     stands as a living testament to the enduring spirit of people 
     of tri-racial heritage. Forged not by municipal charter but 
     by the shared tenacity of descendants from African, European, 
     and Tuscarora people of rural eastern North Carolina.
       Browntowns legacy is one of resilience and unity. 
     Established as a free, autonomous, and safe haven before and 
     after the Civil War, it was home to pioneers of land 
     stewardship and mutual aid, all woven together by distinct 
     cultures into a thriving, mixed-rural community. The 
     Browntown community is also not far from Wheat Swamp, as the 
     wooded wetlands offered natural seclusion for worship and 
     reflection during antebellum times. This uncharted 
     settlement, born outside the boundaries of conventional 
     towns, cultivated a unique social fabric that honored mixed 
     people while cherishing common purpose.

       Before the formalization of land deeds and property 
     holdings in Browntown, the people came together to worship. 
     Although not located in Browntown, Shady Grove Church is 
     closely linked to the communitys history and identity, as it 
     was the first organized church established nearby as a place 
     of worship near Hookerton Town in Greene County. Shady Grove 
     Church is the oldest known church serving people of mixed 
     race in the community, established in 1867 as a bush shelter 
     (a bush arbor) made of leaves and branches to offer shade 
     during worship. Considered the mother church, Shady Grove 
     gave rise to several churches, reflecting its profound 
     spiritual influence.
       The founding landowners Ellis Dixon, Ellis Suggs, Lewis 
     Dunn, Squire Turnage, and Ephraim Dixon laid the groundwork 
     for faith-based resilience in post-Civil War Greene County. 
     It is located approximately 6 to 9 miles from Browntown. 
     Shady Grove church represents the early roots of communal 
     worship that would later continue within Browntown itself 
     through Brown Chapel, Oak Grove, McCoys Chapel Church, and 
     other churches in the community. Established in 1899 and 
     formally deeded by Richard Brown in 1918. The creation of 
     this church further cemented the communitys spiritual 
     legacy. As a central landholder and patriarch of the 
     Browntown community, by deeded land ``for church purposes 
     only to the United America Free Will Baptist Church, Brown 
     Chapel, later known as Brown Chapel. This land, situated 
     along the public road from Browns Crossroads to Glenfield 
     Road and near the cemetery road, served as sacred ground for 
     religious practices, fellowship, and ancestral remembrance. 
     The deed signed and witnessed on February 28, 1918, 
     represents one of the earliest documented acts of faith-based 
     land transfer by a mixed landowner in the county, reinforcing 
     the continuity of spiritual life that began at Shady Grove 
     and anchoring a new generation of worship in Browntowns 
     evolving identity.
       Additionally, Browntown School served as an educational 
     center for generations of children in this rural tri-racial 
     community. Though no longer standing, the schools memory 
     lives on through oral history and preserved photographs. Its 
     foundation may remain buried on the original site, offering 
     future potential for archaeological or cultural recovery. 
     Browntown School was more than a building; it represented 
     self-determination, literacy, and intergenerational legacy 
     during a time when rural education for African American and 
     mixed, heritage children was underfunded and overlooked by 
     formal systems. Its presence reinforces the longstanding 
     footprint of Browntown residents in shaping Greene Countys 
     educational and civic landscape.

       A living testament to the complexity of North Carolinas 
     and Americas rural past, it includes Richard Brown, a 
     cornerstone figure in Browntowns development. Born in 1852, 
     to formerly enslaved or free parents, after living through 
     Emancipation and Reconstruction, a photograph taken of him 
     highlights a prominent figure. It captures not just his face 
     but also his determination. Born just before the Civil War, 
     Richard would raise a family amid the struggles of 
     Reconstruction and segregation, passing on values of land 
     stewardship and kinship.
       His daughter, Annie Jane Jones (1884-1950), and her 
     marriage to John C. Grant (1878-1936), represent the enduring 
     lineage that remained on the land. Browntown stood as a 
     sanctuary for those born of blended lineages, offering 
     dignity where societal bonds of rigid racial hierarchies were 
     enduring. Historical records document Browntowns origins, at 
     least, as far back as 1880. A warranty deed executed in 1887 
     by Chappel H. Churchill and M.E. Churchill, transferring land 
     in Hookerton Township to William Brown, born in 1874, an 
     African American landowner

     whose wife, Addie Grant Brown, born in 1881, to Needham 
     Grant, 1845, of mixed ancestry, symbolizes remarkable self-
     determination during the post-Reconstruction era.
       The records for Greene County confirm that members of the 
     Brown family legally held property in the area now known as 
     Browntown. This deed serves as tangible evidence of 
     landownership by a mixed, heritage family during an era when 
     such claims were not only rare but often met with resistance. 
     Unlike chartered townships, Browntown emerged as a self-
     defined community operating outside formal governance but 
     deeply rooted in traditions of kinship, survival, and 
     cultural unity. The legal documentation, when paired with 
     oral histories passed down through generations, affirms that 
     Browntown was not a place imagined but a living, land-based 
     community that sustained itself through shared heritage, 
     mutual protection, and pride in place.

       The Browntown Annual Community Picnic is a living act of 
     preservation. For over 300 years, people and families of 
     Tuscarora, African, and European descent have lived in this 
     community in Greene County. The people return to honor their 
     lineages, which shaped a rural community that continues to 
     unite in celebration of a shared heritage, family ties, and 
     collective memory. Preserving traditional foods, stories, and 
     customs that contribute to the culture of Greene County and 
     the State of North Carolina, the Annual Community Picnic is a 
     living tradition that stands as both a homecoming and a 
     cultural archive. This gathering is more than a reunion; it 
     is an act of generational memory, where traditional foods, 
     stories, and customs are passed down under the shade of 
     longleaf pines. Generations in Browntown have thrived by 
     blending traditions, celebrating lived experiences, and 
     fostering a sense of belonging that transcends historical 
     significance.

today, the 12th Congressional District 
recognizes the life and contributions of remarkable resident Lizzie 
Toles, as she turns 100 years old. We congratulate her on decades of 
community work that has had a lasting impact on our community.
  Lizzies roots started in Mississippi, where she was born. She moved 
to Detroit in 1952, eager to work and make our communities a better 
place. When she worked at a local nursing home, people always loved her 
smile and conversations that brought so much warmth and comfort to 
every person she met. Mother Lizzie has three children--James, 
Patricia, and Jerry--and has five grandchildren and several great-
grandchildren.
  Apart from her career and family, Lizzie has remained an active 
member of the community through her participation in water aerobics, 
bowling, and the Derrick Memorial Missionary Baptist Church. She loves 
her garden, and her home is surrounded by beautiful flowers, which 
reflect her love for nature. Join me in celebrating Ms. Lizzie on 100 
years of life.
today, I want to recognize Mother Regina Rose 
Edwards on her 90th birthday. We honor her life of dedication to 
service, mentorship, and spiritual leadership in Michigans 12th 
Congressional District.
  Mother Edwards served her community in the Michigan Southwest First 
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the Church of God in Christ through 
three successive administrations as Jurisdictional Supervisor of Women 
for the Michigan Southwest First. In her role, she has exemplified 
strength, leadership and a spirit of generosity. Through her position, 
she has transformed lives across generations, building bridges between

  The 12th Congressional District honors Mother Edwards for her 
commitment to faith and service in celebration of her 90th birthday. I 
thank her for her lifetime of wisdom, guidance and her remarkable 
influence on our community and district.
it is my special privilege to recognize and 
honor Delta Air Lines as they celebrate their centennial anniversary.
  Delta Air Lines was founded on March 2, 1925, as Huff Daland Dusters, 
the worlds first aerial crop-dusting company in Georgia. Huff Dalands 
fleet of 18 planes became one of the largest privately owned fleets in 
the crop-dusting business.
  In 1928, Huff Daland Dusters was renamed Delta Air Service to reflect 
the Mississippi Delta region it served, and by the following year, the 
airlines first passenger flight took off from Dallas, Texas. By 1945, 
the company accrued more than 300 million passenger miles and formally 
became Delta Air Lines.
  From its humble beginnings, Delta has evolved into one of the worlds 
leading airlines, transforming the way we travel. Today, Delta has over 
4,000 daily flights to more than 280 destinations. Delta currently 
employs a team of 100,000 people, including over 4,750 Michigan-based 
employees.
  Since establishing Detroit Metropolitan Airport as one of its major 
hubs, Delta has transformed Michigan into a gateway to the world.

From connecting local businesses to global markets to reuniting 
families across time zones, Delta has played a crucial role in shaping 
Michigans modern identity.
  Through innovation, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to 
safety and service, Delta has continuously redefined the air travel 
experience.
  As we look to the skies, we celebrate Delta Air Lines for becoming 
the first U.S. airline to reach this milestone, and we wish them the 
best of luck as they continue to soar to new heights.
I rise to recognize and commend The Claremont 
Colleges on their 100th Anniversary. I include in the Record the 
following Proclamation:

       Whereas, on October 14, 1925, The Claremont Colleges were 
     founded with the vision of creating a unique consortium of 
     world-class institutions rooted in academic excellence, 
     interdisciplinary collaboration, and a shared commitment to 
     the liberal arts and sciences: and
       Whereas, for 100 years, The Claremont Colleges have 
     contributed immeasurably to the intellectual, cultural, and 
     civic life of California, the nation, and the world through 
     the education of generations of students, groundbreaking 
     research, and public service; and
       Whereas, the consortium, comprising five undergraduate 
     colleges and two graduate institutions, exemplifies the 
     values of innovation; freedom of thought and expression; a

     liberal arts foundation combined with specialized and 
     practical training; high academic standards; and a diverse 
     and inclusive community that provides students with broad 
     academic resources while preserving the intimacy of small 
     college environments; and
       Whereas, The Claremont Colleges have been a vital part of 
     the Claremont and Southern California region, supporting the 
     local economy, partnering with civic organizations, 
     supporting community organizations, and serving as a hub for 
     cultural enrichment, discourse, and discovery; and
       Whereas, the 100th anniversary of The Claremont Colleges is 
     a moment to honor the legacy of its founders, celebrate a 
     century of achievement, and inspire future generations to 
     uphold the principles of academic inquiry, leadership, and 
     service;
       Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Congresswoman Judy 
     Chu, representing Californias 28th Congressional District, 
     do hereby recognize and commend The Claremont Colleges on the 
     occasion of their 100th Anniversary, and extend sincere 
     appreciation for their enduring contributions to the people 
     of California and beyond.
The 12th Congressional District recognizes 
and honors Battalion Chief Ryan Phipps of the Dearborn Fire Department

firefighters, Battalion Chief Phipps exemplifies the heart of public 
service. I thank him for his decades of sacrifice and leadership and 
wish him well in his retirement.
today, I want to recognize Caribbean American 
Heritage Month, and celebrate the culture, contributions, and history 
of Caribbean Americans in Michigans 12th Congressional District and 
across our Nation.
  National Caribbean American Heritage Month, first recognized in 2005, 
was established after years of global efforts to spotlight Caribbean 
Americans vibrant culture and contributions to our country. Caribbean 
Community Services, a nonprofit organization based in Detroit, 
Michigan, has done an outstanding job of uplifting Caribbean history. 
Through their engaging events, they celebrate the rich cultural

and the 12th Congressional District.
I rise today to recognize the retirement of 
Colonel Chad W. Caldwell after a distinguished career with the United 
States Army of Engineers and over 25 years of service to our Nation.
  Colonel Caldwell most recently served as Commander of the Sacramento 
District, South Pacific Division. A graduate of West Point, he holds 
advanced degrees in structural and civil engineering and has served in 
key command and academic roles both stateside and overseas.
  Throughout his career, Colonel Caldwell exemplified integrity, 
discipline, and excellence. He began his service in 1999, first 
assigned to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and went on to hold a variety 
of leadership positions, including company commander in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and as the first commander of the 5th Brigade Engineer 
Battalion at Fort Carson. His leadership helped strengthen our national 
defense and bolster critical infrastructure in California and beyond. 
His influence will be felt for years to come through the projects he 
led and the soldiers he mentored.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Colonel Chad 
W. Caldwell for his years of faithful service and in wishing him and 
his family all the best in this new chapter of life.
I rise today to honor the 
life and legacy of an extraordinary Mississippian, a dedicated 
educator, civil rights advocate, and public servant--Mrs. Ellie J. 
Dahmer, who is celebrating her 100th birthday.
F. Dahmer, Sr., a civil 
rights icon who gave his life in the pursuit of voting rights for 
African Americans. Together, they formed a powerful partnership that 
challenged the injustices of the Jim Crow South. When their home was 
firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1966, Mrs. Dahmers courage and quick 
thinking saved her family. In the years that followed, she not only 
rebuilt her life, but continued the work she and her husband began--
ensuring that all Mississippians had access to the ballot box.
  After her husbands murder, Mrs. Dahmer worked tirelessly to support 
her family, maintain their farm, and provide for the community. She 
went on to serve with distinction as the District 2 Election 
Commissioner in Forrest County for 12 years. Her quiet strength and 
tireless advocacy played a critical role in the fight for justice, 
culminating decades later in the long-overdue conviction of her 
husbands killer.
, On behalf of Mississippis Second Congressional District 
and a grateful Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mrs. 
Ellie J. Dahmer for a century of unwavering commitment to justice, 
education, and democracy. Mrs. Ellie J. Dahmer is a living symbol of 
strength, sacrifice, and service. Her 100th birthday is not just a 
celebration of longevity--it is a celebration of a life that has left a 
permanent mark on the conscience of this country.
HONORING FABIAN I. VALENTINS SERVICE TO THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND 
                             of mississippi
I rise today to honor a 
valued member of my staff, Fabian I. Valentin, who is departing the 
Committee on Homeland Security to begin his graduate studies at 
Princeton University and commence a fellowship program.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT ESSIE DELL OBRYANT WOODS AND THE 6888TH 
                              of michigan
today the 12th Congressional District proudly 
recognizes Staff Sergeant Essie Dell OBryant Woods, a lifelong 
Detroiter and courageous member of the historic 6888th Central Postal 
Directory Battalion.
  Known as the ``Six Triple Eight, this all-Black, all women unit 
served under grueling conditions during World War II, sorting over 
65,000 pieces of mail per shift to boost troop morale across Europe. 
Despite facing racism and poor living conditions, Staff Sergeant Woods 
and her battalion cleared a six-month mail backlog in just three 
months. She earned numerous medals for her service and continued 
supporting fellow veterans for over 35 years, co-founding the National 
Association of Black Military Women and the Wolverine Chapter of the 
WAC Veterans Association.
  Sergeant Essie Dell OBryant Woods induction into the Michigan 
Military and Veterans Hall of Honor is a powerful reminder of her 
legacy and the trailblazing bravery of the 6888th.
today, the 12th Congressional District honors 
the life and legacy of Commissioner Irma Clark-Coleman, a tireless 
champion for the people of Detroit and Wayne County. From the Detroit 
Board of Education to the Michigan Legislature, the NAACP, and the 
Wayne County Commission, Irma dedicated over six decades to public 
service and uplifting her community. She was a fierce advocate for 
children, seniors, and working families, always centering justice, 
equity, and compassion in her work.
  Commissioner Clark-Coleman was the first in her family to graduate 
college, blazing trails for Black women in leadership. Whether serving 
holiday meals to our community, helping others, or advancing housing 
justice, she did so with unmatched grace and conviction.
  Her legacy will live on in every life she touched. My deepest 
condolences go out to her family, including her husband, Rev. Ron D. 
Coleman. Sr., her two children, her grandchildren, and her loved ones. 
We mourn her passing, celebrate her 88 years of life, and remember her 
deep commitment to public service. May her memory continue to guide us 
toward a more just and loving future.
today, I introduce the District of Columbia 
National Guard Commanding General Residency Act, which would require 
the Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard to 
reside in D.C. Two Congresses ago, the House Committee on Oversight and 
Reform passed this bill.
  The president controls the D.C. National Guard. In contrast, 
governors of the states and the three territories that have National 
Guards each control their National Guards.
  The Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard is the top official 
in the D.C. National Guard, is appointed by the president and is a 
federal employee. There are residency requirements for government 
officials in federal law, D.C. law and the laws of jurisdictions 
throughout the country. In fact, several states have laws that require 
the top official in their National Guard to reside in the state, and it 
is highly likely that every state and territory only appoints residents 
as the top official in their National Guard. The primary reason 
residency requirements exist is so that government officials have a 
connection to the residents they serve and knowledge of the unique 
issues and challenges faced by residents.
  Congress has justifiably required certain federal officials to reside 
in the jurisdiction to which they are appointed, including U.S. 
district court judges, U.S. Marshals and U.S. Attorneys. Similarly, 
Congress, which controls the local D.C. court system, has justifiably 
required local D.C. judges and members of the D.C. Judicial Nomination 
Commission and the D.C. Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure 
to reside in D.C.
  There is no reason that the Commanding General of the D.C. National 
Guard, a federal entity that serves D.C. residents and that has both a 
military and law enforcement role, should not be required to reside in 
D.C. A D.C. residency requirement for the Commanding General of the 
D.C. National Guard will lead to a better relationship between the D.C. 
National Guard and D.C. residents and is a matter of fairness for D.C. 
residents.
  The D.C. mayor should control the D.C. National Guard. Until then, I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill.
today I pay tribute to Jan Setnor, MSN, 
CRNA, Col. (Ret), USAFR, NC. Ms. Setnor will soon complete her year as 
national president of the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology 
(AANA). I am proud that Ms. Setnor was elected as the 2024 to 2025 
president of this prestigious healthcare organization.
  Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) are advanced practice 
registered nurses who administer more than 50 million anesthetics to 
patients each year. They work in every setting in which anesthesia is 
delivered including hospital surgical suites, obstetrical delivery 
rooms, ambulatory surgical centers, and the offices of dentists, 
podiatrists, and specialty surgeons. They also provide acute and 
chronic pain management services to patients in need of such care. 
CRNAs provide anesthesia for all types of surgical cases and are the 
sole anesthesia providers in many rural hospitals. CRNAs have full 
practice authority in the Army, Navy, and Air Force and are the 
predominant provider of anesthesia on forward surgical teams and in 
combat support hospitals.
  As an AANA member since 1996, Ms. Setnor has contributed greatly to 
the healthcare community nationwide. She has held numerous state and 
national nurse anesthesiology leadership positions, including previous 
service on the AANA Board of Directors as President-Elect, Vice-
President and, Director (as well as two terms as president of the 
Virginia Association of Nurse Anesthetists (VANA)). Her extensive 
involvement with the AANA includes roles as the Association of Veterans 
Affairs Nurse Anesthetists AANA Liaison, Professional Development 
Chair, and participation in various committees, including Political 
Action and Communications.
  She served in the United States Air Force Reserve, retiring with 26 
years of honorable service. Setnors roles included Flight Nurse 
Instructor/Evaluator, CRNA, and senior staff member for the Air Force 
Surgeon General. Notably, she served in Afghanistan as both the 
Anesthesia Team Lead in the largest in-country medical facility and as 
the sole anesthesia provider at a Special Forces Forward Operating 
Base.
  In addition to her work with the AANA and VANA, Setnor has 
contributed to the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care 
as a member of the Governance Unit-Standards Development Committee and 
served as the CRNA Advisor to the Virginia Board of Nursings Committee 
of the Joint Board of Medicine and Nursing.
, Virginia.
  During her AANA presidency, Ms, Setnor has been a prominent advocate 
for the patients and practice of nurse anesthesia before federal 
agencies and members of Congress. She has worked tirelessly to promote 
anesthesia patient safety and the value of CRNAs to our healthcare 
system. Ms. Setnor has advocated to eliminate burdensome regulations 
for CRNAs, to have CRNAs recognized as full practice providers in the 
Veterans Health Administration, and to address underlying causes of 
surprise billing such as provider discrimination.
  I extend my sincere congratulations to Ms. Setnor today on a job well 
done. Her service to AANA and her commitment to safe, quality 
anesthesia care nationwide, are highly commendable. I ask my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing Ms. Setnors notable career and outstanding 
achievements.
