CAPTAIN MICHELLE WILTROUT NAMED OHIOS 13TH DISTRICT CHAMPION OF THE 
                                  WEEK

Wiltrout, who retired this year from the Summit County Sheriffs 
Office, as this weeks Champion of the Week for Ohios 13th 
Congressional District.
  For 32 years, Captain Wiltrout, dedicated her career to serving and 
protecting the people of Summit County in a wide range of roles. Her

a State of Ohio Narcotics Taskforce, making her the first woman to run 
a Narcotics Taskforce in the State of Ohio.

the first woman to receive this honor in the State of Ohio.
  While in charge of the Drug Unit, Captain Wiltrout introduced new 
tools such as drone technology, and expanded the countys K9 unit from 
one dog to eight.
  Again, I want to thank Captain Michelle Wiltrout for her 
distinguished career serving our community, and congratulate her on 
being this weeks Champion of the Week.
I am pleased to congratulate Adam Kingston 
of Manheim Township on winning a gold medal in the Class 3A 3,200-meter 
run at the PIAA track and field championship on May 24.
  The 2025 PIAA Class 3A track and field championship saw students from 
across Pennsylvanias 11th Congressional District excel, but it was 
Manheim Township senior Adam Kingston who took home the gold. Kingston 
maintained the lead for the entire 3,200-meter race and crossed the 
finish line with a time of 8:51:25, a Lancaster-Lebanon League record.
  Kingstons state title finishes a storied career at Manheim Township. 
He was also a part of Manheim Townships 4x800 relay team, alongside 
Andrew Kemper, Ethan Peffley, and Cole Stevens, which won fourth place 
later that day.
  With his gold medal in the Class 3A 3,200-meter run, Kingston 
solidified himself as one of Pennsylvanias best track and field 
athletes. I sincerely congratulate Adam on his success this year and 
wish him well in his athletic and academic endeavors at Penn State 
University.
Clark joined the Boy Scouts in March of 
2019 and quickly achieved the rank of Tenderfoot before climbing the 
ranks to Star Scout, Life Scout, and finally, Eagle Scout. He has held 
a number of leadership positions including Assistant Patrol Leader, 
Patrol Leader, and most recently, Junior Assistant Scoutmaster. He 
earned an extraordinary 40 Merit badges, showing his strong passion to 
the Scout Oath and Law. His marksmanship skills were especially 
outstanding, earning him high honors in both Rifle Shooting and Shotgun 
Shooting. For his Eagle Scout project, Clark created a beautiful garden 
area on the grounds of Saint Gianna Parish, giving church members and 
visitors a peaceful place for reflection. His parents, Chris and Paige, 
are very proud of him, just as I am, and we all look forward to the 
great things Clark will do in college and the years after. God bless 
Clark and God bless our United States of America.
I rise today to celebrate a 
remarkable establishment on Chicagos iconic lakefront, Pier 31 
Chicago, and its visionary founder, Ms. Nikki Hayes.
  Approximately 12 years ago, Ms. Hayes embarked on an extraordinary 
entrepreneurial journey, establishing Pier 31. This venue stands as a 
testament to her pioneering spirit, making it the only female and 
Black-owned restaurant, bar, and entertainment venue on the entire

I rise today to celebrate the 
entrepreneurial spirit and community impact of Ms. Toni Taylor and Ms. 
Malkah Taylor, the visionary owners of The Wrap Bar, a beloved culinary

dedication these women have exemplified plays a crucial role that

impact of Black women-owned businesses.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ms. 
Toni Taylor and Ms. Malkah Taylor for their outstanding contribution 
for our community. May their success continue to inspire us all.
I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents on the Helene Small 
Business Recovery Act, tax cuts, and beneficial ownership reporting.

       Dear Friend,
       Communities throughout Western North Carolina are 
     continuing to pick up the pieces to rebuild after the worst 
     natural disaster to ever hit our mountains made landfall on 
     September 27, 2024. This includes our districts small 
     businesses, which were hit particularly hard due to the loss 
     in tourism following the disaster.
       Small businesses are the lifeblood of WNCs tourism economy 
     and many of them were left suffering from Helenes 
     destruction. Thus, federal support is vital to helping folks 
     rebuild their livelihoods and the regions economy.
       Thats why I introduced the Helene Small Business Recovery 
     Act to facilitate small business owners access to federal 
     aid for rebuilding after Hurricane Helene. This bill 
     clarifies that Small Business Administration loans and 
     federal grants, like those that will be offered through the 
     CDBG-DR program, are not duplicative. Without this 
     clarification, businesses that took an SBA loan to keep 
     themselves afloat would be prohibited from accessing federal 
     grant money when it becomes available.
       Loans and grants are inherently different, and my bill will 
     allow small business owners to access both federal resources 
     so that WNC, and every small business that makes our 
     mountains such a great place to live, has the resources 
     needed to recover.
       Relieving the tax burden for hard-working Americans:
       Americans are benefitting from lower taxes because of the 
     tax cuts that President Trump implemented during his first 
     term.
       However, the tax relief secured in the 2017 Tax Cuts and 
     Jobs Act (TCJA) is set to expire next year, and if these cuts 
     are not extended, a family of four in North Carolina will 
     face a tax hike of about $1,400.
       To prevent tax increases for workers and businesses 
     nationwide, Im working with my colleagues to extend and 
     potentially make permanent President Trumps 2017 tax cuts. 
     This would ensure we avoid the largest middle and lower class 
     tax increase in American history, stimulate job growth, make 
     American businesses more competitive, and support American 
     workers by helping them keep more of their hard-earned 
     dollars in their wallets.
       Small business victory over beneficial ownership reporting 
     requirements:
       Small businesses saw a major victory in the fight against 
     beneficial ownership reporting requirements with the 
     Financial Crimes Enforcement Networks new ruling that 
     exempts U.S. small businesses from having to report 
     Beneficial Ownership Information under the Corporate 
     Transparency Act.
       As we move through the 119th Congress, I will continue to 
     be a voice for WNCs small business owners whose hard work 
     benefits our communities and strengthens our economy.
           With my warmest regards,
                                                    Chuck Edwards,
     Member of Congress.
the voting machine did not register the 
vote. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 146.
I rise today to honor Kaley Stidham for her 
service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
  A London, Kentucky native, Kaley began her career as an intern for 
her hometown member and Dean of the House Congressman Hal Rogers (KY-
05) followed by an internship with Senate Republican Leader Mitch 
McConnell (KY). During her Senior Year at the University of Kentucky, 
Kaley became the Staff Assistant for Congressman Andy Barr (KY-06) in 
his Lexington, Kentucky office and upon graduation in May 2023 
transitioned to his Washington, D.C. office and shortly after took on 
the role as Press Assistant as well. When I became Chairman of the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce in January of this year, Kaley 
joined my team as the Press Assistant where she became a valuable team 
member in keeping the American public updated on what our committee has 
been doing to restore the American Dream.
  Recently, Kaley departed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce 
to take on a new role as the Communications Director for Congresswoman 
Kat Cammack (FL-03). While she will no longer be working for a member 
of the Kentucky delegation, I know she will succeed in her new role. I 
wish her the best, congratulate her on her new role, and thank Kaley 
Stidham for her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
I rise today to recognize Parker Wells 
for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
  Parker has overcome many challenges along his journey to success, 
demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make 
the most of their education, like Parker, develop crucial skills and a 
work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award 
is a testament to Parkers hard work, determination, and perseverance 
at Three Creeks K-8 and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and 
promising future.
  It is my honor to congratulate Parker Wells on achieving the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
I rise today to recognize Presley Griego 
for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
  Presley has overcome many challenges along her journey to success, 
demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make 
the most of their education, like Presley, develop crucial skills and a 
work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award 
is a testament to Presleys hard work, determination, and perseverance 
at Mandalay Middle School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright 
and promising future.
  It is my honor to congratulate Presley Griego on achieving the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Mr. Sean Arnold has made to our community in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Milton. In addition to providing countless hours 
of direct support to neighbors and flood victims, he helped coordinate 
the collection and distribution of emergency supplies, meals and 
donated services to help those who needed help. A truly selfless 
leader, Mr. Arnold was a strong advocate for bringing in government and 
non-profit resources to aid in the recovery process.
  It is clear Sean Arnold has made a profoundly positive impact on our 
community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to 
serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Shae Burgess has made to our community as a 
volunteer with Pasco County Schools. Shaes has been an integral part 
of organizing a more robust support system for the schools athletic 
teams. With a passion for sports and a heart for service, Shae took on 
the challenge of revitalizing the athletic booster program. Under 
Shaes leadership, the booster program has flourished. They have 
organized numerous fundraising events and supported multiple school 
organizations. These funds have been used to purchase new equipment, 
upgrade facilities, and provide scholarships for student-athletes. 
Shaes innovative ideas and relentless drive have not only increased 
financial support but also boosted community involvement and school 
spirit. In addition to her work with the booster program, Shae 
volunteers directly with the sports teams. Shae is always there to lend 
a hand and mentor other volunteers. Shaes commitment to the school 
extends to the staff as well. Recognizing the hard work and dedication 
of teachers and administrators, Shae has initiated several programs to 
show appreciation for their efforts. She organizes staff appreciation 
events, where teachers and staff are treated to breakfast or lunch, and 
receive tokens of gratitude from the community. Through her actions, 
Shae has fostered a sense of unity and pride within the school 
community. Her ability to bring people together, whether its parents, 
students, or staff, has created a supportive environment. Shaes impact 
is felt not just in the success of the athletic programs, but in the 
overall morale and spirit of the school. Shae Burgess is a remarkable 
volunteer whose dedication and hard work have made a lasting 
difference. Shaes story is a testament to the power of volunteerism 
and the profound impact one person can have when they commit to making 
a difference.
  It is clear Shae Burgess has made a profoundly positive impact on our 
community, and

I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve our 
communities with the same dedication and humility.
I had the privilege of visiting Zion 
United Methodist Church in historic Bargaintown, South Jersey, as they 
were awarded an America 250 marker to honor the American Revolution 
patriots buried on their grounds. This church has a rich history, 
dating back to 1764, when it was built by Presbyterian residents and 
American Revolution patriot, John Brainerd. In 1814, the Methodists 
purchased the building before constructing the brick church that still 
stands today. This Church serves as the final resting place for many 
brave American soldiers from both the Revolutionary War and the Civil 
War. Walking through its grounds is a powerful reminder of the 
sacrifices made for our freedom. But the Church isnt just about 
preserving history--its about serving the community. Through missions 
like their Free Food and Walk-In Pantry Distribution, online Bible 
study, and summer concert series, they continue their mission of faith 
and service. I thank Zion Methodist Church, for the great things they 
do through the love of Jesus and for their incredible commitment to 
remembering the first heroes to our great Nation. God bless Zion 
Methodist Church and God bless our United States of America.
