                              of new york
I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 
Erie County Medical Centers Center for Occupational and Environmental 
Medicine as they commemorate a decade of service to the public. 
Established in 2014, the Center for Occupational and Environmental 
Medicine was created as a state-of-the-art medical resource dedicated 
to the occupational and environmental health field.
  Over the past decade, the Center has steadfastly fulfilled its 
mission to provide high-quality healthcare services for all in the 
Western New York legion. With a commitment to preventing work-related 
illnesses and injuries, the Center has become an invaluable asset to 
our community, ensuring that workers receive the comprehensive care 
they deserve.
  The Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine team has 
diligently served thousands of patients, addressing a wide range of 
health issues related to the workplace. The Center offers an array of 
clinical services tailored to meet the needs of our dynamic Western New 
York workforce. The inclusion of social work and wellness programs is 
often reflected in their holistic approach to health, recognizing that 
well-being extends beyond mere medical treatment.
  The impact of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine 
reaches far beyond individual patients. By managing the broad spectrum 
of diseases associated with workplace exposures, they contribute to a 
healthier workforce and a stronger community. Each patient treated, 
each injury prevented, and each illness managed helps to uphold the 
fabric of our community and ensures that all who contribute to our 
local economy can do so with the assurance of care and support.
  Today, as we look back on the past ten years, let us also look 
forward with hope and determination. The need for occupational and 
environmental health services is as critical as ever. Congratulations 
to the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine as they 
continue to innovate, adapt, and expand our services to meet the ever-
evolving needs of our community.
CELEBRATING WARREN B. GELMANS INDUCTION INTO THE GREATER BUFFALO 
                              of new york
I rise today to celebrate Warren B. 
Gelmans induction into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame--a 
fitting tribute to his lifetime of service, leadership, and dedication 
to the athletic community of Western New York. Mr. Gelmans life is a 
testament to the power of passion, hard work, and a commitment to 
others.
  As one of the founding members of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of

since its inception in 1991. As chair of the Nominating Committee for 
the Hall of Fame, Warren helped shape its structure, bringing together 
a group of passionate volunteers who sought to honor the legions 
greatest athletes and sports figures. His tireless work over the years 
has contributed to the Hall of Fames enduring legacy.
A former three-sport athlete, Warren excelled in 
soccer, hockey, and baseball before continuing his athletic journey at 
Yale University. There, he captained both the undefeated 1963-1964 
freshman hockey team and the 1966-1967 varsity hockey team, which 
earned a ranking as the 5th best team in the East.
a trailblazer for girls sports in our community. 
In 1986, recognizing a void in opportunities for female athletes, he 
founded the Bison Girls Hockey Program, the first of its kind in 
Western New York. His efforts opened doors for countless young women to 
compete in hockey at the highest levels.
  Today, we celebrate Warren B. Gelman, and his induction to the 
Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. His contributions to Western New 
Yorks sports community, particularly his efforts to elevate the 
visibility and opportunities for women in athletics, have had a lasting 
and profound impact on the region. Mr. Gelmans legacy of service, 
leadership, and dedication will continue to inspire generations of 
athletes, coaches, and community leaders for years to come.
I include in the Record the 
following Proclamation: Whereas, Thomas Jefferson University was 
founded in 1824 as the Jefferson Medical College, now Sidney Kimmel 
Medical College, and served as one of the nations first medical 
schools;
  Whereas, Jefferson Medical College was the first medical college to 
open a clinic for the poor and accept free patients;
  Whereas, Jefferson quickly became a pioneer in medical education, and 
since its founding 200 years ago, has grown into a renowned university, 
regional health system, and non-profit health insurer;
  Whereas, for two centuries, Jefferson faculty and graduates have been 
innovators and leaders in education, research, discovery and clinical 
care, with achievements ranging from the discovery of the mosquito 
vector for yellow fever and the invention of the heart-lung machine to 
the development of nationally recognized textile engineering and 
fashion design programs;

embarks on its third century of education, discovery, healthcare, and 
community engagement.
I rise today to recognize Sunday, November 
17th as the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. Each 
year, the third Sunday in November, the World Day of Remembrance for 
Road Traffic Victims is a chance to commemorate the millions of lives 
lost or injured due to road accidents. On this day we also pay tribute 
to emergency responders and medical professionals who answer the calls 
and face the trauma of road death and injury daily.
  According to the Association for Safe International Road Travel, an 
estimated 1.35 million people around the world die in road crashes each 
year. This is a crisis that continues day in and day out in all 
countries of the world. Affecting primarily our most vulnerable 
communities and our youth. Therefore, during the new Decade of Action 
2021-2030 the World Day will have the important role of helping to 
achieve the 50 percent road casualty reduction target.
, please join me today as we remember the victims of road 
traffic collisions and their families. In honoring the lives ended too 
soon, we face the profound losses of the communities they left behind 
and a responsibility to do everything in our power to ensure these 
tragedies become rarities. We must protect the lives of all road users, 
and I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do 
that.
I rise today to honor the life of a long-time 
pillar of the Southeast Houston community, Marie Flickinger, who passed 
away on November 11, 2024.
  After becoming the first woman elected to the San Jacinto College 
District Board of Trustees in 1995, Marie served as Chair from 2007 to 
2013 and again from 2017 until her retirement on November 4, 2024. She 
spent these nearly 30 years devoted to ensuring the institutions 
success, achieving numerous awards along the way.
  Many have referred to Marie as the honorary ``Mayor of South Belt 
due to her involvement in practically every aspect of the community, an 
extensive list that included the founding of the South Belt-Ellington 
Chamber of Commerce, the local newspaper, and St. Luke the Evangelist 
Catholic Church, as well as the organization of countless community 
events.
  As a co-founder and publisher of the South Belt-Ellington Leader, 
Marie became known for her work shedding light on the impact of the 
Brio Superfund site in the 1980s, which eventually led to its 
remediation. Marie also

delved into the political arena, serving on two Mayoral Transition 
Committees for the City of Houston.
, I have no doubt Maries legacy will be remembered, and 
my prayers are with her family, her San Jacinto College family, and the 
South Belt community during this difficult time.
I rise today to honor and recognize Mr. 
Philip Christopher, a leader and steadfast advocate for freedom and 
justice for the Cypriot people. For over 50 years, Mr. Christopher has 
championed the cause of Cyprus, dedicating his life to the struggle for 
the reunification of Cyprus, the rights of the Cypriot people, and the 
broader Hellenic community.
``Justice for Cyprus (PSEKA). Through these organizations, he has 
tirelessly promoted Cypriot sovereignty and human rights, advocating on 
behalf of Cyprus and Hellenic issues with passion and dedication. As a 
refugee, who was forced to flee his beautiful homeland of Kyrenia, 
Cyprus following the illegal occupation of the island nation by the 
Turkish military in 1974, no one is more passionate and dedicated to 
these issues than he is. His efforts have left a lasting impact, as he 
has worked to ensure that the voice of the Greek Cypriot community is 
heard in the halls of Congress and across the United States.
  Philip Christophers contributions have not gone unrecognized. He has 
received numerous honors, including the Republic of Cyprus Medal of 
Honor, the title of Honorary Mayor of Kyrenia, and honorary 
citizenships from multiple Cypriot communities. He was also the first 
Greek Cypriot to receive the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 
the United States. In 2024, he served as Parade General Chairman of the 
NYC Greek Independence Day Parade. These awards and recognition are a 
testament to his exemplary commitment to his community and his 
invaluable role as a bridge between Cypriot and American interests.
  Beyond his advocacy, Mr. Christopher has demonstrated significant 
achievements as an executive in the telecommunications industry and as 
a board member of various respected organizations. His dedication to 
excellence in both his professional and community endeavors is an 
inspiration.
  Today, I commend Philip Christopher for his enduring dedication to 
Cyprus and the Hellenic community and express gratitude for his 
tireless efforts to further the cause of justice and freedom. His 
legacy stands as a beacon of leadership and commitment that strengthens 
the bonds between Cyprus and the United States.
I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of John Errante of Springfield, Missouri, who recently passed away 
after a three-year battle with cancer. He was 41 years old.
  John was an amazing individual. He was self-taught and a member of 
Mensa. As his long-time friend, Beau, said of him, ``He was routinely 
the smartest man in the room, in a room filled with smart people. He 
had a way of seeing to the core of a problem, and embracing and 
implementing solutions no one else would have considered, much less 
tried.
  John loved the arts and was a composer and a concert pianist. As a 
teenager, he became involved in politics and attended the Leadership 
Institute here in Washington, DC. While there, our homeland was 
attacked on September 11th, which had a profound effect on John. This 
led him to join the U.S. Army where he served in Army Psychological 
Operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
  After leaving the military, John moved to Springfield where he 
graduated from Missouri State University on the Presidents List, the 
universitys highest honor reserved for those who receive a 4.0 grade 
point average or higher. He again became involved in politics, serving 
as the communications director for his friend Bills gubernatorial 
campaign. Ultimately, he became employed as a marketing specialist with 
MediaCom.
  Johns life was defined by service . . . to his country, to his 
neighbors, to his family and friends. He was taken from us too soon and 
will be greatly missed by his father, Steven Errante, his mother, Arla 
Collins and a host of friends who loved him. It is my great honor to 
recognize this remarkable individual, and I am praying for peace, 
comfort and good memories for his family.
I was not present to vote on November 14, 
2024 as I was attending to the medical emergency of a member of my 
staff.
  Had I been present, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 461; YEA 
on Roll Call No. 462; NAY on Roll Call No. 463; and YEA on Roll Call 
No. 464.
today I rise to recognize Illece Buckley 
Weber, Mayor of the City of Agoura Hills, and an inspirational public 
servant who has dedicated her career to being a voice for the people 
who call this beautiful and vibrant community home.
  Throughout her tenure, Mayor Buckley Weber has been a tireless 
advocate for her community, prioritizing the values of collaboration, 
service, and progress. Her leadership has not only guided Agoura Hills 
through challenging moments but has also laid the foundation for 
continued growth and prosperity.
  In 1992, Illece moved to Agoura Hills with her husband Joe and their 
two children, Sara and David. Seeking that quintessential small-town 
feel and an excellent school district, Illece and Joe knew Agoura Hills 
was the right fit for their family. We are so fortunate that they chose 
to make this wonderful city their home.
  At the heart of public service is the burning desire to create a 
better world for our children--a world where they can learn and grow to 
reach their fullest potential. Illeces commitment to serving this 
unique city was only strengthened by her deep appreciation and 
admiration for Agoura Hills bountiful natural beauty. It is no 
surprise that she decided to take the next step and immerse herself in 
local governance. In 2006, she was appointed to the Agoura Hills 
Planning Commission, and in 2011, she was elected to the City Council, 
where she has dutifully and faithfully served the Agoura Hills 
community for nearly 13 years.
  Illece has served on all of the citys subcommittees with an emphasis 
on Public Works, Environmental Sustainability, and Community Services. 
A fierce defender and protector of the citys natural landscape, Illece 
currently serves as the Chairperson and Agoura Hills representative on 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Advisory Committee as well as 
the Chair of the CalCities Environmental Quality Policy Committee.
  In addition to her prominent committee roles and leadership positions 
across our region, Illece has had the honor of serving as the City of 
Agoura Hills Mayor in 2015, 2020, and 2024. Her steadfast and positive 
leadership has been enjoyed not only by the residents of Agoura Hills, 
but also by the many families, businesses, and organizations of the 
Conejo Valley.
  Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to work with 
Illece to bring to fruition two projects near and dear to her heart--
and to the heart of this community. In partnership with the City of 
Agoura Hills, we successfully secured $3 million in federal funding for 
the civic center microgrid and the design and construction of critical 
infrastructure of the citys bicycle master plan.
  Mayor Buckley Webers commitment to enhancing the quality of life for 
the residents of Agoura Hills is evident in every initiative she has 
championed. Whether working on preserving the citys open spaces, 
improving public services, or fostering a strong sense of community, 
she has always placed the needs of her constituents and her neighbors 
at the center of her work.
  Beyond her achievements on the Agoura Hills City Council, Mayor 
Buckley Weber has also served as a role model for civic engagement. Her 
dedication and passion for public service have inspired countless 
individuals in Agoura Hills to get involved and make a positive impact 
in their own community.
  As she steps down from her seat on the City Council, I am proud to 
join our community in acknowledging her profound contributions and 
expressing our gratitude for her leadership. Agoura Hills is a better 
place because of her vision and hard work, and her legacy will continue 
to inspire those who follow in her footsteps.
, it is with great admiration and respect that I recognize 
Illece Buckley Weber for her remarkable service to the City of Agoura 
Hills. We thank her for her dedication and wish her all the best in the 
next chapter of her journey.
this week the House will consider two 
bills that aim to fix problems within Social Security law, H.R. 82 and 
H.R. 5342. I rise in support of H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness 
Act. This legislation takes a necessary and long-overdue step forward 
in improving Social Security and ensuring that retirees across America 
have access to their hard-earned benefits.
  H.R. 82 has strong bipartisan support--the most of any bill during 
this session of Congress--and theres good reason for that. This bill 
repeals the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall 
Elimination Provision (WEP), two provisions of Social Security law that 
reduce and, in some cases, fully cancel out Social Security benefits 
for Civil Services Retirement system recipients and other public sector 
employees who have worked in state and local government. The GPO and 
WEP create financial hardship for Americas retired teachers, police 
officers, postal workers, firefighters, and other public employees and 
their families who have spent their careers in public service. H.R. 82 
bill passed the House by a vote of 327-75, with one Member voting 
present.
  I oppose H.R. 5342, the Equal Treatment of Public Service Act, an 
alternative bill proposed to address shortcomings within Social 
Security law. Unlike H.R. 82, this bill fails to address the GPO and 
takes the WEP exemption away from millions of Americans who are 
currently exempt. Additionally, instead of asking the wealthy to pay 
their fair share, this bill is paid for by expanding the number of 
people subject to the WEP, resulting in a benefit cut for millions of 
everyday Americans.
  Social Security is the nations number one anti-poverty program for 
the elderly and for

children. We must keep this program strong and ensure that it is 
working for all Americans. I stand with Americas public employees in 
their mission to change this program for the better.
