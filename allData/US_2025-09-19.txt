I rise today to honor the remarkable career 
and retirement of Mr. Syd Loomis, a lifelong Hoosier, dedicated 
professional, and beloved member of the Noblesville community.
  Born in Waukegan, Illinois, to Joseph ``Jay and Marlene ``Mitzi 
Loomis, Syd grew up with strong family values that would guide him 
throughout his life. A 1978 graduate of Noblesville High School, he 
married his wife Jeanine in 1982, and together they raised three 
wonderful children--Caryn, Amy, and Spencer. Today, Syd is the proud 
grandfather of four granddaughters, who bring him great joy and who 
affectionately know him as a devoted supporter of their softball games, 
dance recitals, and family traditions.
  Syds career in banking has spanned over 45 years. Beginning in 1980 
as a teller at American National Bank, he went on to serve with 
AmeriTrust, Society, Key Bank, Metro, First Indiana, First National, 
BMO Harris, and, for the past 15 years to the day, The Farmers Bank, 
where he served as Assistant Vice President and Branch Manager. Syd was 
not just a banker, he was a mentor to young professionals, a trusted 
advisor to countless customers, and a friendly face who treated 
everyone like family. His service was recognized with numerous honors, 
including induction into the Indiana Bankers Associations 40-Year 
Banker Club, the Community Pride Award in 2011, and the Keep 
Noblesville Beautiful Award in 2013.
  Beyond his professional career, Syd has always given generously of 
his time and talents to his community. He has served on the boards of 
the Noblesville Chamber of Commerce, the Shepherd Center of Hamilton 
County, and the Hamilton Heights Youth Assistance Program. He is also 
well known for his love of the arts, beginning community theatre in 
1998 and performing in beloved roles such as George Bailey in Its a 
Wonderful Life, Daddy Warbucks in Annie, and the Tin Man in The Wizard 
of Oz. His performances earned several Encore Awards and brought joy to 
audiences across Hamilton County. Syd also shared his love of music in 
the choir of First Presbyterian Church, where his faith and voice have 
lifted others for decades.
  Syd is affectionately known by many as the ``unofficial mayor of 
Noblesville, a fitting title for a man who never met a stranger and 
always left a lasting impression. I am personally grateful to have 
worked alongside Syd, who was my boss when I was a bank teller. His 
kindness, humility, and encouragement left a deep impression on me, as 
I know they have on so many others.
, on behalf of Indianas 5th Congressional District, I 
wish to extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. Loomis for his many years 
of dedicated service as a community leader and as a true community 
banker, the kind of which we need more.
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF CHARLES ``CHARLIE JAMES KIRK
the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk was 
reprehensible. Members of Congress pray for Charlies wife, Erika, 
their two young children, and all who loved him during their time of 
mourning and grief. We also extend our prayers to all who were present 
on the Utah Valley University campus at the time of this tragedy, who 
will carry the trauma of that day with them forever.
  In recent years, a disturbing and unacceptable pattern has emerged: 
individuals being targeted for their role in public life or for their 
association with political discourse. Violence of this nature is not an 
attack on one person alone--it is an assault on democracy itself, meant 
to silence debate, sow fear, and tear at the fabric of our civil 
society.
  We remember the assassination attempt on Congresswoman Gabby 
Giffords, which left her critically injured and six innocent lives 
lost. We remember the shooting at a Congressional baseball game 
practice, which seriously wounded Congressman Steve Scalise and injured 
five others. We recall the chilling plot to kidnap Michigan Governor 
Gretchen Whitmer. We will not forget the storming of the United States 
Capitol on January 6th, which resulted in the deaths of five law 
enforcement officers and shook the very foundations of our democracy.
  My own family still lives with the trauma of a near-deadly attack on 
my husband, Paul, in our home by an individual seeking to kidnap me--an 
act of violence that underscored in the most personal way the 
escalating threats that public officials and their loved ones endure.
  We have also seen assassination attempts on the life of President 
Donald Trump; the arson targeting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiros 
residence and family; the heartbreaking assassination of Minnesota 
House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the 
attempted assassination of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. And 
now, we are horrified by the murder of Charlie Kirk, targeted while 
exercising his right to speak freely on a college campus.
  All of these incidents must be denounced unequivocally and without 
qualification. Violence has no place in our political process, in our 
communities, or in our country. At the same time, we have a solemn 
responsibility to act. Congress must work with state and local leaders, 
law enforcement, and communities to ensure the security of Members, 
staff, and constituents alike--so that all Americans may fully 
participate in civic life without fear. That also means we must address 
the epidemic of gun violence in our country to keep our children and 
their families safe.
  Let us be clear: political differences must be resolved at the ballot 
box and through dialogue, never through the barrel of a gun or the 
threat of violence. The strength of our democracy lies not in 
unanimity, but in the peaceful contest of ideas. Together, we must 
recommit to protecting that principle and the American

people, to lowering the temperature of political rhetoric, and to 
honoring the dignity and humanity of every person engaged in public 
service.
I rise to recognize the Afghan American 
Community Organization on the celebration of their tenth anniversary on 
September 20, 2025.
  For a decade, the Afghan American Community Organization has served 
as a trusted, compassionate partner to Afghan and Afghan American 
families--strengthening civic participation, expanding opportunity, and 
celebrating a rich cultural heritage that is now a vibrant part of my 
district and the American story.
  Whether it has been English language and citizenship classes, youth 
mentorship and college readiness, small business advising, or workforce 
development, the Afghan American Community Organization has opened 
doors for thousands in the Afghan American community. Its legal and 
resettlement clinics have helped newcomers navigate complex systems 
with dignity. The mental-health and womens empowerment initiatives 
have provided care and community, and its cultural events have fostered 
understanding between neighbors.
  When Afghans arrived in large numbers following the fall of Kabul, 
Afghan American Community Organization mobilized volunteers, partnered 
with faith and civic groups, and worked together with local, state, and 
federal agencies to secure housing, enroll children in school, connect 
families with health care, and ensure that no one was left behind.
  On this milestone anniversary, I congratulate the Afghan American 
Community Organization Board, dedicated staff, volunteers, and 
community partners whose steadfast efforts made this achievement 
possible. Their work reminds us that welcoming the newcomer and lifting 
our neighbors are enduring American values.
  I congratulate them on ten years of service, and wish the Afghan 
American Community Organization continued success in the decades ahead.
I was unable to vote on September 
18, 2025. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 
277; YEA on Roll Call No. 278; and YEA on Roll Call No. 279.
RECOGNIZING MS. CAMILLA ``CAM WILLIAMS FOR HER DEDICATED SERVICE TO 
                              of michigan
today I rise to recognize and honor Camilla 
``Cam Williams for her extraordinary dedication, service, and 
unwavering commitment to the Republican Party and to our shared 
conservative values.
  For well over a decade, Cam has been a faithful Republican precinct 
delegate and a constant presence in efforts to support Republican 
candidates at the local, state, and national level. She has given 
countless hours of her time to ensure that our Partys message is heard 
and that our candidates have the support they need to succeed.
  Cam has set records in the State of Michigan for the most phone calls 
made in support of Republican candidates, an achievement that 
demonstrates not only her dedication, but also her determination to 
connect with voters and strengthen our Nation through grassroots 
engagement. She has given thousands of hours of volunteer service, 
never asking for recognition or reward. Her work has been marked by 
passion, humility, and humor. Through her vigor and tireless spirit, 
she has shown us all what it means to serve faithfully.
  Cam embodies the very best of what it means to be a Patriot, someone 
who works not for personal gain, but out of love for her community, her 
country, and the values that have guided generations of Americans. The 
positive impact of her service is felt across Michigan and beyond and 
will continue to inspire future leaders in our movement.
, on behalf of the people of Michigans 1st Congressional 
District, I thank Camilla Williams for her service, her leadership, and 
her enduring commitment to the conservative cause.
RECOGNIZING NORFOLKS JERRY LANDKAMER ON HIS ELECTION AS NATIONAL VICE 
                              of nebraska
I rise today to congratulate a true pillar of 
the Norfolk community, Jerry Landkamer, on his recent election as one 
of five National Vice Commanders of the American Legion.
  A proud Legionnaire since 1975, Landkamer has been a cornerstone of 
Post 16 in Norfolk. He has served at every level--post, county, 
district, and area--with unmatched dedication to representing our 
veteran community.
  From legislative advocacy in Washington to youth programs like 
Cornhusker Boys State, Landkamers commitment to service has never 
wavered.
  His work on national committees including--Americanism, Homeland 
Security, and Veterans Preference--demonstrates his steadfast 
commitment to our veterans and Nation.
  Jerry Landkamer embodies the very spirit and service of the American 
Legion. Im honored to recognize his election to National Vice 
Commander and know his family and community share in the same pride of 
this well-earned achievement.
I am proud to welcome the Ecumenical 
Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew, to 
Washington, D.C. this week, and to congratulate him on receiving the 
distinguished Templeton Prize.
  His All-Holiness has been a steadfast leader for the Orthodox Church, 
and especially for my constituents in New Jersey. He continues to 
encourage us all to reach toward peace, to love and respect our 
neighbors, and to uphold our values as a Nation.
  At a time when hate and intolerance are surging across the country, 
His All-Holinesss focus on religious freedom is a powerful reminder 
that we must work together and respect one another. In the greatest 
country in the world, there should be no room for intolerance or hate 
of any kind.
  As His All-Holiness Bartholomew has said, ``We have it in our power 
either to increase the hurt inflicted on our world or to contribute 
toward its healing. The choice is ours. Together, we must work toward 
a world filled with healing and hope.
