                      CONGRATULATING EYOLE MBONGO

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. 
Eyole M. Mbongo of San Antonio, Texas, who received the Outstanding 
Congressional Staffer Award on December 1, 2023 from the Hispanic 
Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) in recognition of his 
exceptional dedication to advancing equity in education.
  In 2014, Mr. Mbongo joined my Congressional staff as an intern while 
completing his master&#x27;s degree in public administration at the 
University of Texas, San Antonio. After his graduation, I hired him as 
a constituent services representative in my district office, where he 
worked to help residents of the 20th District of Texas access programs 
and services within the federal government. After almost two years in 
my district office, he joined my staff in Washington D.C., where he now 
serves as a senior legislative assistant.
  Over the course of his work with my office, Mr. Mbongo has led the 
fight to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding back 
to San Antonio schools and universities--helping them chart a path 
forward through the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic and close 
racial and socioeconomic gaps in college attendance and completion.
  During the current session of Congress, Mr. Mbongo has been a 
critical advisor in the introduction of several bills and resolutions, 
including:
  The Hispanic Educational Resources and Empowerment Act (HERE Act), 
which would authorize a grant program to support partnerships between 
Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and school districts with high 
enrollment of Latino students to improve college readiness and degree 
attainment.
  The Advanced Coursework Equity Act, which would authorize a grant 
program to address equity gaps in enrollment and performance in 
advanced programs and courses.
  A resolution to designate the week beginning on September 11, 2023 as 
National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week.
  There is no one more qualified or deserving of this award than Mr. 
Mbongo, and I am grateful to the Hispanic Association of Colleges and 
Universities for recognizing the profound impact of his work.
  I congratulate Mr. Mbongo--he makes San Antonio proud.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brigadier General 
Michael ``Mike&#x27;&#x27; Cates of Frisco, Texas, and award him a Congressional 
Veteran Commendation. General Cates honorably served in the United 
States Army as the 23rd Chief of the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps.
  In 1980, General Cates followed in his family&#x27;s footsteps and joined 
the Army after obtaining his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree at 
Texas A&amp;M University. He specialized in veterinary services in South 
Korea and Germany, and was the first veterinarian to command the Army&#x27;s 
Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine. I commend his 
extensive efforts to improve public health and the wellbeing of animals 
in the military. For his exemplary service, General Cates was awarded 
the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, 
and several other awards. In 2005, he was named a Distinguished Alumnus 
of Texas A&amp;M&#x27;s College of Veterinary Medicine.
  After his retirement in 2008, General Cates continued to make 
profound impacts in his community in many ways. He became a professor 
at Kansas State University&#x27;s College of Veterinary Medicine and served 
as their Master of Public Health Graduate Program Director. As the 
Program Director, General Cates helped prepare students for success in 
public health careers. When he retired from academia, he served as a 
board member for the Heritage Association and Pet Partners in Frisco. 
In these roles, General Cates helped preserve Frisco&#x27;s rich history and 
supported local animal shelters so that they may have a safe place to 
call home. These actions highlight his commitment to uplifting the 
world around him and being a voice for those in need.
  I am honored to represent BG Cates in Texas&#x27; 4th Congressional 
District. It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran 
Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North 
Texas.

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief Petty 
Officer William ``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Anderson of Denison, Texas, and award him a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation. CPO Anderson served in the United 
States Navy, and his impressive career experience highlights his 
genuine passion for helping our community.
  CPO Anderson was inspired to join the Navy after gaining a deep 
respect and appreciation for our nation&#x27;s veterans of prior conflicts. 
Originally, CPO Anderson wanted to stay in the Navy Reserves, but after 
the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, he wanted to do more to bring 
the perpetrators of this attack to justice. To accomplish this, he 
pursued a deployment to Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2008, where he 
served in numerous support roles, including the Naval Security Forces 
and Navy Customs. Furthermore, CPO Anderson qualified as a Seabee 
Combat Warfare Officer. Seabees are well known for being able to build 
infrastructure anywhere around the world at a moment&#x27;s notice. If you 
needed a military base, airfield, or bridge halfway around the world, 
CPO Anderson is the person you&#x27;d call to get the job done. For his 
service to our nation, CPO Anderson was bestowed the Bronze Star, Army 
and Navy Commendation medals, and many more awards. In 2005, he met his 
future wife Teresa, and they married three years later. Together, they 
raised two children.
  After his retirement from the Navy in 2013, CPO Anderson continued to 
serve his nation through various civilian roles, and even supported 
counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan. When he returned to Texas, 
CPO Anderson worked at the Denison Dam Power Plant to help maintain 
Texas&#x27; electrical grid. Today, he continues his career with the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers providing emergency power relief to those 
affected by natural disasters. In his recreational time, he is a 
Scoutmaster for Troop 55 in Pottsboro and Denison, where seven boys 
have attained the rank of Eagle Scout under his guidance.
  I am honored to represent CPO Anderson in Texas&#x27; 4th Congressional 
District. It is a privilege to award him the Congressional Veteran 
Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North 
Texas.

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gunnery Sergeant 
Michael DeHaven of Denison, Texas, and award him a Congressional 
Veteran Commendation. GySgt DeHaven honorably served in the United 
States Marine Corps during the Gulf War and the Global War on 
Terrorism.
  As a young man, GySgt DeHaven heeded the call to serve his nation in 
the Marine Corps. In 1986, he joined the Marines and later became a 
member of the 5th Force Reconnaissance Company. GySgt DeHaven 
specialized in high-altitude parachuting, underwater operations, and 
reconnaissance in support of Marine Expeditionary Forces. Some of his 
responsibilities included protecting government officials, safeguarding 
intelligence officers, training allied forces, and conducting raids on 
high value targets. GySgt DeHaven&#x27;s efforts helped to protect the 
wellbeing of countless Americans and our allies. For his selfless 
service and contributions to our national security, GySgt DeHaven was 
awarded the National Intelligence Medal for Valor.
  After he was honorably discharged in 1998, GySgt DeHaven pursued a 
successful career in technology. However, the September 11 terrorist 
attacks reinforced his desire to defend his nation from all threats, 
foreign and domestic. He returned to military service, and served as a 
ground reconnaissance advisor with the 6th Marine Regiment and as an 
anti-terrorism advisor to our intelligence community until 2021. When 
he returned to Texas, GySgt DeHaven looked for ways to protect our 
nation&#x27;s children in the wake of the terrible events in Uvalde. He 
opened a private consulting company to help enhance school safety and 
threat prevention efforts. Through his valuable expertise, the Denison 
Independent School District selected him to serve as their Director of 
Safety and Security. Without question, GySgt DeHaven&#x27;s extensive 
experience in combatting hostile threats will help to protect our 
schools and communities.
  I am honored to represent GySgt DeHaven in Texas&#x27; 4th Congressional 
District. It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran 
Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North 
Texas.

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Staff Sergeant 
Johann Schrap of Rockwall, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran 
Commendation. Sergeant Schrap honorably served in the United States Air 
Force during the Vietnam War.
  As a young man, Sergeant Schrap sailed with his family when they 
immigrated to the United States. As his ship passed by the Statue of 
Liberty, he understood that the values of democracy and freedom it 
represents and knew these come only through sacrifices. During the 
Second World War, Sergeant Schrap&#x27;s father helped provide refuge for 
Jewish citizens in the Netherlands from persecution by the Nazi regime. 
For these actions, his father was imprisoned but was rescued by 
American forces when the Allies liberated Holland. As a token of 
appreciation for American assistance to his family, Sergeant Schrap 
chose to serve his country and joined the Air Force. He was eventually 
sent to Saigon, Vietnam as part of the 75th Military Airlift Squadron 
where he assisted in postal and administrative operations. In this 
role, Sergeant Schrap managed incoming mail and ensured that soldiers 
received correspondence from home in a timely fashion. For his service 
and contributions to our nation, Sergeant Schrap received several 
awards, including the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, Air Force 
Commendation Medal, and Silver Rose.
  After returning home, Sergeant Schrap attended California Baptist 
University in California and later received a degree in Biblical 
Studies. As part of the First Baptist Church in Garland, Texas, he 
participated in several mission trips to help rebuild homes that were 
damaged by natural disasters. Sergeant Schrap ran a very successful 
small business specializing in home repairs, painting, and remodeling. 
He is a member of Vietnam Veterans of America and Disabled American 
Veterans, where he conducts veteran outreach

[[Page E1171]]

and provides guidance for veterans to receive assistance. Sergeant 
Schrap also has a keen eye for spotting veterans in public, and he will 
happily engage with them in order to listen to their stories or help in 
any way he can. I highly commend Sergeant Schrap for continuing to 
uplift the men and women who served our nation and uplifting the 
community around him.
  I am honored to represent Sergeant Schrap in Texas&#x27; 4th Congressional 
District. It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran 
Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North 
Texas.

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today the 12th Congressional District mourns 
the loss of Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams, a beloved spiritual and 
community leader and activist in our district whose influence reached 
many across our state and the world.
  Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams graduated with honors from the 
University of Michigan and Harvard University and went on to become a 
doctoral fellow in Union Theological Seminary in New York City. From 
1962 to 1969, Dr. Adams served as Pastor of the historic Concord 
Baptist Church in Boston. Shortly after, Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams 
was appointed as lead pastor for the historic Hartford Memorial Baptist 
Church in Detroit, a role

[[Page E1169]]

he held for more than fifty years. As pastor, he dedicated his life and 
mission to service, fighting for justice for our communities and 
improving the lives of residents in Northwest Detroit. He was a 
tireless advocate in the fight for safe housing for all and for 
affordable childcare for working families. Pastor Adams served as 
President of the Detroit Branch of the NAACP in 1984 and served on its 
executive board consecutive years until 1992.
  His bold and grounded leadership is a testament to his impactful work 
and legacy. The 12th Congressional District sends our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to Pastor Adams&#x27;s family and to the entire 
Hartford Memorial Baptist Church family on this significant loss to our 
community. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Agnes Adams and 
his children, Dr. Tara Adams Washington and Reverend Charles Christian 
Adams.
  Please join me in remembering Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams for his 
incredible spiritual leadership and impact on our district and the 
community. May he rest in love and his legacy continue to impact our 
community.

   HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF MARYLAND ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATOR LINDA 
                                 LAMONE

                                 ______

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my friend 
Linda Lamone: Maryland&#x27;s longest-serving Elections Administrator and 
the second-longest-serving chief elections official in America. In 
September, she retired after overseeing our elections for more than a 
quarter century. Linda is a woman of tremendous vision, integrity, and 
reverence for our democratic institutions, and we appreciate her 
outstanding service.
  After serving Marylanders for decades as a Counsel to the Maryland 
State Assembly, the Chief Legal Counsel to Governor Schaefer&#x27;s 
legislative office, a private attorney, and an Assistant Attorney 
General under Governor Glendening, Linda started as Elections 
Administrator in 1997. She oversaw 13 federal general elections, 
including six presidential elections, over the course of her impressive 
career.
  Linda started the role at a pivotal moment for American elections. 
New digital technologies offered new opportunities to enhance our 
electoral system. Around the same time, the 2000 presidential election 
revealed how vulnerabilities in our elections can undermine the 
American people&#x27;s faith in our democracy. That experience led me and a 
bipartisan group of Members to pass the Help America Vote Act to keep 
our elections secure, accessible, and transparent.
  Linda was instrumental in helping the Election Assistance Commission 
and I implement HAVA in Maryland and beyond. From modernizing and 
standardizing our state&#x27;s voting machines to digitizing campaign 
finance and voter registration resources, Linda brought our elections 
into the twenty-first century. She helped other states make progress in 
these areas through her involvement with the National Association of 
State Election Directors.
  Linda also helped our state and our democracy weather unprecedented 
crises. She led the effort to ensure that Marylanders could vote safely 
in the 2020 election during the Covid-19 pandemic. She also sought to 
maintain Americans&#x27; faith in their democratic system amid a wave of 
election denialism. We were fortunate to have Linda&#x27;s leadership in 
2020 and all the years before and since.
  No matter the task at hand or the challenge before her, Linda tackled 
it with determination. She always knew that she could count on the 
support of her family--especially her husband of 53 years, Rudy. As 
Dean of the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of 
Maryland, College Park, and as a prominent academic and entrepreneur, 
Rudy was another crucial leader in our community. We all mourned with 
Linda when he passed away earlier this year, and we continue to keep 
him in our prayers.
  As Linda brings her career to a close, we find ourselves at another 
pivotal moment for American elections. We see leaders openly cast doubt 
on the outcome of free and fair elections. Some people deliberately try 
to erode our electoral system and other democratic institutions. Linda 
Lamone serves as an example of the countless hardworking, principled 
elections officials across the country who help uphold our democracy in 
the face of these threats. Their work isn&#x27;t easy, but it is absolutely 
essential.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Linda and the democratic 
principles she devoted her career to protecting.

years of service of

[[Page E1168]]

Donald J. Herrington to the New Holland community, as he retires from 
public service as a member of the New Holland Borough Council.
  Mr. Herrington&#x27;s selfless service to the New Holland Community 
exceeds thirty years across two millennia. He entered service to the 
borough as a member of the Planning Commission, serving seven years 
followed by a term as Mayor of the borough for four years ending in 
1989.
  Mr. Herrington was recalled to the service of the borough in June of 
2000, as a Borough Council Member, a position which he held through the 
end of this year.
  In addition to his dedication to the borough, he also served his 
community as a coach for several local Garden Spot sports teams, and 
with the local Jaycees, eventually serving as the 37th President of the 
Pennsylvania Jaycees.
  Mr. Speaker, our communities across the nation are enriched through 
the selfless service of dedicated and talented individuals like Mr. 
Donald J. Herrington. We offer him our thanks and gratitude for his 
work to strengthen his community and we wish him well in all his future 
endeavors.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE NO FENCING AT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ACT

                                 ______

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the No Fencing at the 
United States Supreme Court Act, which would prohibit the installation 
of permanent fencing at the U.S. Supreme Court. Earlier this year, I 
introduced a bill that would prohibit the installation of permanent 
fencing at the U.S. Capitol complex.
  After the Supreme Court&#x27;s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s 
Health was leaked in May 2022, the Supreme Court installed temporary 
anti-climb fencing around its grounds, which remained in place until 
late August 2022. While the Supreme Court has not announced plans to 
install permanent fencing, temporary security measures often become 
permanent.
  While I understand the importance of protecting the Supreme Court 
building, Supreme Court Justices and Supreme Court employees, we can 
and must maintain our commitment to security without sacrificing public 
access by using the least restrictive means necessary to address 
security.
  Permanent fencing would send an un-American message to the nation and 
the world by transforming our democracy from one that is accessible and 
of the people to one that is exclusive and fearful of its own citizens. 
The Supreme Court has long welcomed First Amendment demonstrations 
without becoming a fortress.
  Public property should be open to the public. The distance between 
government and the people has grown, with trust in government, 
including the Supreme Court, low. We should not entrench that distance 
further by placing intimidating barriers between public servants and 
the people they serve. There are more effective, less obtrusive 
security solutions than archaic fencing.
  Moreover, the Supreme Court is in a residential neighborhood in the 
District of Columbia. The Supreme Court grounds are widely used by both 
D.C. residents and visitors. Permanent fencing would block that use.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                       OSCAR ORTIZ&#x27;S COMMENDATION

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DELIA C. RAMIREZ

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of my dear friend and constituent, Oscar Ortiz, a devoted organizer and 
champion for educational equity. Oscar was a visionary: he fought for a 
just, inclusive future where everyone thrives. He was a beloved 
husband, father, brother, son, and respected member of the Illinois 
Third Congressional District community.
  Born in our great City of Chicago on April 21, 1962, to Benito and 
Mirta Ortiz, Oscar dedicated his life to empowering our community 
through education. He believed that education was a powerful tool to 
build a just future. He knew education could unlock our collective 
potential and enable us to realize our dreams. With that in mind, Ortiz 
became an elementary and high school teacher, helping our young people 
find their power and joy in learning. Whether it was at Jahn and Lowell 
Elementary Schools or Jefferson Alternative School, el maestro Ortiz 
was always present for all his students, their parents, and faculty.
  His desire to serve our community and defend public education in 
Chicago led him to join the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) in May 2003, 
where he quickly became a committed and active member, never missing a 
meeting or event. There, Oscar served as a sergeant-at-arms, as the 
Lowell delegate, and as a member of the Legislative Committees, always 
with the intention of advancing social justice and equity through 
education.
  Oscar generously committed his time on earth to countless social 
justice causes. He believed in the power of organized communities and 
worked tirelessly to build a better future for Chicago and our nation. 
I, personally, will miss his calls to action and the way he could stir 
our passions and stoke our courage on the bullhorn at direct actions. 
May his passion for change and love of community always--guide us! I 
will miss him dearly, and I know that countless others will, too. He 
was a true, loyal friend.
  His wife, Sabina; sons, Gabriel and Daniel; brother Ed; parents, 
Benito and Mirta; all his loved ones, and to the entire CTU family, are 
in my heart and in my prayers. Together, as we mourn his passing, let 
us celebrate the blessing he was in all of our lives, the impact he had 
on our community, and the mark he has left in our great City of 
Chicago. Oscar vive, la lucha sigue. Rest in power, Oscar.

  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I was serving as Ranking Member in 
the House Financial Services Committee on November 29 when votes were 
called on the House Floor. The Chairman did not recess the committee in 
time for me to make the first vote of the series, therefore I missed 
recording my vote on Roll Call No. 678.
  Had I been able to vote, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 678.

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Wrightstown 
Tigers Football Team for their runner-up finish at the 2023 WIAA 
Division 5 State Boys Football Championship.
  Following an impressive season and playoff run, the Wrightstown 
football team traveled to Camp Randall in Madison to compete in the 
2023 WIAA State Football Championship Game. With a record of 11-3 
during the season, the Wrightstown team worked together all season to 
become a dominant force in the conference. I commend head coach Steve 
Klister, the coaching staff, and the entire team for their unwavering 
commitment and dedication to an incredibly impressive season.
  This being their first trip to the state championship since 2011, the 
entire team and community have much for which they should be proud. 
Although they lost a tough battle to a talented La Crosse Aquinas team, 
the team displayed great skill and determination throughout the season. 
Congratulations to the entire team for this remarkable achievement, and 
a special congratulations to the senior players on the team: Riley 
Verbeten, Quade Thompson, Payton Vande Hey, Kevin Biese, Riley Sundin, 
Landon Helphrey, Elijah Lemke, Ben Zemple, Sam Keuler, Charlie Garvey, 
Trent Vande Hey, Garrett Hitner, Brendan Gustafson, Carter Lamers, 
Everett Lamers, and Gavin Ducat.
  Mr. Speaker, I extend my sincere congratulations to head coach Steve 
Klister and the entire Wrightstown Football Team for his outstanding 
accomplishment. It is my honor to recognize this team and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in applauding their remarkable season.

                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate my 
Legislative Director and Counsel, Julian Johnson, and his wife 
Agnieszka Johnson (nee Dziadek), on the birth of their first child. It 
was my honor to officiate the couple&#x27;s wedding on October 22, 2016, and 
now I am delighted that their family continues to expand.


 =========================== NOTE =========================== 

  
  On December 5, 2023, page E1169, in the third column, the 
following appeared: Agnieszka Johnson (ne Dziadek), on the birth 
of their first child. It was my honor to officiate
  
  The online version has been corrected to read: Agnieszka Johnson 
(nee Dziadek), on the birth of their first child. It was my honor 
to officiate


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  Damian Scipio Johnson was born at 4:14 a.m. on Sunday, October 8, 
2023, in Washington, D.C., and he is quite possibly the cutest baby the 
hospital has ever seen. His given names represent strength and an 
indomitable spirit. Damian is a dual citizen by birth, and he will 
always have a home in the United States and in Poland.
  I have known Julian since 2009 and have long valued his contributions 
over the years to my office and to the people of the Second 
Congressional District of Georgia. He is an integral member of my team 
and champion for the American people, and I continue observing with 
great pride what the future holds for him both personally and 
professionally.
  My wife Vivian and I give our best wishes to Julian and Agnieszka, 
their respective families, and their own growing family.
