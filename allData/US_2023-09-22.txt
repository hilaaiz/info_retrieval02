                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 22, 2023

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Courtney 
Dauwalter, a remarkable ultrarunner and Leadville resident who 
continues to redefine the boundaries of endurance in the world of 
ultra-distance racing.
  In July 2023, Ms. Dauwalter achieved the remarkable feat of being the 
first female finisher at the grueling Hardrock 100-mile foot race, only 
a few weeks after she emerged victorious at the Western States 100 in 
California. She also won the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, a race renowned 
for its extreme difficulty and terrain. With this victory, she made 
history, becoming the first person ever to win all 3 of these races in 
a single year and the second person ever to achieve this incredible 
trifecta in their lifetime.
  Ms. Dauwalter&#x27;s unparalleled accomplishments serve as an inspiration 
to all, demonstrating that with grit and dedication, one can achieve 
the seemingly impossible. We wish Ms. Dauwalter the best of luck as she 
continues her running career and inspires fellow athletes and fans in 
Colorado and around the world.

the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Office for Democratic Institutions and

    HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND LEGACY OF JOHN ``JACK&#x27;&#x27; HARRINGTON 
                             COSTELLO, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. LORI TRAHAN

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 22, 2023

  Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the tremendous 
contributions and legacy of John ``Jack&#x27;&#x27; Harrington Costello, Jr., a 
successful publisher and editor of the Lowell Sun and a beloved 
community leader who dedicated his life to the prosperity of my 
hometown, the city of Lowell and its community. He passed away 
peacefully on August 28, 2023.
  Jack was born in Lowell in 1944. After graduating from Keith Academy 
in 1963, Jack would go on to study business at Boston College. He then 
attended Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island where he 
would later graduate and proudly serve his country as a Lieutenant in 
the United States Navy from 1967 to 1970.
  After the Navy, Jack returned to his hometown of Lowell where he 
embarked on a 3 decades-long professional career at his cherished 
family-founded local paper, The Lowell Sun. Jack got his start as a 
sports writer before quickly moving up through the ranks to sports 
editor, to editor, and ultimately taking his destined position as the 
Sun&#x27;s publisher. He was known for his integrity, persistence, 
decisiveness, and ability to extract the best out of his employees and 
those around him. The Sun thrived under Jack&#x27;s leadership due to his 
mission of keeping the paper hyperlocal, so residents were always 
informed of what was happening in their community. Over the span of his 
career, Jack carefully curated a local paper that was dedicated to 
delivering accurate and relevant news to the Greater Lowell area.
  When he wasn&#x27;t working tirelessly to ensure the Sun ran smoothly, 
Jack was involved in the revitalization of his hometown. His expertise 
and vision for the future of the City made him a trusted confidant to 
many business and political leaders over the years. He served as 
Chairman of the Lowell Memorial Auditorium, which welcomed many 
talented artists to perform at the venue under his stewardship. Jack 
also served as Chairman of the Tsongas Arena Commission and was 
instrumental in the arena&#x27;s creation. In addition to these 
accomplishments, he is also responsible for helping to bring 
professional hockey and baseball teams to Lowell for the community to 
enjoy. Jack&#x27;s contributions to Lowell have made a lasting impact on the 
city and will continue to be felt for generations to come.
  Jack will be remembered for his love for his family and friends, his 
kindness to those around him, his distinguished professional career, 
and his immense pride in the City of Lowell. My heart goes out to 
Brenda, his loving wife of 54 years, his children, John III, Peter, 
Nicole, and Suzanne, and the entire Costello family during this 
difficult time. Jack&#x27;s legacy will live on through his loving family 
and all of us who had the honor of knowing him.

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Trevonni Rossi 
from Canon City for his acceptance into the Juilliard Summer Dance

  Mrs. McLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female 
leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as 
``Christian Women of Distinction&#x27;&#x27; by She Leads America.
  While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in 
Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics 
for role models. Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired 
by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering 
dedication to their communities. Today, I am proud to honor some of the 
women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought 
great inspiration to many throughout the world.
  As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and 
constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the 
defense of religious freedom. Now more than ever, we must safeguard 
religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I

[[Page E882]]

serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
  One of the women honored by She Leads America, Charmaine Hedding, is 
a global development manager in the non-profit sector. In this role, 
she focuses on the protection of Christians and other minorities in the 
Middle East and Africa. A fierce proponent of religious freedom, she 
has also assisted in many humanitarian projects, including the 
evacuation of over 9,000 people from Afghanistan. Today, she also 
consults for government agencies, authorities, and faith-based 
organizations.
  Mr. Speaker, these women, including Charmaine, have left an indelible 
mark on countless lives. They are pioneers whose examples have--and 
will continue to--inspire many. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each 
of them for their unwavering dedication. This honor is truly well-
deserved.

Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics 
for role models. Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired 
by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering 
dedication to their communities. Today, I am proud to honor some of the 
women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought 
great inspiration to many throughout the world.
  As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and 
constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the 
defense of religious freedom. Now more than ever, we must safeguard 
religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve 
never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
  One of the women honored by She Leads America, Lori Windham, is vice 
president and senior counsel at Becket. In this capacity, Lori proudly 
defends religious freedom before the United States Supreme Court. Her 
work in Fulton v. Philadelphia, as well as in Becket&#x27;s Hobby Lobby and 
Little Sisters of the Poor victories, has protected many from religious 
discrimination. Lori is a renowned expert on religious freedom and in 
First Amendment Law and has testified before U.S. Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, these women, including Lori, have left an indelible mark 
on countless lives. They are pioneers whose examples have--and will 
continue to--inspire many. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each of 
them for their unwavering dedication. This honor is truly well-
deserved.

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female 
leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as 
``Christian Women of Distinction&#x27;&#x27; by She Leads America.

  One of the women honored by She Leads America, Sharon Daughterty, 
founded Victory Christian Center in 1981 alongside her husband. After 
his passing, Sharon served as the lead pastor for five years. Over 
time, Victory thrived and developed into a large church community with 
a K-12 school, Bible School, camp, and a community center. This church 
has also planted over 2,000 Bible Colleges in 102 countries and has 
played a supportive role in missions across the globe.

  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF MRS. ETHELYN SZAD BELL OF BONHAM, 
                                 TEXAS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. PAT FALLON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 22, 2023

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday 
of Mrs. Ethelyn Szad Bell of Bonham, Texas. Mrs. Bell served in the 
United States Army Nurse Corps in the Second World War and will turn 
100 years old on October 4, 2023.
  Mrs. Bell was born in Wallingford, Connecticut on October 4, 1923, to 
Charles and Gertrude Szad. As the Second World War raged on, Mrs. Bell 
heard President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s appeal to the Nation for 
additional hospital staff, so she enlisted in the United States Army on 
March 26, 1945. She completed basic training for Army nurses at Fort 
Devens, Massachusetts, and set sail to the Philippines with the Army 
Nurse Corps on the hospital ship USAHS Charles A. Stafford. During this 
time, Mrs. Bell provided care for wounded soldiers in a tent city 
within the Philippine jungles. She later transferred to Nagoya, Japan, 
and tended to American GIs in a converted hospital. For her service and 
efforts, Second Lieutenant Bell was awarded a citation from President 
Harry S. Truman, and she was honorably discharged on June 19, 1946.
  After the Army, Mrs. Bell worked at the Veterans Administration 
Hospital in McKinney, Texas. In 1947, she met her husband, fellow Army 
veteran Charles Bell, on a blind date. They married a year later on 
October 16, 1948, and moved to Prosper, Texas. Together, they raised 2 
children, Tom and Cindy. Mrs. Bell later worked as a school nurse at 
the North Ward and West Ward Elementary Schools in McKinney until her 
retirement in 1978. In her free time, she enjoys traveling and visiting 
casinos. I am honored to commemorate Mrs. Bell today on reaching her 
centennial.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capital to recognize Mrs. Bell&#x27;s remarkable journey and service to our 
Nation. May God bless Mrs. Bell as we celebrate 100 years of life and 
joy.

             RECOGNIZING THE TRINITY LOVE HOBLIT FOUNDATION

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. AARON BEAN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 22, 2023

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, did you know that September is 
national Brain Aneurysm Awareness month?
  The Trinity Love Hoblit Foundation certainly does. The Foundation is 
a nonprofit, headquartered in Florida and named after Trinity, who at 
age 9 was diagnosed with multiple brain aneurysms. In 2015, Trinity was 
scheduled for open brain surgery but passed away 2 days prior because 
her aneurysm ruptured.
  About 1 in 50 Americans have an unruptured brain aneurysm. Brain 
aneurysms are more common and harmful than people know.
  Mr. Speaker, while her passing was a tragic loss for our community, 
The Trinity Love Hoblit Foundation honors her legacy through raising 
awareness, supporting research, and identifying training for brain 
aneurysms at Wolfson&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital and Baptist Neurological 
Institute in Jacksonville, Florida.

  I thank the Trinity Love Hoblit team for all they do.

      TEXAS-24 HOMETOWN HEROES ELIZABETH PICKETT AND NOELLE DORGAN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETH VAN DUYNE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 22, 2023

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 
Hometown Heroes, Elizabeth Pickett and Noelle Dorgan. Over the summer, 
when a woman dialed 9-1-1 as her husband experienced a cardiac event, 
Elizabeth and Noelle stepped up to help save a life. As Emergency 
Communications Specialists for the Grapevine Police Department, they 
successfully guided the caller through the steps of CPR. Thanks to the 
clear instructions of these first responders and the caller&#x27;s immediate 
action, the patient was able to be saved once paramedics arrived. 
Recently, Elizabeth and Noelle earned well-deserved recognition from 
the Grapevine Fire Department for their heroic efforts. Their composure 
amidst this intense situation was the difference between life and 
death. I want to thank both Elizabeth and Noelle for their dedication 
to serving the community and their efforts to tend to the safety and 
health of Texas-24.
