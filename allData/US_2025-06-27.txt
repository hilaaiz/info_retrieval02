I rise today to recognize a truly special 
milestone for my district: 100 years since the incorporation of 
Deerfield Beach, Florida.
  What started in June 1925 as a town of just 500 people has boomed 
into a vibrant city and one of the best places to live in South 
Florida. Deerfield Beach is special not just because of its natural 
beauty, but also because of the people who have built this city up for 
the past century and make it what it is today.
  Im proud to represent parts of Deerfield Beach, and Im fortunate to 
work with Mayor Todd Drosky and its local commissioners to deliver the 
federal resources this city needs to support its infrastructure, boost 
its economic development, and keep families here safe. It is truly an 
incredible place to call home.
, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in wishing a 
happy 100th birthday to the City of Deerfield Beach. I look forward to 
what this next century brings for this community and its residents.
on this 27th day in the month of June in 
the year 2025, we recognize Mark Ratner of Battle Creek, Michigan, for 
concluding his time on Capitol Hill after more than 20 years of 
outstanding service to the American people in the United States House 
of Representatives.
  Ratners career in public service has been marked by a steadfast 
commitment to the people of Michigan and the nation. A proud graduate 
of Michigan State University, Ratner began his journey serving Michigan

Deputy Chief of Staff was instrumental in advancing critical 
legislative priorities, particularly in the field of healthcare, where 
his expertise and dedication helped shape policies that improved the 
lives of countless Americans.
  Ratner further distinguished himself by bringing his wealth of 
experience and steady hand to the office of Wisconsin Congressman Bryan 
Steil, where he served as Chief of Staff. His contributions extended 
beyond Michigan and Wisconsin, including his service with Louisiana 
Senator Bill Cassidy, reflecting a career dedicated to principled 
governance.
  Throughout his decades of service, Ratner has been known for his 
tireless work ethic, his keen understanding of complex policy matters, 
and his unwavering integrity. His efforts, especially in healthcare 
policy, have left an indelible impact on the legislative process and 
have helped ensure that the voices of his constituents were heard and 
represented with honor and diligence.
  As Ratner concludes his exceptional career in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for his many years 
of faithful service. His dedication has set a standard of excellence in 
public service, and his contributions will continue to benefit the 
American people for years to come.
  We wish Ratner all the best in his future endeavors and thank him for 
his extraordinary commitment to our country. Go Green.
I rise to celebrate Shirley 
Smith Southerlands 90th Birthday on July 26, 2025. Shirley Smith 
Southerland was born in Wallace, North Carolina in 1935, and is a 
mother of 4 children, 1 boy and 3 girls. She was an award-winning 
hairdresser before working for Princess House Inc., becoming one of its 
top five independent sales managers in the country. Known as ``Yaya 
by her 21 grandchildren and great grandchildren, she is a devoted and 
loving grandmother. We celebrate her this month as a shining example of 
a civic-minded American--through her service dedication, hard work, 
respect for others, and active participation in democracy. She shows us 
what it means to be a model citizen.
today, I rise to recognize Don Johnson for 
his decades of dedicated service in the nonprofit sector and his 
impactful tenure as President and CEO of Goodwill Industries of Central 
Illinois. In this role, Johnson led the organization to expand 
workforce development efforts and launched new initiatives aimed at 
supporting some of the most vulnerable populations in Central Illinois.
  Johnson earned his Bachelor of Science from Eastern Illinois 
University and a Master of Science from Western Illinois University. 
Before joining Goodwill in 2016, he served as Executive Director of the 
Hult Center for Healthy Living and as Vice President of Community 
Investments at the Heart of Illinois United Way. In those roles, he 
championed data-driven community investments, built expansive volunteer 
networks, and led public health and education initiatives, including 
211, Success by Six, and Supporting Student Access.
  During Johnsons tenure at Goodwill, the organization broadened its 
mission beyond traditional job training and donation-based stores. 
Under his leadership, Goodwill introduced innovative programs that 
supported children and families at risk of violence and created a new 
job placement program for neurodivergent young adults. One of his 
biggest projects being the expansion of the General Wayne A. Downing 
Home for Veterans, which helped raise nearly $1.5 million for the 
strengthening of services for local veterans.
  Don Johnsons tireless leadership and commitment to the non-profit 
sector has left a lasting impact on Central Illinois. His work has 
advanced economic opportunity, human dignity, and community well-being. 
I congratulate Don on his retirement and wish him, his wife Kim, and 
their two daughters all the best in this next chapter of life.
I rise today to recognize my friend, Ms. 
Betty Doster, for her dedicated service to The University of North 
Carolina at Charlotte, my alma mater, as Special Assistant to the 
Chancellor for External Relations and Partnerships.
  After nearly fifteen years in this important position, Betty 
announced her retirement, with her last day being Monday, June 30, 
2025. Throughout her many years of service, Betty played an 
immeasurable role in the growth of UNC Charlotte into an R1 research 
institution. Even though she is a proud UNC Chapel Hill alum, Bettys 
passion for UNC Charlotte was enormous. Her efforts significantly 
contributed to the growing influence of our universjty across the state 
of North Carolina, around the country and around the world. It was a 
pleasure to work with Betty on many of these initiatives over the 
years.
  As Special Assistant to the Chancellor for External Relations and 
Partnerships, Betty worked closely with federal, state, and local 
officials, as well as economic development partners to secure important 
public investments for the University. Bettys efforts helped acquire 
major student-focused initiatives, including authorization for the 
University Recreation Center, expansion of the Collegiate Recovery 
Program, and support for UNC Charlottes esports initiative.
  It is my honor to take this opportunity to recognize Ms. Betty Doster 
for her incredible service to UNC Charlotte, and her significant impact 
on the University. While Ill miss working with Betty and discussing 
the 49ers, I wish her all the best in her next adventure and hope she 
will be able to enjoy more time with friends and family.
, please join me today in honoring my friend, Ms. Betty 
Doster, for her nearly 15 years of dedicated service to UNC Charlotte 
and the lasting impact she made on the university and everyone she met 
along the way.
I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated 
public safety professional who was taken from us much too soon. Metro 
Transit Police Lieutenant Beverly Rodriguez was just 40 years old when 
she died on Sunday, June 22, 2025, in a tragic accident. Her death is a 
deep and profound loss for her family, especially her two sons Macallen 
and Macody, the Metro Transit Police Department, and our entire east 
metro community.
, posthumously and deservingly promoted to Lieutenant on 
June 23, 2025, served as a Metro Transit police officer for more than 
eight years. Lieutenant Rodriguez was a compassionate leader who served 
as head of the Homeless Action Team (HAT), building real relationships 
with those experiencing homelessness and personally guiding hundreds 
toward housing stability and hope. In addition to her police duties, 
Lieutenant Rodriguez served as Northern Vice President of the National 
Latino Peace Officers Association, where she was described as ``a 
compassionate advocate, a trusted mentor, and a tireless servant.
  I extend my deepest condolences to Lieutenant Rodriguezs family, 
friends, and colleagues. Her heroic works will never be forgotten.
I rise to honor a remarkable public 
servant, leader, and civil rights trailblazer, Pastor Warren Stewart, 
Sr., on the occasion of his retirement as Senior Pastor at Arizonas 
First Institutional Baptist Church.
  God called Pastor Stewart to Arizona 48 years ago, and he has been 
speaking truth to power in the state ever since. Each Sunday, Pastor 
Stewarts sermons and service work inspired Arizonans to better their 
community and uplift their neighbors. From the helm of Phoenixs oldest 
African American Baptist church, Pastor Stewart used his platform to 
advance justice and civil rights across our state. His guiding 
principle: Jesus and Justice work together.
  His advocacy is well illustrated by the battle to establish Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Day as a state holiday. By 1992, Arizona was the last 
state refusing to recognize MLK Day, despite the federal holiday being 
signed into law nearly a decade prior. Pastor Stewart fought to correct 
this, leading multiple movements to get the holiday initiative on the 
ballot. He mobilized coalitions across political spectrums, religions, 
and cultural backgrounds to come together to win this historic, long 
overdue vote.
  As the longest-serving leader of the First Institutional Baptist 
Church, Pastor Stewart has traveled extensively, preaching in 39 states 
and territories and 60 countries, and has received many accolades for 
his contributions to our community and beyond. Following the teachings 
of the Gospel, his work always focused on the poorest and neediest: 
immigrants, unsheltered people and veterans, and those suffering from 
mental health issues.
  Pastor Stewart and the Church turned Christian values into action. 
FIBCO Family Services, Samaritan House for Homeless Families, Ujima 
House for Unwed Teenage Mothers and their Infants, and the Broadway 
House, all created under Pastor Stewart, minister to those most in need 
of compassion and care. FIBCO has become a hallmark in Phoenixs 
nonprofit scene and has even taken their mission abroad, expanding 
across Africa.
  Pastor Stewarts impressive academic and public service record led to 
roles as Chair of the National Immigration Forum and President of 
American Baptist Churches of the Pacific Southwest. He was proclaimed a 
``State History Maker by the Arizona Historical Society. Under 
unanimous direction of the Phoenix City Council, the street in front of 
the First Institutional Baptist Church was renamed ``Dr. Warren H. 
Stewart Way.
  Today, all of Arizona congratulates our very own ``living legend on 
his well-deserved retirement. Pastor Stewarts career and contributions 
have cemented him as one of Arizonas greatest religious leaders.
  I have personally been blessed to know him as a friend and trusted 
advisor. Hell be the first to tell you he couldnt have enjoyed such a 
long career without the love and support of his wife, Reverend Dr. 
Karen Stewart, and their children and grandchildren. We thank the 
entire Stewart family for sharing him with us.
  I thank Pastor Stewart for his decades of service to our community, 
and may your quest for moral justice continue in your next chapter. 
Godspeed.
I rise today with great 
pride and deep respect to honor the life and remarkable public service 
of Mississippi State Senator David L. Jordan--a man whose journey from 
the cotton fields of Leflore County to the Mississippi State Capitol is 
not just inspiring--its the story of Mississippi, and of America at 
its best.
  Senator Jordan was born in rural Leflore County Mississippi, the 
youngest of five children in a sharecropping family. He began working 
in the cotton fields as soon as he was big enough to carry a sack. Like 
so many children in that era, he missed a lot of school during harvest 
season. But even then, young David knew education was the key to 
something more. And he never stopped pushing toward it.
  He worked nights washing dishes at a Holiday Inn while putting 
himself through Mississippi Valley State University and later earned a 
masters degree in chemistry from the University of Wyoming. That kind 
of grit--working all night, studying all day--is something we dont 
talk about enough in politics. But thats the kind of man Senator 
Jordan is.
  He began his professional life as a science teacher, but his heart 
was always with the community. In 1985, he made history as the first 
African American elected to the Greenwood City Council, where he served 
with quiet strength and fierce dedication for 36 years. He became a 
trusted leader, someone people turned to for guidance and fairness, no 
matter the issue.
  In 1993, he was elected to the Mississippi State Senate, representing 
District 24. For over three decades, Senator Jordan has been a powerful 
voice for his consituents--a calm presence in moments of tension, a 
mentor to

younger legislators, and a relentless advocate for civil rights, public 
health, education, and voting access.
  And he didnt just talk the talk--he marched, boycotted, organized, 
and educated. He helped people understand how to vote, how to be heard, 
and how to stand up for their communities. Hes led with humility, 
wisdom, and a deep love for the people of Mississippi.
  Now at 92 years old, Senator Jordan is preparing to conclude his 
official duties on June 30, but his legacy will not end there. He lives 
in Greenwood, Mississippi, with his wife, Christine Bell-Jordan, his 
partner in life and service.
  Senator Jordan once said, ``I didnt stop there. I just kept on 
pushing. That simple sentence says everything about him. He kept 
pushing--for himself, for his community, and for justice. He is the 
kind of public servant we should all strive to be.
  His memoir, From the Mississippi Cotton Fields to the State Senate, 
tells the full story of his journey. Its a powerful reminder of what 
is possible when courage and commitment meet opportunity.
, on behalf of a grateful state and Nation, I thank 
Senator David L. Jordan, not just for what he accomplished, but for how 
he did it. With integrity. With purpose. With heart.
HONORING THE NASWA RESORTS ANNIVERSARY AND THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF HOPE 
                            of new hampshire
I rise today in honor of the NASWA Resorts 
anniversary and in memory of their dedicated owner, Hope Markis.
  The NASWA Resort is one of the Lakes Regions most iconic 
establishments, founded by Greek immigrants and its legacy carried on 
by their daughter, Hope Markis, and her family. Starting as just a few 
cabins, the Markis family has transformed the NASWA Resort into the 
hospitable and beautiful place it is today. Over the years, they have 
grown their business from an inn to the resort we know, expanding to 
include more options for entertainment, food, and adventure.
  Hope Markis was truly a leader, through both her work in pioneering 
the resort and her active involvement in her community. Her legacy 
truly lives in her hospitality and generosity, whether that was in the 
way she welcomed guests to the resort or in her support of veterans and 
first responders. The way that she cared for her community will not be 
forgotten, and that care lives on in her children and grandchildren, 
who continue to run the NASWA Resort. Certainly, what she has built as 
a businesswoman and as a matriarch will be felt by all of those who 
come to the resort and experience her hard work and dedication.
  The NASWA Resort is not just an important piece of New Hampshires 
tourist economy, but a multigenerational family business that is a 
vital part of the Lakes Region. New Hampshire owes Hope and her family 
a debt of gratitude for all that they have brought to the region and 
the work they have done to better the community around them.
  On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshires First Congressional 
District, I share my condolences with the Markis family, including her 
children and her grandchildren. I would once again like to extend my 
condolences to her family and wish them all the very best in this time 
of grieving.
I rise today to draw attention to a critical 
and escalating threat to our environment and economy, invasive species, 
and to ask for support of my proposed Invasive Species Response Act.
  Invasive species jeopardize the delicate balance of our ecosystems, 
as they can outcompete, prey on or introduce diseases to our native 
flora and fauna. The consequences of these disruptions are severe, 
leading to declines in biodiversity, diminishing the resilience of our 
ecosystems in the face of environmental change.
  Beyond ecological damage, invasive species impose billions in 
economic costs each year. They harm agriculture, forestry, fisheries 
and tourism by reducing crop yields, damaging forests, disrupting 
marine ecosystems and degrading natural landscapes that communities and 
industries rely on.
  In Hawaii, this threat is especially urgent. Hawaiis isolation has 
led to the evolution of many endemic species that are found nowhere 
else on Earth. Unfortunately, these native species often lack the 
defenses to compete with or resist the pressures of invasive plants and 
animals, which can rapidly alter ecosystems and displace local species. 
In Hawaii, invasive species have caused significant ecological damage, 
threatening the survival of native birds and plants. Protecting 
Hawaiis unique biodiversity is not just an environmental necessity; it 
is a cultural imperative that reflects the identity and heritage of the 
Hawaiian people.
  Invasive species are also not just a localized problem; they pose a 
significant threat to the integrity of our natural world. Addressing 
this crisis requires a coordinated and comprehensive approach, focusing 
on prevention, early detection and effective management strategies to 
safeguard our vulnerable ecosystems.
  In response to this urgent need, I am jointly introducing the 
Invasive Species Response Act with my colleague, Congressman Jim Moylan 
of Guam. This legislation will codify the existing Invasive Species 
Strike Teams program currently operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service (FWS). These specialized teams play an essential role in 
managing emerging invasive species, employing strategies tailored to 
local conditions across the National Wildlife Refuge System. With 21 
teams strategically positioned in various FWS regions, they are on the 
front lines, addressing the unique challenges posed by invasive 
species.
  The Invasive Species Response Act signifies a transformative shift 
within the FWS, moving us from a reactive, species-by-species approach 
to a more strategic, system-wide framework for managing emerging 
invasive species. Key provisions of the bill include formally 
establishing the Invasive Species Strike Teams program, which will 
create a stable and legally supported framework to ensure consistent 
funding and enhance our management efforts. The act also mandates 
enhanced coordination and reporting through integrated systems and 
standardized procedures, ensuring transparency and enabling us to track 
progress with annual reports to Congress and the public. Furthermore, 
it authorizes $15 million annually from Fiscal Year 2025 through 2029, 
aligning with current FWS investment levels to support ongoing 
initiatives.
  This legislation is a crucial step forward in protecting our natural 
resources and enhancing our capacity to respond swiftly to the threats 
posed by invasive species.
  I urge my colleagues to lend their support to our Invasive Species 
Response Act. Together, we can ensure the preservation of our 
ecosystems and promote a resilient future for our environment.
had I been present, I would have voted NAY on 
Roll Call No. 183, and NAY on Roll Call No. 184.
I rise today to honor Barbara 
Collura, a long-time advocate for family-building equality, who is 
stepping down after more than 20 years of leadership with RESOLVE: The 
National Infertility Association.
  During her tenure, Barbaras leadership was key to furthering 
RESOLVEs missions: lifting up the voices of millions of Americans 
struggling with infertility and fighting to ensure that everyone, 
regardless of background, income, or geography, can access the care 
they need to build their families.
  Her work included testifying before Congress, meeting with lawmakers 
and federal agencies, organizing advocates, and working toward a world 
where infertility is recognized as a disease that deserves attention, 
compassion, and coverage.
  Her tenure has been marked by meaningful policy progress, including 
expanded insurance coverage for fertility care at the state level, and 
increased protections for IVF.
  As someone who relied on access to IVF to have my twins, I know 
personally how important it is to raise more awareness about 
infertility and expand access to fertility treatments. I have been 
proud to work with RESOLVE under Barbaras leadership to push for 
common sense legislation that would offer hope to millions of families 
struggling with infertility.
  At a time when reproductive freedom is under attack, Barbara has 
stood firm in defense of all paths to parenthood--because infertility 
is not only part of the reproductive health conversation, but central 
to it.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Barbara Collura for her 
extraordinary contributions to the infertility community. Her legacy is 
one of hope, progress, and an unwavering commitment to the idea that 
everyone deserves the chance to build a family.
it is my privilege to recognize 
and celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the City of Coleman, Florida. 
While unofficial records indicate that Coleman was first incorporated 
under general laws on June 20, 1908, it was in 1925 that the city 
officially received its charter, thus marking the beginning of its 
formal governance and development.
  Coleman was first settled in 1882 by pioneers who farmed the fertile 
lands of the Warm Springs Hammock. The Florida Gazette of 1886-1887 
listed Dr. B.F. Coleman, a physician and one of the areas earliest 
settlers, as the towns namesake.
  Many early settlers came from nearby Adamsville, which had flourished 
through orange cultivation until the devastating freeze of 1894 through 
1895. That natural disaster forced many to seek new livelihoods, and 
Coleman soon emerged as a center of diverse agricultural production. In 
addition to citrus, settlers in Coleman raised cotton, cattle, sheep, 
and hogs, with wool even shipped to Baltimore for processing. By 1923, 
Coleman had earned national recognition as the ``Cabbage Capital of the 
World, attracting buyers from across the country.
  Today, the City of Coleman is in the heart of Sumter County and is 
home to approximately 700 residents. The city retains its Old Florida 
charm, with a quiet rural character and deep historical roots. As we 
commemorate this centennial milestone, we honor the generations who 
have shaped Colemans legacy as a city built on resilience, 
agriculture, and a deep sense of community.
  Happy Centennial to the City of Coleman.
