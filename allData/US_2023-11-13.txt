          COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF FLORENCE ``FROSTY&#x27;&#x27; TAYLOR

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PAUL A. GOSAR

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2023

  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of a 
fellow patriot and beloved editor of the Republican Briefs, Mrs. 
Florence ``Frosty&#x27;&#x27; Taylor.
  Two weeks ago, Arizona lost a dear friend. With two beautiful 
children, two grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and a husband 
of 68 years, Frosty lived a life full of love, service, and passion for 
adventure. She would never lie idle when there was more work to be done 
for our country.
  Born on April 7, 1937, Frosty grew up on her grandfather&#x27;s cattle 
ranch in South Dakota and married her high school sweetheart. In 1964, 
she won the Mrs. Nebraska pageant and subsequently embarked on a career 
in public media. Beginning as a columnist, she quickly advanced to the 
position of editor and earned the titles of first female reporter to 
ride in a Phoenix Police helicopter and honorary Phoenix firefighter.
  After great success in the media industry, Frosty worked in the 
Arizona Attorney General&#x27;s office and the Arizona Game and Fish 
Department Heritage Fund.
  But Frosty&#x27;s true service was performed within her community. She 
served as President of the Wickenburg Republican Club and was one of 
her district&#x27;s precinct committeewomen and state committeeman, while 
reporting Arizona news as editor of the Republican Briefs, a role from 
which she retired only this past August.
  She had a thirst for knowledge, but not for her own benefit. Whether 
it was working for the media or humbly publishing a 500-page family 
cookbook, Frosty strived to share all she learned with others.
  Every time we met, she amazed me. She knew politics through and 
through, from the local to the national level. If you visit the 
Republican Briefs website, you will find countless testimonies to 
Frosty&#x27;s advocacy on behalf of Arizonan Conservatives.
  On November 4, 2023, Frosty passed away at the vivacious age of 86. 
Although this is a time of mourning, her life and legacy will be 
celebrated for years to come.
  She will be remembered as a woman of principle, but most of all, a 
long-time supporter and friend of mine. When you have a friend in 
Frosty, you have a friend indeed.

                          ____________________

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF BRADLEY UNIVERSITY&#x27;S MEN&#x27;S SOCCER HEAD COACH 
                               JIM DEROSE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DARIN LaHOOD

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2023

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Jim 
DeRose on his retirement as Bradley University&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Soccer Coach 
after 28 successful seasons.
  Beginning his career in 1996 at the age of 28 as the youngest coach 
in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s soccer, Jim quickly emerged as a dominant 
figure in the soccer community. Jim guided the Braves to the regular-
season Missouri Valley Conference title in 1998, followed by the 
program&#x27;s first NCAA Tournament appearance in 2000. Under Jim&#x27;s 
leadership, Bradley&#x27;s soccer program reached new heights and resulted 
in a 2007 run to the NCAA Elite Eight, where Jim was chosen as the 
Soccer America National Coach of the Year.
  Jim&#x27;s record speaks volumes of his commitment and dedication to the 
game. During his tenure as head coach, Bradley held a 267-227-66 record 
with seven NCAA tournament appearances, the highest for any coach in 
Bradley University Athletics history. Jim finishes his career as the 
second-winningest coach in Missouri Valley Conference soccer history 
and coached the only four-year all-Americans in MVC men&#x27;s soccer 
history.
  In addition to his accomplishments on the pitch, the accomplishments 
of his players in the classroom and post-graduation are a testament to 
his ability to grow his players into successful young men. Six former 
assistant coaches have gone on to become NCAA Division I head coaches, 
sixteen players have been selected for all-American academic awards, 
and nine have been selected in the Major League Soccer SuperDraft.
  Jim has been an integral part of growing the game of soccer 
throughout central Illinois and his legacy will last for years to come. 
It is my privilege to congratulate Jim DeRose on his retirement after 
28 years with Bradley University Men&#x27;s Soccer and wish him, his wife 
Robin, and his two children, Raleigh and J.R., all the best.

    INTRODUCTION OF THE BUSINESS UNINTERRUPTED MONETARY PROGRAM ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2023

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Business 
Uninterrupted Monetary Program Act of 2023 (BUMP Act). This crucial 
piece of legislation provides essential funding to businesses and 
nonprofits that have been directly and measurably fInancially impacted 
by major transportation projects, with the goal of keeping them 
solvent.
  With major transit and highway projects planned across the country, 
the livelihoods and survival of some local businesses may be at risk 
because of construction disruptions that impede customers&#x27; access to 
their store fronts.

[[Page E1095]]

In my own district, on the heels of closures caused by the COVID 
pandemic, a major transit project prevented customers from accessing 
stores in downtown Santa Ana, CA for months. Many of those businesses 
struggled to pay their rent and utility bills, pay for their inventory, 
and some had to close permanently as a result. Efforts to help the 
businesses, such as signage, failed. What they needed were financial 
resources. What happened in my district can happen anywhere in America, 
in any downtown. We can and need to do more to minimize the economic 
damage inflicted on local businesses from projects that receive federal 
transportation monies.
  The legislation will require local sponsors to create a BUMP fund 
that provides financial assistance for local entities that will 
experience a measurable interruption causing negative financial impact 
from the project. The fund can cover utilities, insurance, rent or 
mortgage, payroll, loss of income, and any other expense that the 
sponsor determines is needed for the impacted businesses. Importantly, 
the local sponsors who know the local community and best understand the 
impacts of the project create and manage the BUMP fund. The local 
sponsor further determines how much to contribute to the fund, how the 
fund is structured, which entities are eligible for funding, and what 
type of expenses should be covered.
  The requirement to create a BUMP fund only applies to highway 
projects with a total cost equal or greater than $50 million and 
transit projects with a total cost equal or greater to $100 million 
with measurable negative financial impacts on local businesses and 
nonprofits. The bill also creates a one-time grant opportunity for 
businesses and nonprofits that are currently struggling financially 
from an interruption created by a major transportation project.
  It is important to America&#x27;s economy that local businesses can 
continue to serve our communities after completion of transportation 
projects. I am introducing this legislation to make sure no other 
business is forced to face financial turmoil or close due to an 
interruption caused by a major transportation project. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in supporting this crucial initiative, allowing 
our Nation&#x27;s vibrant local economies to stay afloat during the 
construction of major infrastructure projects and reap the benefits of 
these transit and highway projects upon their completion.

    INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD FEDERAL 
                      EMPLOYEE LEAVE FAIRNESS ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia 
National Guard Federal Employee Leave Fairness Act, which would 
prohibit the Department of Defense (DOD) from recouping pay from 
District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) members who

[[Page E1094]]

are federal civilian employees or District of Columbia employees and 
took encampment leave. The DOD claims these employees were not entitled 
to encampment leave without a loss of pay. While I disagree with the 
DOD&#x27;s interpretation, I am introducing this bill to resolve this 
matter.
  Congress partially addressed this matter in the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (NDAA) by adopting my amendment 
that effectively prohibited the DOD from recouping pay for encampment 
leave taken by DCNG members after the enactment of the NDAA. That 
amendment, however, did not apply to encampment leave taken before the 
enactment of the NDAA because of budget rules.
  In 1899, Congress codified in the D.C. Code the original authority 
for entitlement to leave when federal civilian employees were mobilized 
by the DCNG. In 1968, that authority was moved into 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6323. 
In that same year, Congress authorized two additional leave 
entitlements in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6323, as well as established a salary 
offset provision in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5519 referencing those two additional 
leave entitlements. However, because the U.S. Code had not been updated 
to include the earlier DCNG authority, the U.S. Code contained a 
duplicate subsection, one referring to DCNG mobilizations and one to a 
general leave entitlement for the National Guard and Reserves.
  Based on this legislative drafting error, the DOD has sometimes 
attempted to apply a salary offset to DCNG members who are federal 
employees and took encampment leave, and the DOD has indicated it will 
do so again soon. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), has said 
that 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6323(c) was not intended to be subject to a salary 
offset under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5519 and noted in 1990 that the ``[Office of 
Personnel Management] advised that it now believes that the salary 
offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5519 do not apply to D.C. National 
Guardsmen under the circumstances described in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 6323(c).&#x27;&#x27; 
However, the Office of Personnel Management once again believes that 
the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5519 apply to 5 U.S.C. 
Sec. 6323(c).
  DCNG members sincerely believed that they were taking this leave 
correctly, they have relied on this money, the recoupment will cause 
financial hardships for current and former DCNG members and it was 
Congress&#x27; intent that DCNG members were entitled to this leave without 
a salary offset.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to recognize 
this year&#x27;s Catherine McAuley Distinguished Alumnae Honoree at Mount 
Mercy Academy, Meghan Crotty Quinn. For over a century, Mount Mercy 
Academy has been a beacon of light and an indispensable institution 
within our community. With a unique focus on academic excellence, 
women&#x27;s leadership, and a commitment to building a just society, it is 
only proper to commend the alumni who have contributed to this much-
deserved reputation.
  A proud South Buffalo resident, Meghan and her husband Kevin Quinn 
are the proud parents of Kiera (Mount Mercy Academy, Class of 2027), 
son Rory and daughter Colleen. Meghan is the daughter of Anita Durkin 
Crotty (Mount Mercy Academy Class of 1963) and Patrick Crotty. Meghan 
is a business and community leader. She graduated from John Carroll 
University in 2007 and earned the title of Certified Public Accountant 
shortly thereafter. Meghan&#x27;s rise in the banking industry has been 
rapid; after a stint with M&amp;T Bank, she now serves as a Senior Vice 
President in the Commercial Banking division at HSBC Bank. She has 
twice been recognized by her peers as a top 100 performer in United 
States commercial banking and is a recipient of the Irish Echo&#x27;s 40 
Under 40 Award in 2021. Meanwhile, her professional success has been 
coupled with a steadfast commitment of paying it forward. Meghan is the 
Treasurer of South Buffalo Roots, a rising community organization 
responsible for organizing the very successful South Buffalo Porchfest, 
Music in the Park series and South Buffalo Irish Festival. This 
dedicated group of volunteers in turn supports an array of neighborhood 
organizations using a creative model of giving back to other charitable 
organizations including, the South Buffalo Community Table, Buffalo 
Irish Center, Buffalo Refuse, local sports and school organizations, 
11-Day Powerplay, Kids Escaping Drugs, and Feed the Front Line. 
Citizens like Meghan--those who are consumed with doing right by their 
neighbors--are what makes Buffalo so special. Her commitment to 
professional excellence and bettering the Western New York community 
make for an incredible endorsement of Mount Mercy Academy and its 
principles.
  The award recipients and honorees tonight for Mount Mercy Academy&#x27;s 
22nd Annual Dinner have exceeded the already rigorous standard for the 
members within this community. Mount Mercy&#x27;s values and commitment to 
service are steeped in decades of tradition, and Meghan Crotty Quinn 
continues to live these values in her career and relationships.

                          ____________________
