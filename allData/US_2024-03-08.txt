 CELEBRATING THE PRESERVATION AND PERPETUATION OF THE HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JILL N. TOKUDA

                               of hawaii

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 8, 2024

  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, Hawaii&#x27;s constitution recognizes two 
official languages: English and Hawaiian. Each February, we celebrate 
Mahina `Olelo Hawai`i, or Hawaiian Language Month. It&#x27;s time for us to 
honor and promote the use of Hawaiian language, and to achieve this, we 
must create opportunities and environments where it can be celebrated 
and utilized. `Olelo Hawai`i is more than a language, it is a 
connection to a history and a culture that must never be forgotten. 
That is why it was so important to me to speak it today on the House 
floor. Long live the Hawaiian language.
  Therefore Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the translation in the 
Hawaiian language:
  Aloha e ka luna h`omalu,
  Ke hoia`i`o nei ko Hawai`i kumukanawai i na `olelo kuhelu `elua: ka 
Olelo Pelekania me ka Olelo Hawai`i. I kela me keia Pepeluali, e 
ho`omaika`i makou i ka Mahina `Olelo Hawai`i. `Okeia ka manawa kupono a 
kakou e ho`ohanohano a e paipai aku i ka `Olelo Hawai`i. I mea e ho`oko 
ai i ia hana, he ko`iko`i no ho`i ka `olelo a ho`olaule`a mau `ia o ka 
`Olelo Hawai`i ma na wahi like `ole, ma na `ano po`aiapili like `ole, a 
ma na `ano hanana like `ole`O ka `olelo Hawai`i, `a`ole ia he `olelo

                     EULOGY FOR RAYMOND NOEL RAMSEY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN B. LARSON

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 8, 2024

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to include in 
the Record the eulogy of a great American, Raymond Noel Ramsey, who 
epitomized what a citizen who gives back to his community, state, and 
Nation is all about.
       On behalf of Peg, Noele, Kelly, Melanie. and the entire 
     Ramsey family, thank you for being here for Ray. How about 
     that obituary and the prayer card! Ever the fashion 
     statement, wasn&#x27;t he, with those bright pastels and those 
     shirts, that were a reflection of his personality. Yesterday 
     was quite an afternoon and quite a tribute. It was good to 
     see old East Hartford on display--the outpour of love and 
     respect for a man who lived it.
       Now we know he had a great reception committee up there 
     with Billy Mud, Fred Kurtz, Fred Leone, and Jimmy Deleo 
     singing--I&#x27;m sure--as he entered the gates of Heaven. As Ray 
     would often remind the faint of heart, life is not a dress 
     rehearsal. He embodied both the right attitude and the 
     appetite for a life well lived.
       Talking with several of you at the wake, and over the past 
     few days, about stories of Ray and what he would want this 
     service to be--Father, I have to start with a disclaimer 
     here--Craig Jordan, Kevin Brown, and numerous others want to 
     be clear that the funniest Rammer stories are not suitable 
     for church or in mixed company. I think it&#x27;s safe to say he 
     was a guy&#x27;s guy.
       It was abundantly clear from all, that he would want an 
     upbeat sendoff on his next journey. First and foremost, and 
     most of all, the shared empathy, respect, and love for Peg 
     and his three angels, Noele, Kelly and Melanie. At the wake 
     it was hard viewing and watching them hold back the tears, 
     the grieving and the mourning and with each person. A memory 
     of a man whose actions were bigger than life, knowing even in 
     this difficult moment, what Ray would want is to celebrate 
     his journey and the relationships he shared with all of you. 
     I know I&#x27;m stating the obvious, as so many of you have spoken 
     of his lifelong love and relationship with Peg. Many of you 
     have attested that they were the quintessential couple. They 
     simply go together well, Ray and Peg. Peg and Ray. No 
     gathering was complete without them--and you talk about 
     opposites! Yet there was a greater bond that held them 
     together, certainly Noele, Kelly, and Melanie, but it was 
     their great faith and devotion to each other that always 
     resonated.
       Many of you said Ray was always there for you, no matter 
     how trivial or important. How many of you can recall being 
     with Ray into the wee hours of the morning, partaking in the 
     elixirs of life and thinking--as I have--there&#x27;s no way after 
     this that he gets up and takes Peg to mass in the morning--
     only to be astonished again by him being there for her and 
     their faith, dependable and rock solid. That&#x27;s love and 
     devotion. That&#x27;s Ray and Peg.
       Comradery is a great term about a gathering of friends, and 
     as Nick Olivia pointed out, with Ray, those gatherings were 
     always punctuated by having fun and enjoying one another&#x27;s 
     company, whether at the Hose Club, the Dirty Dozen, the F&amp;L 
     Dinners, or innumerable political events, Ray and a good time 
     were synonymous. He was always a doer, never a complainer and 
     put everyone else first. His last trip to Ireland is an epic 
     example. A trip he had planned for some time with Nick and 
     Vita, Bruce and Wendy, and he and Peg. As Bruce recalls, 
     weeks before, he had terrible and severe back pain and was 
     not feeling well, but would not let his health stand in the 
     way of a great trip with friends. While I&#x27;m sure the Guiness 
     helped, everyone knew he was in pain, but he did it because 
     of who he was and the people he cared about. That&#x27;s Ray.
       As my brother Danny says, having worked with Ray on 
     building the house--and you heard Father say how he did it 
     with his own hands--Ray had many skills, among his 
     specialties was electrical, with a minor in procurement. If 
     we needed hardware: nuts, bolts, nails, screws, blades, zip 
     ties, gloves, paint, or whatever, Ray always managed to come 
     up with a donor and keep us going. My brother went on to 
     describe his essence, saying what I believe everyone in this 
     room agrees with. He was the most dependable friend you could 
     have. First one on the site, and there till the end, and the 
     job was done. He had a broad base knowledge and a hands-on 
     versatility of all of the trades. Nothing that he couldn&#x27;t 
     figure out with an occasional break for a Marlboro or two. 
     His heart was bigger than himself, it&#x27;s as if he was made to 
     help everyone else. He was practical and direct and always 
     with an informed view.
       Now, most here assembled know Ray was the master of the 
     power nap. From which virtually in any environment he could 
     fall into a deep sleep, and awake and rally.

[[Page E230]]

     Danny Delmastro, of course, cites the best example of his 
     capability at the annual Aero Med Christmas Party, when about 
     three-quarters the way through a great evening, Rammer says 
     to Danny he&#x27;s going to ``step outside for a smoke.&#x27;&#x27; Danny 
     looks at him and says ``it&#x27;s snowing,&#x27;&#x27; Ray just nodded and 
     about an hour later with the place closing down and everyone 
     looking for Ray, Danny went outside and found him on a bench 
     with about three inches of snow on his head and his shoulders 
     and said, ``Rammer!&#x27;&#x27; And Ray responded without missing a 
     beat that ``yes, I&#x27;ll have a final final.&#x27;&#x27; That was our guy.
       He clearly is a giant of a man, Jim Iacobellis noted that. 
     He said he had a giant talent. He could do anything he put 
     his mind to. He had giant knowledge. He knew so much about so 
     much, and if he didn&#x27;t, he&#x27;d ask and inquire until he did. He 
     had a giant personality--the life and center of any 
     gathering, you always wanted to be around him and talk to 
     him. He was a giant friend. He had so many, and he knew them, 
     he knew what they liked, and knew what made them happy or 
     unhappy. He was also the first to accept new people and 
     become friends, as he did so with Jim more than 30 years ago 
     when he was the new kid on the block.
       Now, we have a Bocce tournament and a gathering and have 
     done so for 32 years, and whether it&#x27;s tents, limoncello, 
     garbanzo and hot peppers, you know, and of course, grilling 
     that sausage, it was Ray. And as Linda and Leslie attest and 
     verify and everyone agrees--without Ray, there would never 
     have been a Bocce. He was the essential part and mover.
       I think it&#x27;s safe to say that the way he lived his life and 
     in talking with David McQuaid, I said, ``David, he had a 
     great run.&#x27;&#x27; And David looked at me and says ``A run? He had 
     several runs.&#x27;&#x27; In short, Ray was authentic and original 
     without a phony bone in his body, dependable as the day was 
     long. He was always there for everyone and in so many 
     different capacities.
       In this human comedy we call life, his skills, his 
     curiosity, his inquisitive and honest and practical advice 
     will be what I miss the most. He was the real deal. He was 
     the Rammer.

                EXPANDING ACCESS TO CAPITAL ACT OF 2023

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of Minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2799, the 
Expanding Access to Capital Act. Mr. Chair, this bill does not in fact 
expand access to capital. It expands access to fraud.
  Historically, U.S. capital markets have been successful because of 
the transparency, accountability, and oversight required by 
regulations. Investors both here and abroad have confidence in the 
investments they make because they know companies are required to be 
transparent and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is 
obligated to perform oversight. However, large companies are now using 
exemptions designed for small businesses. This has resulted in an 
expansion of the private securities market, which is riskier than the 
public securities market because there are fewer and, in some cases, no 
disclosures required. H.R. 2799 would exacerbate these problems by 
allowing large companies to evade disclosure requirements and SEC 
oversight. The bill also reduces incentives for companies to go public 
through an initial public offering (IPO) which will deprive investors, 
including working families and retirees, of transparent investment 
opportunities.
  Everyday Americans invest their hard-earned money to save for their 
education, travel, buying a home, and retirement. H.R. 2799 threatens 
the existing regulations that protect everyday Americans from risky 
investments that would put their livelihoods in jeopardy. Under current 
regulation, financial professionals or companies are required to only 
sell private securities to investors who have access to reliable 
information, have a demonstrated ability to understand the risks, and 
have the financial wherewithal to absorb potentially severe investment 
losses. H.R. 2799 removes these safeguards, allowing financial 
middlemen to peddle risky private securities to unsuspecting, hard-
working Americans. H.R. 2799 sets everyday American investors up to 
fail.
  H.R. 2799 also includes anti-worker provisions that will harm gig-
workers like rideshare drivers, food delivery providers, and on-demand 
caregivers. The State of Minnesota has been working hard to prevent the 
misclassification of gig-workers workers as independent contractors and 
provide stronger protections for these workers. H.R. 2799 would preempt 
these efforts in Minnesota and around the country by prohibiting the 
classification of gig-workers as employees. This provision would cut 
off gig-workers&#x27; access to essential state-based rights and benefits 
like a minimum wage, unemployment insurance, overtime pay, health 
benefits, and workers compensation.
  Mr. Chair, H.R. 2799 eliminates crucial investor protections which 
would expose the investments of American families and seniors to 
financial fraud. I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 8, 2024

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor State Senator 
Betty Holzendorf, a Jacksonville native who dedicated her life to 
improving the lives of all Northeast Floridians.
  At the age of 84, Senator Holzendorf passed away on February 29, 
leaving behind legions of supporters and friends who were lucky enough 
to have known her bright spirit.
  A mainstay of Florida politics whose long career spanned across both 
chambers of the legislature, Senator Holzendorf was a true woman of the 
people who never stopped fighting for her constituents.
  One of Senator Holzendorf&#x27;s greatest passions was fundraising for 
universities and scholarships in Northeast Florida. As a science 
teacher, Betty knew that Florida is only as strong as its youth, so she 
championed education as an avenue to brighten the minds and futures of 
her constituents.
  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the long and 
fruitful life of Senator Holzendorf, along with offering our deepest 
condolences to her friends and family.

    HONORING THE 130TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF TEXAS COLLEGE

                                 ______

                         Friday, March 8, 2024

  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Texas College in Tyler, 
Texas commemorating its 130th anniversary.
  Founded in 1894, Texas College was formed by ministers of the 
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church to educate African-American 
students excluded from the university system of Texas at the time.
  Since its eventual charter in 1907, Texas College has aimed to form 
the next generation in theology, music, teaching and commercial 
training as well as agricultural and mechanical sciences.
  Today, Texas College inspires intellectual, spiritual, moral, and 
social development, empowering graduates to engage in life-long 
learning, leadership, and service. For generations, the college has 
formed upright, intelligent citizens who honor God through their 
knowledge, work, and families.
  I am proud to see the many accomplishments that Texas College has 
made since its inception. I am equally grateful to have Texas College 
as an integral part of the Tyler community and broader East Texas 
region.
  I look forward to another 130 years of success from the faculty and 
staff at Texas College as they celebrate their anniversary this month.

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 8, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Karen 
Hosler, a distinguished Baltimore Sun correspondent whose beats 
included Congress and the White House. Karen died on February 1 of this 
year, and it is an understatement to say that Karen lived life to its 
absolute fullest during her 75 years on this earth.
  Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to meet Karen, but I 
wish that I had. Those that worked with and knew her said, ``Karen 
always brightened up a room with her cheerfulness, her wonderful 
laughter, her joy for life and her deep commitment to first-rate 
journalism done the right way . . . She loved reporting on politics, be 
it Annapolis city government, the governor and General Assembly or the 
White House and Congress.
  Ms. Hosler earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism in 1970 from the 
University of Maryland, College Park, where she was on the staff of The 
Diamondback, the campus newspaper. After college, she got her start 
right here in Congress working as a press aide to U.S. Senator Charles 
Mathias and then began covering politics for The Bowie Blade and Prince 
George&#x27;s News. She then joined the staff in the early 1970s of what was 
then known as The Evening Capital in Annapolis, where she covered 
government, including the General Assembly and Anne Arundel County 
elections.
  Those that knew her in the newsroom describe her as ``. . . sassy, 
brassy and bold . . . She had the perfect reporter&#x27;s combination of 
skepticism of what the government officials she was covering was 
telling her and empathy for the people she covered . . . She asked the 
questions that got right to the heart of things.&#x27;&#x27;
  She then joined The Arundel Sun in 1977, and then went back to 
Annapolis, where she covered politics and state government. From 1980 
to 1983, she was the paper&#x27;s state political reporter and from 1983 to 
1988 its Maryland correspondent.
  In 1988, she was named White House correspondent where she covered 
the administrations of Presidents Ronald W. Reagan, George H.W. Bush 
and Bill Clinton.
  In 2002, my colleague, Representative Steny Hoyer, included in the 
Congressional Record that Ms. Hosler was ``always a tough interrogator 
of a politician. She asked the hard questions that we didn&#x27;t always 
like to answer, but she always got it out of us. She took her 
responsibility as a reporter very seriously and her readers were better 
off for it.&#x27;&#x27;
  As if her professional accomplishments were not enough, Karen 
completed 12 marathons including the Boston, New York and Marine Corps 
marathons and brought her love of running to Washington. In fact, she 
even ran with President Bill Clinton and described the President as ``a 
whole lot faster than he looks.&#x27;&#x27;
  In 1993, Karen became the congressional correspondent for The Sun 
until 1998, and its deputy Washington bureau chief from 1999 until 
2002.
  From 2008 until retiring in 2020, she was a WYPR talk show host, 
reporter and assignment editor.
  She was even the subject of a PBS special, which was based on a very 
personal piece written by Karen.
  In these times of political turmoil, it was inspiring to read Karen&#x27;s 
story and see what it means to live a life well lived. Fair winds and 
following seas to Karen, and may her memory be a blessing to her 
husband and United States Naval Academy adjunct professor, Alan 
Friedman, and her brother, Richard Argy.

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Demetrius West and 
The Jesus Promoters Gospel Choir on their 20th anniversary.
  Demetrius was influenced by his great-grandmother and discovered his 
passion for gospel music at an early age. As an internationally-
renowned recording artist, he has shared the stage with notable Gospel 
and Christian artists such as Marvin Sapp, Byron Cage, Kirk Franklin, 
and Chris Tomlin. His work made the Billboard Music Charts several 
times and has held several No. 1 hits on Gospel airplay radio charts. 
In 2015, Demetrius released the album ``Jesus Promoter&#x27;&#x27; in 2015 
featuring award-winning Earnest Pugh and 40-voice choir, The Jesus 
Promoters.
  An Indianapolis native, Demetrius has a deep-rooted sense of 
community, exemplified by his support to the Resource Hub Foundation, 
Westside Baptist Church, and other local organizations aiding families 
in need. He is additionally involved in local politics and elections, 
and as Minister of Music and Arts for the Westside Missionary Baptist 
Church with Pastor Michael O. Bryant. He has assisted many choirs, 
groups, soloists, and musicians with his knowledge and love of music by 
conducting workshops and seminars nationwide to help other ministries 
perfect their talents.
  Music helps us translate joy, sorrow, and faith. Demetrius West and 
The Jesus Promoters is a voice that resonates across generations and 
will continue to play a role in the cultural fabric of our community.
  Demetrius is married to the lovely Shalette West, and they have one 
beautiful daughter, Zanobia Denise.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Demetrius West and The 
Jesus Promoters Gospel Choir on their 20-year celebration.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 8, 2024

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life and 
legacy of a remarkable man, Mr. Robert ``Bob&#x27;&#x27; Wirth.
  Bob was born on October 2, 1932, and grew up in Shiocton before his 
family moved to their family farm in Hortonville. Beginning in high 
school, Bob was involved in many extra-curricular activities such as 
football and basketball. Bob demonstrated incredible leadership and 
talent resulting in him being named team captain for both football and 
basketball. Following high school, Bob was drafted into the Army and 
served at Fort Lewis in Tacoma. Washington. I commend Bob for his 
service and dedication to the United States.
  On March 2, 1957, Bob married the love of his life, Marlene Rollmann. 
Throughout their life together, they enjoyed years of happiness and 
welcomed five children: Barb, Kelli, John, Mark, and Ricky. Bob was so 
proud of each of these children and was thrilled as their family grew. 
Family was always of utmost importance to Bob, and he was blessed to 
have 15 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.
  When Bob wasn&#x27;t spending time with his growing family, he enjoyed 
many hobbies. Bob cherished each opportunity to join family and friends 
exploring the outdoors. He especially loved their annual deer hunts and 
snowmobiling trips. Bob&#x27;s kindness and friendship will be missed by 
many that were blessed to know him.
  Mr. Speaker, I honor the life and legacy of Mr. Robert Wirth and 
thank him for his years of service and dedication to the United States. 
My sincere thoughts and prayers go out to his wife of 67 years, 
Marlene, and his entire family during this difficult time.

                         Friday, March 8, 2024

  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to honor 
Indium Corporation as it celebrates its 90th Anniversary on March 13 of 
this year.
  Founded in 1934 by Dr. William S. Murray, Indium Corporation first 
operated from his garage at 805 Watson Place in Utica, New York. Dr. 
Murray was instrumental in identifying and enabling the first 
commercially viable applications for indium metal.
  Today, Indium Corporation is a premier materials refiner, smelter, 
manufacturer and supplier to the global electronics, semiconductor, 
thin-film, and thermal management markets. With five facilities in New 
York&#x27;s 22nd Congressional District and several located internationally, 
Indium Corporation is a global leader in materials science and 
electronics assembly solutions. Indium&#x27;s innovative products can be 
found in many common consumer electronics and high-reliability 
technologies such as electric vehicles, mobile devices, life-saving 
medical devices, and emerging 5G technology.
  Beyond Indium Corporation&#x27;s role as a manufacturer, the company 
bolsters local educational resources through STEM (science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics) outreach partnerships with schools, 
universities, and community organizations, impacting the lives of more 
than 5,000 students each year. Indium&#x27;s award-winning college 
internship program, inaugurated in 2012, has led to careers in STEM 
fields for over 100 students.
  In addition, Indium Corporation initiated a pioneering apprenticeship 
program, aiding employees who are seeking to learn new skills and 
pursue higher education and assisting military veterans with making 
successful transitions to private sector careers. The company recently 
celebrated its first graduates.
  Indium is committed to giving back to the community through the 
support of many charitable and quality-of-life organizations including 
the American Red Cross, Stuff the Bus, ICAN, United Way, Support Our 
Vets, and the American Heart Association. The company and its leaders 
have been honored by the Oneida County History Center, YWCA, MACNY, 
Mohawk Valley Alliance of Chambers of Commerce, and the Genesis Group.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 22nd Congressional District, I would like to 
congratulate Indium Corporation on the occasion of its 90th 
Anniversary. I wish them continued success for many years to come.

the challenges posed by intense competition in her effort to win the 
Division I One-Meter Dive State Championship.
  In pursuing the State Championship, Isabella defeated her opponent in 
the finals of the one-meter dive classification. Her hard work and 
dedication in achieving this accomplishment is truly outstanding. She 
has accomplished an impressive season record, bringing pride to her 
school and community.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute 
to Isabella Pfeil of Avon Lake High School. On behalf of the people of
