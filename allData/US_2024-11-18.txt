I rise today to honor and 
celebrate Claire Seiffer, who is celebrating her 100th birthday on 
November 21st of this year. Mrs. Seiffer has spent her entire life in 
the State of New Jersey, where she was a longtime public-school PE 
teacher. Her service to the state and nation was complemented by that 
of her husband, a World War II veteran. Mrs. Seiffer met her husband at 
the school that they worked at together after he returned from his 
military service. Mrs. Seiffer has fond memories of iceboating on their 
hand-built boat with her husband on New Jerseys famous Lake Hopatcong. 
Going into her 100th birthday, she continues to maintain an active 
lifestyle, and her friends and family enjoy her vivacious spirit and 
sharp mind.
  lt is my distinct pleasure to celebrate Mrs. Seiffer today, as she

I rise to honor the impressive and impactful 
career of Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg as he retires.
  Throughout his life, Chief Aldenberg dedicated his efforts to serving 
others.
  In a military career spanning 30 years, he commanded from the company 
to the brigade level and deployed in support of key operations to

he retires from a career in law enforcement.
  I congratulate Chief Aldenberg on a job very well done.
I rise today to honor the incredible life 
and service of U.S. Army Veteran Corporal Kenneth M. Wilson.

I rise today with my colleague Congressman 
Mike Thompson to honor Omar Gallardo who passed away on October 23, 
2024. Omar was a lifelong community activist, organizer, and leader in 
outdoor education in Sonoma County.
  Born in 1975 in Michoacan, Mexico, Omars early years were spent in 
Sonoma County, California and Mexico. He attended Geyserville High 
School, where bilingual staff and educators encouraged his interest in 
his Chicano culture, including his participation in Ballet Folklorico.
  From a young age, Omar was an active community organizer. He offered 
translation services with the United Farmworkers Union and led a trip 
to Delando, California in 1993 for a widely attended memorial march 
honoring leader Cesar Chavez. In 1994, hp organized student marches 
protesting Californias Proposition 187, an initiative to prohibit 
undocumented immigrants from accessing important benefits. Omar also 
participated in high school programs offered by Santa Rosa Junior 
College and Sonoma State University designed to mentor Latino students. 
He later attended both institutions and earned a bachelors degree in 
history.
  Following college, Omar joined California Mini-Corps as a teacher and 
spent eight years working with immigrant students in outdoor education. 
He then spent four years working as a student counselor in Santa Cruz 
County before returning to Sonoma County to be a site coordinator for 
the Graton Day Labor Center. In 2012, he was recruited to LandPaths: a 
Sonoma-based environmental education and conservation organization.
  Omar became an integral pillar of the LandPaths leadership team, 
guiding the organizations approach to community outreach and 
engagement. He helped predominantly Spanish-speaking youth access 
Sonoma open spaces and inspired the next generation of environmental 
stewards through outdoor programs. Omars efforts were also critical in 
the development of Santa Rosas Bayer Farm, a six acre urban farm that 
is the product of collaboration between LandPaths and the city. He was 
known for his gentle heart, treating others with dignity, and credited 
for expanding LandPaths reach and impact. In 2015, Omar was aptly 
honored by the Sonoma County Economic Development Board with a Spirit 
of Sonoma Award.
  Omar was also a dedicated Aztec dancer and established his own group, 
Danza Azteca Xantotl de Santa Rosa, which performed at local events.
, Omar Gallardo was a tireless community advocate and 
champion of environmental stewardship whose life ended too soon. He is 
survived by his wife Norma Lazaro Hernandez; his two young sons Tandee, 
age 13, and Erandi, age eight; his mother Maria Luisa Gallardo; and his 
sisters Marilu Gallardo, Olga Gallardo, Blanca Gallardo, and Merlinda 
Gallardo. His enduring legacy in Sonoma County and with future 
generations cannot be understated. We respectfully ask

that you join with us and his many friends and family in expressing our 
deep appreciation for his decades of leadership and community service.
the Critical Mineral Consistency Act (H.R. 
8446) and the Harnessing Energy At Thermal Sources (HEATS) Act (H.R. 
7409) would both limit the ability of the American public to have a say 
in protecting our public lands and determining how our natural 
resources are used.
  H.R. 8446 gives cover for the copper industry to gain access to tax 
credits and expedited permitting processes. Only critical minerals on 
the U.S. Geological Service (USGS) list can access these federal 
supports, and we should not be playing politics with that process.
  Foreign-owned mining conglomerates stand to benefit the most from 
this legislation, as they seek to fasttrack copper mines like those 
that threaten the watershed of the Boundary Waters Wilderness in 
Minnesota, or the sacred site of Oak Flats in Arizona. These companies 
will have no obligation to contribute to our domestic supply with the 
minerals they pull out of our public lands. But our surrounding 
communities will bear the costs of pollution that all copper mines 
create. The least we can do is ensure the public and our federal 
government has the full opportunity to review these mines.
  The American public should also not be subsidizing new copper mines 
when we have secure supply chains that meet our needs, as determined by 
the USGS. The USGS list of critical minerals intentionally differs in 
important ways from the Department of Energys list of critical 
materials. Minerals only make it on to the USGS list if their supply 
chain is at risk of disruption. The tax credits that Congress passed to 
encourage the development of at-risk critical minerals should not go to 
support the copper industry, when the U.S. is already a global top-five 
producer and a top-ten exporter of copper.
  The other bill under consideration today, the HEATS Act, would 
completely exempt certain geothermal projects that impact subsurface 
federal resources from the environmental review process if less than 
half of a geothermal project is non-federal. That means that if a 
project starts on private land but drills underground into publicly 
owned areas, it would not have to abide by the federal regulations.
  I want to be clear that geothermal is an important renewable energy 
source, and that advancing geothermal energy is a worthy goal. That is 
why the House has already passed bipartisan legislation, and the Biden 
Administration has streamlined the process for certain categories of 
geothermal projects. I secured community project funding for a 
Geothermal Heat Pump to replace the inefficient natural gas-based 
system at St. Pauls Como Park Zoo and Conservatory. However, we must 
ensure that when geothermal projects impact our federal resources, they 
go through our federal review process. The Bureau of Land Management, 
who overseas our federal subsurface areas, is concerned that this bill 
would undermine their ability to ensure public safety, to uphold 
environmental laws, to consult with tribal nations, and to fulfill 
their core mission of managing our natural resources for multiple use.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing both these misguided 
bills and protecting public review of projects that impact our public 
resources.
I rise today in recognition of my fellow 
Louisianan, Barry Melancon, who is retiring after 30 years from his 
role as President and CEO of the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) and 
CEO of the Association of International Certified Professional 
Accountants.
    Barry Melancon has dedicated his 41-year career to the accounting 
profession, Mr. Melancon began his role in 1995 at the age of 37, which 
made him the youngest CEO in the organizations history and now the 
longest serving CEO of AICPA. Mr. Melancons professional career began 
in Louisiana where he practiced as a CPA, eventually leading the 
Society of Louisiana CPAs before beginning his leadership role at 
AICPA.
In addition to 
testifying before Congress, Accounting Today named Barry Melancon the 
Most Influential Person in Accounting for 17 consecutive years, as well 
as the National Association Executive of the Year. Mr. Melancon has 
served as a member of AICPAs delegation to the International 
Federation of Accountants, board member of the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerces Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, board member of 
the Center for Audit Quality, chair of XBRL-US, and board chairman of 
the Global Accounting Alliance. Barry Melancon also received an 
Honorary Doctorate of Commerce from his alma mater, Nicholls State 
University, and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the 
2023 International Accounting Forum and Awards.
    It is my honor to recognize Barry Melancon for his passion, 
longstanding dedication, and leadership in the accounting profession. I 
am proud that a fellow Louisianan has played such a nationally 
prominent role in advancing innovation in his industry and mentoring a 
new generation of leaders. I commend Barry Melancon for his many years 
of dedicated service and wish him the best in his retirement.
I rise today to recognize the 
extraordinary life and service of Frederick P. Kessler. It is with a 
heavy heart that I share the news of his passing on November 12, 2024. 
I extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and the many 
people in our community whose lives he touched.
  Freds remarkable career began in this very chamber, where, as a high 
school student, he acted as a Page in the United States House of 
Representatives. By the time he was 20 years old, Fred had been elected 
to the Wisconsin State Assembly. Throughout this time, he played a 
pivotal role in achieving compromise during Wisconsins redistricting 
battles of the 1960s. Fred used his position to advocate for equal 
education, election reform, civil liberties, and fair housing. In the 
midst of his public service, he earned both a bachelors degree from 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a law degree from the 
University of Wisconsin Law School.
  Following the end of the legislative session in 1972, Fred was 
appointed to a judgeship in Milwaukee County. After working on the 
Wisconsin Legislative Council Committee on Court Reorganization in 
1978, Fred was appointed as a circuit judge for Milwaukee County. He 
served with distinction for 10 years, upholding the law and 
administering justice to the people of Milwaukee.
  In 2004, Fred returned to the Wisconsin State Assembly for 14 more 
years. During this period, Fred once again championed critical reforms 
in Wisconsins criminal justice system, elections, and federal 
relations. Freds dedication to justice will be dearly missed. His 
unwavering commitment to public service fills me with honor in 
recognizing his incredible career and passion for creating a more equal 
and just nation.

  I have long admired Freds dedication to improving the world around 
him. His legacy is one of selfless service, a steadfast pursuit of 
justice, and a profound care for others. Freds life was defined by his 
compassion, his integrity, and his unwavering belief in the power of 
public service to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. 
Fred was always a voice for the voiceless, a champion of fairness, and 
an advocate for those who needed it most.
, for all these reasons, I am proud to pay tribute to 
Frederick P. Kessler today. He has changed the lives of so many people, 
including my own constituents. The people of the 4th Congressional 
District, the State of Wisconsin, and the United States join me in 
thanking him for his legacy of service and commitment to the public 
good.
