               CELEBRATING GENE GERRARD&#x27;S 102ND BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. CLAUDIA TENNEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I use today to recognize the amazing life of 
United States Coast Guard Veteran Eugene ``Gene&#x27;&#x27; Gerrard, who recently 
celebrated his 102nd birthday.
  Gene, like many from the ``Greatest Generation&#x27;&#x27; wanted to begin his 
military career before reaching enlistment age but had to wait and 
finally enlisted in the Coast Guard in 1942. Gene served in the Coast 
Guard until 1945, where he attained the rank of Quartermaster First 
Class. For his service, he earned an American Campaign Medal, an 
Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, a Good Conduct Medal, a World War II 
Victory Medal, and a Philippine Liberation Medal.
  Previous to his enlistment, Gene worked as a printer by day and 
attended trade school by night in Brooklyn, New York. After his 
military service, Gene started his own printing business in Elmont, New 
York. Gene owned Gerrard Printing from 1951 to 1965, and St. Gerrard 
Printing in Port Jefferson Station, New York, from 1965 to 2013.
  Gene was also a dedicated public servant, having been elected as town 
councilman for 22 years. Gene also contributed to the Mount Sinai Fire 
Department for 50 years as its chief, chaplain, and fire police 
captain. He founded the Mt. Sinai Fire Department Benevolent 
Association and the Brookhaven Volunteer Firefighters Museum.
  Currently, Gene resides in the Town of Canandaigua in Ontario County, 
New York with his daughter, Pam Rushack. At 102 years old, Gene still 
gives back to the community by attending events, giving invocations, 
and leading in the Pledge of Allegiance. Most notably, Gene has served 
as a Red Coat Ambassador to the Canandaigua VA, where he has done so 
the last seven years.
  Gene Gerrard is an exceptional community member whose devotion to his 
country and his community is truly inspiring. It brings me great joy to 
know Gene. I am thrilled to recognize him for his many accomplishments 
and wish him a very happy 102nd birthday.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the 95th anniversary of 
the Lions Club of Kenmore and their remarkable contributions to our 
community.
  Founded in May of 1929, the Lions Club was established to support the 
visually impaired in Tonawanda and Kenmore. They are committed to 
improving access to eye and vision health for everyone through various 
initiatives such as their Eyeglass Collection Project, which gathers 
and distributes used eyeglasses worldwide. Locally, the club offers 
free vision screenings for children, as well as hearing aids and 
related examinations for those in need. The Kenmore Lions Club further 
creates welcoming spaces for the visually impaired, hosting annual 
Christmas parties, Thanksgiving dinners, and picnics throughout the 
year.
  In addition to their work for the visually impaired, the Lions Club 
is committed to serving the broader community in every possible way. 
Through participating in programs such as Adopt a Highway to keep our 
roads litter free, organizing personal care donation drives for women 
veterans, and providing scholarships for local high school students, 
the Kenmore Lions Club has undoubtedly made a positive impact on many 
people&#x27;s lives.
  I thank the Lions Club of Kenmore for 95 years of dedication and 
service in making our community a better place.

                     HONORING DANA CAMPBELL SAYLOR

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. GREG STANTON

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and legacy 
of Dana Campbell Saylor, a dedicated Phoenix community advocate and 
personal friend.
  From her early years as a student at Arizona State University, Dana 
knew she wanted to dedicate her life to fighting for social justice--
especially on issues related to women&#x27;s equality. She quickly 
established herself in the greater Phoenix area as a fierce advocate 
for the vulnerable and underserved, sitting on countless boards, 
councils, and commissions to channel her passion for public service.
  Throughout the years, Dana served four Arizona Governors, two Phoenix 
Mayors, and several ASU administrators in varying capacities to help 
address community issues. She used her advisory positions to propose, 
pass, and implement legislation to enhance the lives of women, 
children, and veterans.
  Many in the Phoenix community know Dana best for her role as CEO of 
the Maricopa County YWCA. She was a firm believer and role model of 
their mission to empower women, stand against racism, and promote 
peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all. As CEO, she focused her 
efforts on transforming the organization into the impactful entity it 
is today. She established the YWCA as a 501c4 for advocacy, created the 
YWCA Metropolitan Women&#x27;s Forum, and acted as YWCA Board Chair for the 
Pacific Region for several years.
  Throughout her lifetime, Dana was recognized with several highly 
esteemed honors and awards such as the NAWBO Visionary Award, the West 
Valley Mover and Shaker award, the YWCA Dorthy Willey Award, and an 
induction into the Phoenix Union Alumni Hall of Fame.
  Dana continued to serve others until her passing on May 13, 2024. She 
will be dearly missed, but her legacy in Phoenix will endure through 
the countless lives she touched. Godspeed.

                         HONORING DR. YANG DAO

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Dr. Yang Dao for a lifetime of achievements spanning over five decades 
of public service and community contributions to the multi-Lao ethnic 
people of Laos and the Hmong American Diaspora community in the United 
States and beyond. Born on September 7, 1943, to Yang Mi Nou and Her 
Kei in the Xieng Khouang Province during the Royal Kingdom of Laos, Dr. 
Yang Dao was educated in the time of the French colonial administration 
of Indochina, received a high school diploma in June 1964, and 
graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (baccalaureate francaise) from the 
University of Paris in 1968. With funding support from the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Dr. 
Yang Dao went on to complete a doctoral program in 1972, becoming the 
first Hmong in history to receive a PhD in Social Science from The 
Sorbonne University in France.
  After completing his graduate studies, Dr. Yang Dao returned to the 
Royal Kingdom of Laos to serve the government in many important roles, 
including as the Director of Human Resources in the Ministry of 
Planning from 1972 to 1974, and was later appointed by the King of 
Laos, His Majesty King Sisavang Vatthana as a member of the National 
Political Consultative Council (National Assembly) from 1974 to 1975 
during the last unity coalition government consisting of the Royalist 
and Neo Lao Hat Sak (Pathet Lao) political factions.
  The fall of Laos to the communist Pathet Lao in May 1975 forced 
hundreds of thousands of Lao, Hmong, and other multi-ethnic

[[Page E600]]

refugees to flee to the neighboring country Thailand by crossing the 
mighty Mekong River, where Dr. Yang Dao and his family joined the 
exodus of refugees in seeking safety. In July 1976, Dr. Yang Dao&#x27;s 
family resettled to France and later migrated to the State of Minnesota 
(USA) in 1983.
  Upon his arrival in the United States, Dr. Yang Dao joined the 
faculty at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities Campus as an Adjunct 
Professor teaching Southeast Asian Anthropology and History. He went on 
to teach at many local Twin Cities higher education institutions 
including Hamline University, and Metropolitan State University. 
Throughout his career, Dr. Yang Dao has authored many books, including 
Hmong History, Culture, and Spirituality at a Glance Through Speeches 
released in 2023, Hmong at the Turning Point (1993-French and English), 
and first Hmong-French Dictionary (1964). He has also co-authored many 
books and has written extensively in academic periodicals and Journals.
  Dr. Yang Dao is also a well-known public speaker who has participated 
in many national and international conferences in the United States, 
France, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and China. He speaks Hmong, Lao, 
French, English, Thai, Vietnamese and Cantonese (Chinese). Dr. Yang Dao 
is also a prolific artist and composer who has created albums and 
popular songs from Sib Pab Ciaj Vaj (Hmong unity) to Nkauj Hnub Twj 
Tuaj Ci lab (Hmong face a bright new dawn)
  As one of the very few surviving officials of the Royal Lao 
government, Dr. Yang Dao is still very active in civic engagement, 
frequently traveling internationally to foster public diplomacy by 
promoting peace and encouraging educational and cultural exchanges.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in this well-deserved tribute to Dr. Yang 
Dao, for his lifetime of service to Hmong Americans in Minnesota and 
across the United States of America.

            HONORING MRS. LEIGH WALKER FOR A LIFE OF SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARK E. GREEN

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
dedicated citizen from the greatest generation of Americans, Mrs. Leigh 
Walker.
  Mrs. Walker represents the best of patriotism and what it means to be 
an American. Eighty-three years ago, a fifteen-year-old in California 
heard a call to help her country. Pearl Harbor had been attacked, the 
United States entered the war, and women had just begun joining the war 
effort. Miss Leigh and her mother were two of the many civilians who 
reported for duty. Women across the country worked long hours and long 
weeks, including Leigh and her mother. After months of training, Miss 
Leigh became a certified welder and began working on ships in Richmond, 
California at only sixteen years old.
  The SS Red Oak Victory, a ship named for the small town in Iowa, was 
among the ships Mrs. Walker remembers working on. Built to last, this 
naval ship is still docked in Richmond today. Now no longer used for 
war, it is a testament to the skill and perseverance exemplified by 
young women during the war. Miss Leigh and many of her peers rose to 
the occasion and served their country well with strength and 
dedication.
  After the war, Leigh married Leland Walker, who was a highly skilled 
steamfitter and boilermaker. Together they moved across the country to 
Tennessee, which is still their home over 70 years later. Together, 
they raised two children: Jerry Walker, who served in the U.S. Army 
during the Vietnam War, and Marcia Chandler, an elementary school 
teacher of 46 years. Mrs. Walker and the late Mr. Walker have four 
grandchildren.
  Leigh Walker served her community in many informal ways as well. Mrs. 
Walker spent nearly twenty years helping her daughter&#x27;s students with 
reading and writing. She was a reliable volunteer at the high school 
baseball games where her son-in-law coached and spent many years making 
cakes treasured by her community for various events.
  Today, she is 97 years old and still resides in Dickson County, 
Tennessee. The advice she leaves speaks to her legacy; ``Be honest, 
love your family, and always vote.&#x27;&#x27;
  Leigh Walker&#x27;s life is a testament to the American spirit of duty and 
service, and it is with the greatest respect that I recognize her 
today.

    HONORING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE AND LEGACY OF MRS. MYRNA JACKSON

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. TERRI A. SEWELL

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the extraordinary life and 
legacy of Mrs. Myrna Carter Jackson, a civil rights activist and 
community leader in Birmingham, Alabama, who passed away on May 31, 
2024, at the age of 82.
  Mrs. Jackson was born on July 9, 1941, in Birmingham, Alabama as one 
of eight children to the late Willie George Carter and Willie Lee 
Ledger. After graduating from A.H. Parker High School at the age of 
sixteen, she attended Barbara Durr Beauty College in 1965 and obtained 
a license in cosmetology. Later in life, she continued her educational 
journey at Lawson State Community College and Miles College, graduating 
with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in social work in 2000.
  Mrs. Jackson became involved in the Civil Rights Movement at an early 
age, serving as the First Vice President of the Metro Birmingham Branch 
of NAACP. After the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, she 
participated in the Children&#x27;s March and Monday Masses, organized by 
the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and Reverend Fred 
Shuttlesworth. In response to her peaceful demonstration, Mrs. Jackson 
was jailed twice and spent more than three weeks in the Birmingham 
Jail. She experienced violence and troubling conditions during her 
incarceration but drew strength from the support and comradery that she 
received from other members of the Movement.
  A dedicated community leader, Mrs. Jackson&#x27;s commitment to service 
was the throughline of her career. She served as a certified substitute 
teacher for several Birmingham schools, provided social services and 
workforce development to survivors of Hurricane Katrina, facilitated 
job training for students through the Birmingham Works for Youth, and 
served as Commissioner of the Housing Authority of the Birmingham 
District. As a member of the Top Ladies of Distinction, she worked with 
Top Teens of America to provide scholarships and funding for students.
  Even later in life, Mrs. Jackson&#x27;s commitment to the ideals of the 
Civil Rights Movement never wavered. In 2009, she organized a 
conference with the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and the FBI to 
promote healthy dialogue between youth and law enforcement. In 2017, 
she helped commemorate the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument 
and went on to serve as the Interim President for the Metro Birmingham 
Branch of the NAACP.
  Mrs. Jackson received much recognition for her remarkable leadership 
and contributions to the Civil Rights Movement. She was honored by the 
Metro Birmingham Branch of the NAACP in 2013 for the 50th anniversary 
of the Civil Rights Movement. In 2017, she was selected by The 
HistoryMakers for an oral history interview of her incredible life 
story.
  Mrs. Jackson is preceded in death by her husband, Issic Jackson; 
parents Willie George Carter and Willie Lee Ledger; and three brothers, 
Gilbert Carter, Alfred Lee Carter, and John Carter. She is survived by 
two sons Jeffery Jackson and Michael Jackson; one granddaughter Denitra 
Streeter; one grandson Kieron Jackson; one brother Willie Carter Jr.; 
four sisters Sylvia Weatherspoon, Lee Edna Boone, Iris Elom, and Wanda 
Morton, and a host of cousins, friends, and church members.
  On a personal note, Mrs. Jackson was a source of great inspiration 
for me and so many young Black women. A trailblazer and pioneer, she 
was devoted to her community, her family, and the power of the Civil 
Rights and Voting Rights Movement. It is because of the courage, 
bravery, and strength of Foot Soldiers like Myrna Carter Jackson that 
we enjoy the freedoms we have today. Her life is a testament to the 
power of ordinary Americans to achieve extraordinary social change. May 
we find comfort in knowing that she lived a full and blessed life, and 
that her legacy will live on in the lives she touched.
  On behalf of Alabama&#x27;s 7th Congressional District, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy 
of Mrs. Myrna Carter Jackson and her many contributions to the City of 
Birmingham, the State of Alabama, and our Nation. May she Rest in Peace 
and Power.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I celebrate the 150th anniversary of 
the Lansing Woman&#x27;s Club, an organization of incredible women dedicated 
to personal growth, knowledge, and the betterment of their community. 
Founded in 1874, the Club has played an instrumental role in promoting 
lifelong learning and cultural enrichment, thus lifting the skylines of 
its members, the city of Lansing, and beyond.
  The Lansing Woman&#x27;s Club began with 25 pioneering women who shared a 
deep commitment to intellectual improvement. Their dedication is 
encapsulated in the Club&#x27;s founding purpose: the study and improvement 
of its members in literature, science, and the fine arts. More than a 
century later, the Club proudly carries on its mission as members meet 
each week to learn from one another through the sharing of individually 
written research papers.
  Throughout its history, the Club has been a beacon of progress and 
inclusivity, committed to welcoming open-minded and determined women to 
mirror the diverse community it serves. Members have come from various 
walks of life and professional backgrounds, including doctors, 
academics, civil servants, and members of the clergy, and have 
established and supported cultural organizations, hospitals, and 
educational institutions. To this day, members not only contribute 
their time and volunteer efforts, but also foster community engagement, 
provide aid to refugees and supply food and clothing to those in need.
  Over the years, the Lansing Woman&#x27;s Club has hosted many 
distinguished guests to share their passion and expertise with members, 
including Frank Lloyd Wright Creativity Award-winning architect Alden 
B. Bow, three-time Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Sandburg, and acclaimed 
author Madeleine L&#x27;Engle.
  Even in the face of adversity, including a devastating fire in 1996 
that severely damaged the group&#x27;s clubhouse, the resilience of its 
members has ensured the Club&#x27;s enduring presence. Inspired by one of 
the Club&#x27;s earliest members, Irma T. Jones, these women continue to 
demonstrate that our futures are limited only by the boundaries we set 
for ourselves.
  As we commemorate this significant milestone, let us recognize the 
Lansing Woman&#x27;s Club for its unwavering commitment to education, 
culture, and service to the community. It is with profound respect and 
gratitude that I honor the Club&#x27;s 150th anniversary and recognize its 
members&#x27; contributions. May the Lansing Woman&#x27;s Club continue to 
inspire and lead for many more generations to come.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Mr. John Brewer. A passionate journalist and dedicated community 
leader, John passed away in mid-April.
  I got to know John when I first ran for Congress back in 2012. From 
the first moments I spent with him, I learned just how deeply he cared 
about his community, and his passion for local journalism.
  John was the consummate newsman and dedicated his professional career 
to the field of journalism. His first job was with the weekly Upland 
News in his hometown of Upland, California in 1965. From there, he went 
on to work with The Associated Press for 19 years as a reporter, 
editor, bureau chief, and executive in Seattle, Los Angeles, and New 
York.
  As the Seattle bureau chief, he oversaw the coverage of the 
devastating 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. In Los Angeles, he 
oversaw the coverage of the 1984 Summer Olympics. During his 10 years 
as president, CEO, and editor-in-chief of The New York Times 
Syndication Sales Corp., he enlisted high-profile columnists, including 
Mikhail Gorbachev, Martha Stewart, and former President Jimmy Carter.
  After a prolific career around the country, John joined the Peninsula 
Daily News in 1998, where he championed local journalism until his 
retirement in 2015.
  John was heavily involved in his community in the North Olympic 
Peninsula, supporting over 25 nonprofits and other organizations, 
including the Port Angeles Downtown Association, Community 
Multicultural Alliance, and Peninsula Home Fund. He served on several

[[Page E603]]

community boards and was a past president of Allied Daily Newspapers of 
Washington, a statewide press association.
  Mr. Speaker, I join our communities of Clallam and Jefferson counties 
in grieving the loss of a pillar of the community, passionate and 
dedicated journalist, and compassionate father, brother, husband, and 
friend. I join John&#x27;s wife, Barbara, his two sons, and the rest of his 
family in grieving this sudden and tragic loss.
  Mr. Speaker, I recognize that journalism, not just at the local 
level, but across the country, is better because of the dedicated work 
and passion of Mr. John Brewer. His impact and legacy will be felt in 
Port Angeles and the broader Washington State community for many, many 
years to come.

          RECOGNIZING JUNE 9TH AS BATTEN DISEASE AWARENESS DAY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Batten 
Disease Awareness Day. Batten Disease is a fatal rare disease of the 
nervous system that usually begins in childhood. In the U.S., an 
estimated two to four children out of every 100,000 will get the 
disease, and unfortunately, there is no cure.
  On June 9th Batten Disease advocates around the world will celebrate 
International Batten Disease Awareness Day. Families and caregivers 
impacted by this disease are often fighting a silent battle due to a 
lack of public awareness. Increasing awareness helps honor their fight 
and strengthen the development of innovative treatment options and 
research for a cure. That&#x27;s why last year I was proud to introduce a 
resolution in support of Batten Disease Awareness Day.
  I urge my colleagues to join me on June 9th in honoring the families 
and caregivers, and most importantly, the children who have been 
impacted by this terrible disease.

           RECOGNIZING MONSIGNOR MICHAEL PICARD&#x27;S RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, June 7, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
individual from my district, Monsignor Michael Picard, who has touched 
and bettered countless lives in our community through his unwavering 
faith and commitment to his vocation as a Pastor.
  Born May 30, 1938, Michael Picard entered St. Charles Borromeo 
Seminary in Philadelphia in 1956 at just 18 years old. After nearly a 
decade of rigorous theological training, he was ordained on May 21, 
1966, and embarked on an illustrious 58-year career dedicated to 
serving the Lord and guiding the spiritual lives of countless 
individuals and community members.
  Affectionately known as Father Mike, he embarked on his pastoral 
journey as an Associate Pastor at Corpus Christi Church. Then, in 1967, 
he was assigned to Cardinal O&#x27;Hara High School, where he wore many 
hats: Teacher, Guidance Counselor, Counselor, Basketball Moderator, and 
Vice Principal for two years. Throughout his tenure there, Father Mike 
profoundly impacted students and colleagues alike. He mentored 
countless young men and women, guiding them toward successful futures 
and emphasizing the importance of character, integrity, and unwavering 
faith.
  Father Mike embarked on a new mission in 1981, taking on the role of 
Principal at Lansdale Catholic High School. Here, he continued to be a 
beacon of inspiration and guidance for his students and community, 
exemplifying unwavering dedication and faith. His remarkable talents 
and unparalleled leadership qualities caught the eye of the Archdiocese 
of Philadelphia, leading to his recruitment as the Director of the 
Cardinal&#x27;s Commission and Office for Human Relations.
  In 1989, Father Mike answered the call to serve once more and took on 
a new role at Saint Andrews Catholic Church in Newtown, Pennsylvania. 
It has been here at Saint Andrew&#x27;s that Father Mike has served as 
Pastor, mentor, and friend to over 20,000 parishioners for the past 35 
years. While his list of accomplishments is undoubtedly impressive, the 
quiet, personal moments are what define his profound impact. With every 
baptism, confirmation, First Communion, Matrimony, and anointing of the 
sick, Father Mike has been a steadfast presence for so many in life&#x27;s 
most significant moments. His unwavering support and genuine kindness 
have intricately woven together the fabric of the church community, 
forming a beautiful tapestry of love and faith. In moments of joy and 
sorrow, he has stood as a steady pillar of comfort, offering solace and 
hope to all in need. His influence has grown to extend far beyond the 
physical walls of Saint Andrews, touching the hearts and minds of 
everyone fortunate enough to encounter him.
  For Father Mike, being a Pastor is not merely a job but a lifelong 
vocation. His tireless efforts in shepherding the largest Catholic 
church in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and fostering a warm, 
welcoming environment have transformed Saint Andrews into a beacon of 
hope, inclusivity, joy, and peace for all who cross its threshold. Yet 
these accomplishments are not what defines him. Father Mike has shown 
us that true greatness lies in the everyday acts of kindness, 
compassion, and encouragement and has the power to transform a 
community.
  It is my great honor to commend and congratulate Monsignor Michael 
Picard--our beloved Father Mike--on 58 years of inspiring service to 
our community. His exemplary character, unwavering faith, and positive 
spirit have touched and bettered the lives of so many, and his legacy 
will continue to inspire generations of our community members.
  My sincere and best wishes to Father Mike as he enters this next 
chapter of life--may it be filled with continued blessings and the same 
spirit of love and devotion that has defined his life&#x27;s work. Thank you 
to Father Mike for his incredible contributions. His legacy will 
forever shine brightly in our hearts and our community.
