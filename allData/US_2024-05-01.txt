  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my 
warmest congratulations to Bernardsville on its 100th anniversary. I am 
truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with them 
all.
  Over the past 100 years, Bernardsville has blossomed into a vibrant 
town with exquisite natural scenery, rich culture, and a bustling town 
center. Bernardsville is also home to my congressional district office, 
so I can personally attest to its unique charm and history. I am proud 
to have such a remarkable town within the 7th district, and I look 
forward to watching it continue to flourish in the coming decades.
  I wish Bernardsville a wonderful centennial anniversary. May their 
next century be filled with as much success as this one.

                          ____________________

                    HONORING MARIA CONTRERAS TEBBUTT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 1, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Maria 
Contreras Tebbutt, whom I have named the 2024 Climate Crisis Champion 
for Yolo County because of the important work she has done to promote 
cycling as an alternative form of transponation to address the impacts 
of climate change on California&#x27;s 4th Congressional District.
  Maria Contreras Tebbutt was born in King City, California. She and 
her husband Mark have a daughter, Nicole. She is a graduate of Davis 
High School and has lived in Davis ever since graduation.
  Through her role as the Outreach Director of the Bike Campaign, Ms. 
Contreras Tebbutt has educated our community about the value of 
cycling. This campaign, along with its counterpart, the Bike Garage, 
was founded in 2011 to help teach people about the benefits of cycling 
and encourage people to ride their bikes more. These two locations 
offer training, internships, and jobs for youths, as well as enrichment 
opportunities for seniors who volunteer. The Bike Campaign works 
closely with city governments, county health departments, school 
districts, and community service groups.
  Her advocacy for cycling has also given Ms. Contreras Tebbutt the 
opportunity to advocate on behalf of seniors and people with 
disabilities. She recently partnered with Cycling Without Age--Trishaw 
Electric&#x27;s assist rides program, which provides opportunities for 
seniors and those with disabilities to enjoy cycling in Davis. This 
program allows those with mobility limitations to enjoy parks and green 
spaces more easily. Her work on this program has given her the 
opportunity to partner with the Davis Senior Center, the Yolo Healthy 
Aging Alliance, Yolo Hospice, various faith-based organizations, Rancho 
Yolo, and various senior residential facilities in the county. Ms. 
Contreras Tebbutt&#x27;s advocacy on behalf of cycling has meaningfully 
benefited some of the most vulnerable in our community, which is 
laudable.
  Ms. Contreras Tebbutt&#x27;s cycling work has also given her the 
opportunity to connect with our local leaders. She has built 
partnerships with the City of Davis&#x27;s Public Works Program, the City of 
Woodland&#x27;s Department of Transportation, the Woodland Chamber, the 
Woodland City Council, and the Davis City Council. She has also been an 
influential voice in the planning of various community cycling events, 
such as the Zombie Ride, Ice Cream Ride, and the Polar Bear Ride.
  Ms. Contreras Tebbutt&#x27;s life-long advocacy for cycling and its mental 
and physical, as well as environmental, benefits, make her an important 
community leader in combatting the climate crisis.
  Mr. Speaker, it is evident that Maria Contreras Tebbutt is a leader 
dedicated to promoting cycling as an alternative method of 
transportation. Therefore, it is fitting that we honor her here today 
as Yolo County&#x27;s 2024 Climate Crisis Champion.

                         Wednesday, May 1, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
Mississippi Center for Cultural Production. This organization has gone 
beyond the call of duty to ensure that rural communities in Mississippi 
are taken care of, and their stories are told.
  The Mississippi Center for Cultural Production, also known as ``Sipp 
Culture,&#x27;&#x27; is an approach and resource for cultivating thriving 
communities. Based in the rural South, Sipp Culture is honoring the 
history and building the future of Rural Hinds County, especially in 
the Town of Utica, MS.
  Sipp Culture supports community development from the ground up 
through cultural production focused on self-determination and agency 
designed by them and for them. The organization believes that history, 
culture, and food affirm our individual and collective humanity. Their 
goal is to strengthen the local food system, advance health equity, and 
support rural artistic voices--while activating the power of story--all 
to promote the legacy and vision of Utica, MS.
  At the core of it all is the unwavering belief that gathering and 
sharing local stories is the best way to support safe and thriving 
communities for the future. Honoring growth, story, and imagination is 
an approach that can cultivate healthy and equitable places everywhere. 
For Sipp Culture, it all starts in Utica. I firmly believe the work 
Sipp Culture has done for the communities in Hinds County can be a 
model for what should be done for rural communities all across the 
United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing The 
Mississippi Center for Cultural Production for their service to the 
citizens of Mississippi.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 1, 2024

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Thomas Leiser 
of Dallas, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award. 
Thomas has dedicated himself to serving and uplifting our community.
  In 1974, Thomas graduated from Indiana University and earned his 
Juris Doctor from Indiana University School of Law four years later. He 
began his career as a clerk and bailiff for Marion County Criminal 
Courts before being selected to serve as a Deputy Prosecutor. In 1982, 
Thomas stepped into the real estate industry and worked as an 
investment advisor for Leiser Real Estate Advisory in New York City. 
After a brief moment serving as an associate business law professor, he 
began working for the Trammell Crow Company in Dallas and rose up its 
ranks to become its Senior Managing Director. With plenty of experience 
in the commercial real estate market, Thomas co-founded Bandera 
Ventures in 2003. Since then, his agency has completed over a hundred 
real estate projects throughout the United States worth nearly $3 
billion dollars. Currently, Thomas is working on a billion-dollar 
project to construct a data center.
  Separately, Thomas has supported numerous humanitarian initiatives 
around the world. He worked closely with the Agape Manna nonprofit to 
develop a bakery to provide orphaned children in North Korea with food. 
Thomas also supported efforts to help North Koreans seek freedom from 
the Communist regime and begin a new chapter in life in South Korea. He 
is the co-founder of Crosswater Ministries, which supports Mission 
activities for the Highland Park Presbyterian Church to deliver food 
and medical supplies to Cuban families. I am proud of the outstanding 
work Thomas has accomplished for our community and those in need. I 
wish him continued success for many years to come.
  It is an honor to bestow Thomas with the Patriot Award for his 
exceptional service to the people of North Texas.

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 1, 2024

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special 
tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio&#x27;s Fifth Congressional 
District. I am pleased to announce that Nicholas Geraci of North 
Ridgeville, Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States 
Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
  Nicholas&#x27;s offer of appointment permits him to attend the United 
States Air Force Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2028. 
Attending one of our Nation&#x27;s military academies offers the opportunity 
to serve our country and receive a world-class education. At the same 
time, these young men and women undertake one of the most challenging 
and rewarding experiences of their lives.
  Nicholas brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and 
dedication to the incoming Class of 2028. While attending North 
Ridgeville High School, he participated in Key Club, coached middle 
school track and field, coached powder-puff football, and was on the 
honor roll. Throughout high school, Nicholas was involved in track and 
field, earning his varsity letter. After high school, he attended the 
University of Akron in Akron, Ohio, majoring in Aerospace Engineering.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
Nicholas Geraci on his offer of appointment to the United States Air 
Force Academy. Our service academies offer the finest military training 
and education available, and I am positive that Nicholas will excel 
during his career at the Air Force Academy. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to 
our Nation.
