                         APPRECIATING BULGARIA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I am grateful to 
recognize the 120th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the 
United States of America and the Republic of Bulgaria.
  September 19, 2023, marks the 120th anniversary of the establishment 
of diplomatic relations between the United States of America and the 
Republic of Bulgaria. The first United States Diplomatic Agent to 
Bulgaria, John B. Jackson, presented his credentials on September 19, 
1903. The first Special Envoy and Minister Plenipotentiary of Bulgaria 
to the United States, Stefan Panaretov, presented his credentials to 
President Woodrow Wilson on December 22, 1914. Today Bulgaria is well 
represented in Washington by Ambassador Georgi Aanayotor who also was 
an election observer for the South Carolina Presidential Primary in the 
tradition of former Ambassador Elena Poptodorova.
  The enduring ties between the two nations are exemplified by the 
founding of the American College of Sofia, dating back to a school 
opened by American missionaries in Bulgaria in 1860. On September 25, 
2023, the United States and Bulgaria held the second high-level 
Strategic Dialogue to advance their bilateral, regional, and global 
agenda and to further enhance cooperation as friends, Allies, and 
partners.
  The United States and Bulgaria stand together as North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) Allies, determined to safeguard the freedom, 
common heritage, and civilization of their peoples, founded on the 
principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law, 
seeking to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area. 
They have signed numerous important documents in key areas, including 
defense and security cooperation, 5G security, civil nuclear 
cooperation, science and technology, and combating foreign 
disinformation and propaganda.
  The United States and Bulgaria stand united against aggression and 
terror, condemning in the strongest possible terms Russia&#x27;s brutal and 
unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, and the heinous attacks 
on the Israeli people by the terrorist organization Hamas. Bulgaria 
remains committed to the collective defense, as exemplified by hosting 
a NATO battlegroup with United States participation, and by 
establishing a NATO littoral countries mine countermeasures task force 
to secure freedom of navigation in the Black Sea. Prior to becoming a 
NATO member and subsequently, as an ally, Bulgaria participated in the 
United States-led and NATO missions and operations in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, Libya, Kosovo, and the Mediterranean.
  Bulgaria was among the very first countries to denounce terrorism and 
pledge active support to the United States in the fight against 
terrorism following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Bulgaria 
provided overflight and basing rights at the town of Bourgas for 
Operation Enduring Freedom, representing the first stationing of 
foreign forces in Bulgaria since World War II, and Bulgaria deployed a 
nuclear, biological, and chemical protection detachment to Afghanistan 
as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The 
United States and Bulgaria recognize that Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion 
of Ukraine has only underscored the geostrategic importance of the 
Black Sea region, and the need to ensure that the region remains free 
and secure from threats posed by Russia and other malign actors.
  The bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) was signed in 2006, 
regulating the status of forces, allowing for joint United States-
Bulgarian military facilities, providing for bilateral and multilateral 
exercises, and facilitating the movement and temporary stationing of 
aircraft and vessels. Bulgaria continues to invest in defense 
capabilities, interoperability, and the development of a credible 
defense posture in cooperation with the United States, as exemplified 
by the purchase of sixteen F-16 Block 70 fighter jets from the United 
States, and intending to purchase United States Stryker combat 
vehicles.
  The United States and Bulgaria share the understanding that energy 
security is crucial component of national security, and Bulgaria has 
made significant progress in reducing its dependency on Russian energy 
resources and in diversifying its energy sector in collaboration with 
the United States. The two nations acknowledge the significance of 
intensifying their cooperation in innovations, research, and emerging 
technologies. The people-to-people exchanges between the United States 
and Bulgaria are vital for bolstering the bilateral relationship and 
Bulgaria has made progress towards meeting criteria for visa-free 
travel of Bulgarian citizens to the United States. The shared 
commitment to counter disinformation and hybrid threats was 
demonstrated by the signing of a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding 
on Countering Foreign Information Manipulation on September 25, 2023.
  The year 2023 marks the 80th anniversary of the historic rescue of 
50,000 Bulgarian Jews during the World War II. It is acknowledged with 
regret and sadness that 11,343 Jews were deported to Nazi concentration 
camps from Macedonia, Thrace, and Pirot, territories administered by 
Bulgaria at that time.

[[Page E583]]

Bulgaria takes pride in its Jewish community and remains resolute in 
its stance against any forms of discrimination, intolerance, and 
antisemitism.
  The vibrant Bulgarian-American community is contributing to America&#x27;s 
prosperity, including to its remarkable economic achievements, the 
preservation of its technological edge, and the enrichment of American 
culture and society, through its diverse talents, rich traditions, art, 
music, dance, cuisine, and language. Bulgaria&#x27;s presence in the world&#x27;s 
biggest library, the United States Library of Congress is marked with a 
collection of over 50,000 volumes of Bulgarian cultural heritage, 
brought together by the Library of Congress in collaboration with 
Bulgarian individuals and institutions since the 1880s. The American 
University in Bulgaria, the pioneer of American-style liberal arts 
education in Eastern Europe, has been delivering exceptional education 
for more than three decades. There are 41 Bulgarian Sunday schools in 
the United States, which are contributing to the preservation of 
Bulgarian language and traditions and to the cultural diversity in the 
United States. Bulgaria is the place of origin of the Cyrillic 
alphabet, which is currently taught in the Bulgarian Sunday schools 
across the United States.
  The Bulgarian Caucus in the House of Representatives was formed in 
June 2002 and the following year a group for friendship with the United 
States was formed in the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria 
demonstrating a dedication to the bilateral relationship. America&#x27;s 
most successful and enduring relationships are built on shared values.

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my 
warmest congratulations to Somerset County 4-H on the 50th anniversary 
of the Ted Blum 4-H Center. I am truly grateful to be celebrating this 
monumental milestone with you all.
  Named after Ted Blum, one of the most important and beloved figures 
in New Jersey&#x27;s 4-H community, Somerset County&#x27;s 4-H Center was touted 
as the largest building of its kind in the nation when it opened in 
1974. The Ted Blum 4-H Center has served as a model for 4-H facilities 
nationwide, providing meeting spaces for clubs and events as well as 
office space for the dedicated staff and volunteers who continue to 
ensure that ``4-H Is Tops&#x27;&#x27;.
  I wish all the best to Somerset County 4-H on the 50th anniversary of 
the landmark Ted Blum 4-H Center, and I extend my thanks for all that 
they do for our community.

  COMMEMORATING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, on June 4, we commemorate the 35th 
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, an event that serves as a 
stark reminder of the brutality of authoritarianism and its tragic 
human costs.
  Thirty-five years ago in 1989, in the heart of Beijing, the world 
witnessed a military crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy protesters in 
Tiananmen Square. The Chinese government&#x27;s violent suppression of 
student-led demonstrations shook the world&#x27;s conscience, leaving a 
permanent scar on the collective memory of humanity and reminding us of 
the lengths to which authoritarian regimes will go to maintain their 
grip on power. There are credible estimates that more than 200,000 
Chinese army soldiers killed nearly 1,000 people and wounded many 
thousands more. In the decades since the massacre, the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) has relentlessly pursued its agenda of control 
and repression, which has stifled dissent and trampled on the 
fundamental rights of its citizens. Freedom of speech, assembly, and 
religion remain severely curtailed, with censorship and surveillance 
pervasive throughout the country. Dissidents, human tights activists, 
and religious

[[Page E581]]

minorities continue to face persecution, imprisonment, and even 
disappearance simply for expressing their beliefs or advocating for 
change.
  The CCP continues its efforts to control the political discourse 
across the entire country and in every territory under its control. The 
crackdown in Hong Kong is one such example. The imposition of the 
draconian National Security Law in 2020 marked a turning point in the 
erosion of the city&#x27;s autonomy and freedoms. Pro-democracy activists, 
journalists, and political figures have been arrested, charged, and 
silenced under the guise of national security, while Beijing tightens 
its grip on the former British colony. The passage of the Article 23 
legislation, which further restricts basic freedoms of speech and 
assembly, will continue the erosion of the ``one country, two systems&#x27;&#x27; 
principle, undermining the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong and 
threatening the stability and prosperity of the entire region. For this 
reason, I, along with Congressman Gus Bilirakis, introduced a House 
Resolution that condemns the promulgation of the new Article 23 
legislation and calls on other members of the international community 
to similarly condemn the process of undermining freedoms in Hong Kong.
  While the total number of lives impacted by China&#x27;s suppression of 
basic freedoms may never be fully known, I am honored to serve as an 
advocate for one person who has witnessed firsthand the brutality of 
the regime. Mr. Ding Jiaxi, a prominent human rights lawyer and 
democracy advocate was wrongfully imprisoned in 2019 for his peaceful 
activism and charged for the crime of ``subversion of state power.&#x27;&#x27; 
Mr. Ding&#x27;s courageous efforts to defend the lights of marginalized 
communities and promote greater government accountability made him a 
target of the regime&#x27;s ruthless crackdown on dissent. His arbitrary 
detention, which included solitary confinement and physical abuse, 
serves as a stark reminder of the grave risks faced by those who dare 
to challenge the authoritarian rule of the CCP. Together with the 
Congressional Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission&#x27;s Defending Freedoms 
Project, I am committed to advocating for his release and reunion with 
his family.
  As we remember the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre and honor 
their memory, we must reaffirm our commitment to the values of 
democracy, human rights, and freedom. We stand in solidarity with the 
people of China, Hong Kong, and all those around the world who continue 
to courageously resist oppression and dream of a better future. Let us 
continue to pursue a world where freedoms are protected, and people 
like Mr. Ding Jiaxi, are not wrongfully imprisoned and silenced, but 
instead honored for their work to improve society. The image of a 
single protestor who stood in the way of a column of tanks rolling 
through the streets of Beijing in June 1989 will continue to inspire 
those who will bravely face brute force for the sake of freedom. In 
confronting tyranny and injustice, we draw inspiration from the courage 
and resilience of those who have dared to challenge authoritarian rule. 
Their struggle is our struggle, and their cause is our cause.

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bernice Trotter, a World 
War II veteran, and Tulsa native, who turned 100 years old yesterday.
  Ms. Trotter was a member of the U.S. Marine Corps Women&#x27;s Reserve 
from 1944 to 1946. She enlisted within a few weeks of her brother, 
Franklin, who was killed in action in Germany in 1945.
  Ms. Trotter completed basic training at Camp Pendleton, California 
and she remained there to faithfully execute her duties driving a jeep 
for a Major she was assigned to. The only problem was that she didn&#x27;t 
know how to drive. Ms. Trotter and the other 18,000 women that joined 
the Marine Corps Women&#x27;s Reserve didn&#x27;t make excuses, they learned, and 
did their jobs with honor.
  Our Nation stands on the strong shoulders of courageous, determined, 
and resourceful women like Ms. Trotter who answered the call to serve 
our Nation in one of our greatest hours of need. Happy birthday to Miss 
Minnie. She has done Franklin, and this entire Nation proud.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Mr. D&#x27;ESPOSITO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Bobby Kalotee, 
a distinguished civic leader on Long Island who has lived the American 
dream. He came here from India as an immigrant with a desire to serve 
the communities he now called home. For over four decades now, he 
either led or participated in a multitude of community projects, 
organizations and charitable work for the people of not just Nassau 
County but across New York State and beyond. Though he chaired several 
political parties, he never viewed politics as a sport for gain but as 
a vehicle for advocacy and civic duty. He sought to address the issues 
that afflicted countless lives regardless of their zip code of social 
status.
  As a Major in the New York State Guard, Dr. Kalotee serves in the 
Division of Military and Naval Affairs and as a General in the United 
States Disaster Relief Command, which oversees operations that are 
vital to all Long Islanders. Here at home, Dr. Kalotee served as the 
Director and Vice Chair of the Counsel for Stony Brook University&#x27;s 
Brookhaven National Labs and continues to serve on the board of the New 
York Institute of Technology. As the Chairman of the Nassau County 
Human Rights Commission, Dr. Kalotee has even personally witnessed many 
elections both here and abroad and has been invited to attend the 
inaugurations of several esteemed heads of state. As mentioned, Dr. 
Kalotee has also been involved in work overseas, having been appointed 
as a special liaison to South Asia and an advisor to the United 
Nations&#x27; Grenada Mission and providing medical services to over 7,000 
people in cities across Central America. His humanitarian efforts and 
work with the UN even earned him the privilege to be a guest speaker 
before the General Assembly for multiple sessions.
  Dr. Kalotee is an American with a passion to serve and look after his 
communities, a duty of which I understand and appreciate the 
importance. In the words of his organization&#x27;s motto, ``there is no 
better gift one can give to humanity than good health.&#x27;&#x27;
  On behalf of myself and all Long Islanders, we give Bobby, my 
brother, our upmost gratitude for his service.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I proudly join the Greek-Orthodox 
community of Staten Island to honor the service of Father Nicholas 
Petropoulakos and celebrate his retirement this month after 50 years of 
service to the Greek Orthodox Church of America. Therefore, I include 
in the Record the following Proclamation:

       Whereas Father Nicholas Petropoulakos was born in Lowell, 
     Massachusetts, and entered Hellenic College Holy Cross School 
     of Theology in 1967 to fulfill his calling of becoming an 
     Orthodox priest;
       Whereas Father Nicholas was ordained to the Holy Diaconate 
     in 1973 at Holy Cross Chapel on the campus of our seminary by 
     His Eminence, Metropolitan Iakovos of Chicago, and was named 
     assistant to the Pastor of Annunciation Church in Woburn, 
     Massachusetts;
       Whereas on June 1, 1974, he was ordained to the Holy 
     Priesthood at his home Parish, Holy Trinity in Lowell, 
     Massachusetts, again by His Eminence, Metropolitan Iakovos. 
     In 1987, Father Nick received a M.A. in Biblical Theology 
     from the University of Notre Dame;
       Whereas since accepting the pastorate of Holy Trinity--St. 
     Nicholas in August of 1996, Father Nick has been heavily 
     involved in education ministries, leading Bible study 
     sessions, and teaching in youth ministries. He helped develop 
     the parish website further to bring the community together 
     and introduced the Junior Hellenic Dancers as well as a dance 
     ministry for 3- to 6-year-olds;
       Whereas Father Nicholas established the ELEOS Ministry for 
     illness support, organized monthly healing services, and 
     initiated THARROS for divorced Orthodox Christians. He 
     oversaw the completion of the Community Center building 
     program and led the renovation of the church, which was 
     adorned with iconography for its consecration on June 3, 
     2013, conducted by His Eminence Archbishop Demetrios of 
     America.

  On behalf of the Greek-Orthodox community of Staten Island, I want to 
thank Father Nicholas for his years of devotion, dedication, 
commitment, and spiritual guidance.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize a visionary 
advocate and leader in my state who, for decades, has worked to improve 
the lives of her fellow citizens. Over her influential career, Mary 
Henderson has worked as an attorney and co-founded a legal aid and 
economic justice nonprofit--among many other roles--to consistently 
address root causes of poverty.
  Mary&#x27;s advocacy for Maine people began at Pine Tree Legal Assistance, 
a nonprofit organization which provides free civil legal assistance. As 
a staff attorney, Mary tirelessly provided representation on a variety 
of cases. Under Mary&#x27;s guidance, countless people were able to access 
government supports for which they were eligible but had previously 
been improperly denied.
  In 1996, Mary co-founded Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofit civil legal 
aid and economic justice organization. In her role as Executive 
Director, Mary assisted in the acquisition of a location and the 
securing of funds to create a sustainable and reliable resource for 
Maine&#x27;s most vulnerable populations. Through her defense of government 
programs for public healthcare, education access, and housing and food 
security, Mary&#x27;s work has improved the lives of thousands of Maine 
people.
  Since leaving Maine Equal Justice, Mary has brought her expertise and 
unwavering dedication to the Office of Substance Abuse, Maine 
Department of Labor, Office of Maine Care Services, National Academy 
for State Health Policy, Maine Children&#x27;s Alliance, and Preble Street 
Resource Center. In each of her roles, Mary has intentionally centered 
the voices and experiences of the people of Maine who are served by 
these critical government and anti-poverty programs.
  I had the great pleasure of working with Mary during my years in the 
State House and was able to see firsthand how the State of Maine 
benefitted from her knowledge, skills, and advocacy. I am very proud to 
represent her and the State of Maine in Congress. I wish Mary continued 
success, and I wholeheartedly thank her for her many years of 
influential work.

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Promoting National 
Service and Reducing Youth Unemployment Act to address one of the 
greatest workforce tragedies--our unemployed young people--while 
filling vacancies in the public sector. Youth unemployment is harming 
our young people and costing our country billions of dollars each year 
in lost productivity and tax revenue, among other costs. Although the 
total unemployment rate has reached a relative low (3.9 percent), the 
youth unemployment rate is 8.2 percent. These young people have not had 
a fair chance to use the high school or college education we strongly 
urged them to obtain.
  By adding 500,000 new members to AmeriCorps, this bill would need no 
new administrative structure or bureaucracy, and would allow unemployed 
youth to earn a stipend, obtain work experience and develop a good work 
history to help secure future employment. This bill would significantly 
expand job opportunities for young people who have done what they could 
to get a job, but, despite their best efforts, remain unemployed. 
AmeriCorps participants receive a living allowance and are also 
eligible for an education award equal to the value of a Pell grant, 
school-loan forbearance, health care benefits and childcare assistance. 
By expanding AmeriCorps, we would reduce the number of unemployed young 
people, provide them work skills and experience and help understaffed 
state and local governments provide services.
  This bill would also establish that the minimum wage for any 
AmeriCorps State and National member would be 200 percent of the 
federal poverty line, and would not allow for a decrease in that 
amount, as is allowed under current law. AmeriCorps members serve their 
country and gain skills, but we should increase the minimum wage for 
everybody, including national service members.
  For some time, it has been clear that policies to address the most 
stubborn forms of unemployment need to be targeted in order to be 
effective. Without significant targeting, many young people will 
continue to face their first years as adults without jobs and with no 
way to acquire necessary work experience. They deserve a better start 
in life as adults.
  I ask my colleagues to support this urgently needed, targeted 
assistance for our unemployed youth.

                          ____________________

 RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF MR. PATRICK COLLIGAN, PRESIDENT OF THE 
          NEW JERSEY STATE POLICEMAN&#x27;S BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Patrick 
Colligan on his retirement as President of the New Jersey Policeman&#x27;s 
Benevolent Association or New Jersey State PBA. Over his decade-long 
tenure as New Jersey State PBA President, Mr. Colligan has stood out as 
a passionate advocate for law enforcement across the state. Personally, 
he has been a friend and trusted advisor on key bipartisan bills like 
the Invest to

[[Page E580]]

Protect Act. Mr. Colligan&#x27;s tireless advocacy on behalf of New Jersey 
police will be honored and appreciated for years to come.
  Patrick Colligan began his career in law enforcement in August 1992 
at the age of 27 with the Franklin Township Police Department He 
graduated from Class 9-92 of the Somerset County Police Academy, where 
he served as class president and was the recipient of an academy 
leadership award.
  During his law enforcement career, Patrick received more than a dozen 
awards, citations, and commendations. He is a founding member of the 
County Firewatch Program, a preventive program for juvenile fire 
setters. He also is a charter member of the County Arson Task Force. 
During his storied thirty-year career in law enforcement, Patrick has 
worked on and has taken part in thousands of investigations as a 
Detective from thefts to homicides.
  On July 1, 2014, Patrick became President of the 32,000-member-strong 
New Jersey State Policemen&#x27;s Benevolent Association, one of the largest 
in the country. In his capacity as PBA President, Patrick has developed 
very strong relationships throughout New Jersey. Within just a few 
years in his role, Patrick made a significant mark on the organization. 
Since 2017, he has been consistently ranked in the Insider NJ ``100 
Policymaker Power List&#x27;&#x27; and the NJ Globe ``100 Power List.&#x27;&#x27;
  Patrick was appointed by Governor Jon Corzine to the Task Force on 
Police Suicides, which developed a successful video and program to 
curtail what was an alarming trend of police suicides. Governor Corzine 
also appointed him to the New Jersey Public Employment Relations 
Commission (PERC) where he proudly served from 2009 to 2011.
  I salute Mr. Colligan for his steadfast leadership of New Jersey 
State PBA and his lifelong commitment to public service. He has notched 
an amazing record of legislative accomplishments that help keep our 
communities safe and ensure law enforcement have the resources they 
need to protect and serve. Jersey is truly lucky to have Patrick as a 
champion of what I believe are the greatest law enforcement officers in 
the country. I wish him a restful retirement with his wife, Lynette, 
and his wonderful family.

            THANKING TOM COYNE FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE HOUSE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BRYAN STEIL

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 3, 2024

  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, to celebrate his retirement, I rise to thank 
Mr. Tom Coyne for 33 years of outstanding service to the U.S. House of 
Representatives. Tom has served this great institution as a valuable 
employee of the House Chief Administrative Office, both in the Office 
of Logistics &amp; Support, and the Office of Finance. His journey was not 
without its challenges, but his resilience and dedication have been 
unwavering, and we are all the better for it.
  Before embarking on his 33-year journey with the U.S. House of 
Representatives, Tom Coyne dedicated four years of his life to the U S. 
Army, serving with honor in the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, ``The Old 
Guard&#x27;&#x27; Unit. His military service concluded in 1984, and he then 
pursued his passion for numbers, earning a degree in Accounting from 
George Mason University.
  Tom began his career at the House in February 1991 as an equipment 
counselor in the Office Equipment Services, and due to his excellent 
service, he was promoted through many positions, leading up to his role 
as Chief Logistics Officer. Tom assisted with multiple computer system 
implementations, which include the fixed asset and inventory management 
system (FAIMS), work ticketing, point of sale, finance, and online flag 
ordering systems. Additionally, Tom was instrumental in initiating and 
managing the first Office Services department, allowing offices to 
request CAO support and services more quickly.
  For 33 years, Tom&#x27;s logistical, technical, analytical, communication, 
and financial skills have not just served the House, they have enriched 
it. His commitment and dedication have provided a wealth of 
institutional knowledge, resulting in numerous successful initiatives 
and programs. He has been a pillar of support during all significant 
events over the past three decades, such as 9/11, Anthrax, the 
pandemic, 17 Congressional transitions, five Inaugurations, and nine 
House leadership changes. His professionalism, solid presence, and 
unwavering confidence has been a source of reassurance for his team, 
the Chief Administrative Office, and the U.S. House of Representatives.
  While Tom&#x27;s physical presence will be missed in the halls, his legacy 
will continue to guide us. The Logistics &amp; Support employees will 
continue to rely on his example, asking themselves daily, ``What would 
Tom do?&#x27;&#x27; This commitment ensures that the House Members will continue 
to receive the best service, a testament to Tom&#x27;s lasting impact.
  In retirement, Tom looks forward to embarking on new adventures. He 
plans to spend more time exploring the world with his wife, Susan, and 
cherishing family moments with his sons, Tom and wife Amanda, Joe, 
James, and daughter Jennifer. The most recent addition to the family is 
his grandson, Henry, who will undoubtedly bring joy and laughter to 
their lives. Tom is excited about the opportunities and future 
endeavors that retirement will bring, and we wish him all the best in 
his new chapter.
  On behalf of the entire House community, we extend our warmest 
congratulations to Tom Coyne. We celebrate his many years of dedication 
and outstanding contributions to the U.S. House of Representatives. We 
wish Tom many wonderful years in fulfilling his retirement dreams. May 
this new chapter be filled with joy, adventure, and fulfillment.
