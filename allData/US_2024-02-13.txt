 HONORING 100 YEARS OF THE CULPEPER COUNTY VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT, 
                               COMPANY 1

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Culpeper 
Volunteer Fire Department, Company 1 for their 100 years of dedicated 
service toward their mission to aid in the preservation and protection 
of life and property from and during fires, and their commitment to the 
Culpeper community.
  The Culpeper Volunteer Fire Department was born from a desire to help 
neighbors in need. Chartered in January 1924, the department was first 
led by Chief J. William Swan and was comprised of 19 volunteers ready 
to answer the call. In their early days, they relied on their 1923 
American LaFrance Brockway ``Torpedo&#x27;&#x27; Engine, which they housed on the 
ground floor of the Municipal Building. Volunteer firefighters used 
canvas coats with leather gloves bought at local hardware stores, and 
some donned World War I metal helmets or construction helmets to fight 
fires. It was not until the early 1950s that Culpeper volunteer 
firefighters got their first official fireproof gear. Soon after, they 
relocated to West Davis Street where they are still located today.
  The Culpeper Volunteer Fire Department is a unique and treasured 
organization. Made up completely of volunteers from all walks of life, 
these brave individuals respond to emergencies in their community in 
their spare time. Through their service, they provide fire protection 
and life-saving aid to more than 54,000 Culpeper County residents and 
cover 383 square miles.
  What began as a dream to help their neighbors has grown into a strong 
organization that continues to uphold the founding mission set 100 
years ago--``to provide emergency services to the citizens of our 
entire community . . . achieved through our principles of commitment, 
education, recognized standards, and professionalism.&#x27;&#x27; Today they 
boast a membership of 65 volunteer firefighters. In 2023, they answered 
913 calls with a fleet composed of an engine, a pumper, a rescue 
engine, and more, all purchased with the help of their community 
through fundraising and donations.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending the work 
and commitment to services that Culpeper Volunteer Fire Department, 
Company 1 has carried out over the last 100 years. Their service to the 
community is invaluable, and I wish them the best as they continue 
their work to help our neighbors when they most need it.

  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an esteemed and 
invaluable member of New Jersey&#x27;s Ninth Congressional District, Mr. 
Huseyin Bayram. His contributions to our community distinguish him as a 
prominent figure, serving as the proud owner of Toro&#x27;s Restaurant and 
the New Corral. Today I join the City of Paterson as they honor his 
contributions by awarding him with the Key to the City. Huseyin is an 
outstanding community leader, philanthropist, and entrepreneur who 
continuously demonstrates an unwavering commitment to make a positive 
impact extending beyond the State of New Jersey.

[[Page E143]]

  For over three decades, Huseyin Bayram has been active in the City of 
Paterson. His entrepreneurial spirit is embodied in the success of the 
New Corral in Clifton and the Toro&#x27;s Restaurants, located in Paterson, 
Clifton, and Montclair. The Toro&#x27;s Restaurant of Paterson is an iconic 
dining establishment that opened its doors in 1972.
  Mr. Bayram&#x27;s compassionate philanthropy created numerous local 
initiatives, including his donation of over 10,000 meals to community 
members during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Huseyin wanted to show 
his appreciation for frontline healthcare workers by providing free 
meals to doctors and nurses at three hospitals in New York. Huseyin 
played a critical role in spearheading and organizing relief efforts 
for the earthquake of Turkey in 2023. Huseyin&#x27;s efforts have not only 
enhanced our community&#x27;s well-being but also fostered a spirit of unity 
and cooperation among its members.
  Mr. Bayram led 150,000 members as the President of the Turkish 
American Giresun Organization, representing the largest Turkish 
population in the United States. In 2017, the City of Paterson 
appointed Huseyin as Deputy Mayor under Mayor Jane Williams-Warren 
establishing his role in local governance. Furthermore, he holds the 
position of Vice-President with the Turkish-American Federation of New 
York and the Paterson Mevlana Mosque, showcasing how the Turkish 
community places their trust in his leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and 
the residents of the City of Paterson in recognizing Mr. Bayram. I take 
this opportunity to honor the great work Huseyin Bayram has 
accomplished. May his work continue to be a guiding light in our 
community and inspire others to strive for excellence in service.

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a 
remarkable public servant who dedicated his life to law enforcement, 
Sheriff Richard Berdnik. Sheriff Berdnik served twenty-eight years with 
the Clifton Police Department. After his time with the City of Clifton, 
he joined the County of Passaic as the Commander of the Juvenile 
Division and the SWAT Team. On January 1, 2011, Richard was elected to 
the role of Passaic County Sheriff. A prominent leader among law 
enforcement, Sheriff Berdnik was also a member of the FBI National 
Academy Associates, the New Jersey Honor Legion of Decorated Officers, 
and the International Chiefs of Police Association.
  A native of Clifton, New Jersey, Richard Berdnik graduated from 
Clifton High School, the New Jersey State Police Academy, FBI National 
Academy, and FBI National Executive Institute. Sheriff Berdnik took 
criminal justice courses at Seton Hall University, the University of 
Virginia, and Caldwell College. Sheriff

Berdnik&#x27;s legacy embodies the principle of service over self. His 
impact is woven into the fabric of the Ninth Congressional District, 
exemplified by the officers he mentored, and the countless individuals 
he helped.
  Beyond his professional achievements, Sheriff Berdnik was a beloved 
figure in our community. He was a Parishioner and Eucharistic Minister 
at Saint Andrew&#x27;s Church in Clifton, New Jersey. As a proud member of 
the Polish community, Sheriff Berdnik served as the Marshal for the 
Passaic-Clifton &amp; Vicinity Contingent in the Pulaski Day Parade in 2011 
and was the Grand Marshal of the Pulaski Day Parade in New York City in 
2014.
  Known for his unwavering commitment to justice and the well-being of 
the public, Sheriff Berdnik served as a beacon of bravery and 
compassion. Under his leadership, Richard emphasized the importance of 
community engagement and proactive policing in order to build trust 
with the residents of Passaic County. His innovative approach undertook 
a complete top to bottom review of the department effectively 
streamlining operations within the Patrol, Corrections and Courthouse 
Divisions.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and 
the residents of New Jersey in recognizing Sheriff Richard Berdnik for 
his outstanding contributions to law enforcement and beyond. I thank 
Sheriff Berdnik. He was a mentor, a friend, and a pillar in our 
community. God bless his soul and may his wife Monica, and four 
children Ashley, Ryan, Alyssa, and Kevin stand proud.

                      HONORING THE CITY OF PASSAIC

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with immense pride and joy to 
recognize a significant milestone as the City of Passaic celebrates its 
150th anniversary. Since the city&#x27;s incorporation in 1873, Passaic has 
evolved from a humble settlement into a vibrant and diverse urban 
center that stands as a beacon of progress. This historic achievement 
is a testament to the resilience, growth, and community spirit that 
have defined the City of Passaic over the past century and a half.
  The industrious spirit of Passaic&#x27;s residents has been the driving 
force behind its success. From the early days of fabric mills to the 
present, the people of Passaic have worked together to build a city 
that fosters innovation, economic prosperity, and cultural diversity. 
Let us reflect on the rich history, enduring spirit, and remarkable 
growth as we commemorate the sesquicentennial anniversary of the City 
of Passaic.
  The Lenni-Lenape Native Americans are the earliest recorded 
inhabitants of the area situated in the City of Passaic. The Lenni-
Lenape were met by Hartman Michielsen Vreeland, a Dutch settler and 
trader, who purchased Dundee Island and Pulaski Park along the Passaic 
River on April 4, 1678. The Dutch settlement expanded its land through 
further deeds and purchases over the next decade. In 1693, the Dutch 
settlement incorporated as the Township of Acquackanonk as part of 
northern Essex County.
  The Township of Acquackanonk was later moved to Passaic County after 
being formed in 1837 by combining parts of northern Essex County and 
western Bergen County. In 1869 the Township of Acquackanonk officially 
changed its name to the City of Passaic. As the area experienced 
population and commercial growth, community members voted to 
incorporate as the City of Passaic in 1873.
  Following the incorporation, the City of Passaic experienced an 
industrial boom fueled by immigration from European countries. By the 
late 19th century, critical developments such as the construction of 
the Erie Railroad helped Passaic become an economic hub with 
flourishing manufacturing and commerce. The city established a diverse 
economy with a thriving textile industry producing silk and cotton.
  Today, there are nearly 70,000 residents that call the City of 
Passaic their home. The city has a large immigrant population and is a 
melting pot evident through the array of multi-cultural businesses, 
restaurants, and community events. Throughout Passaic&#x27;s history, 
community leaders and residents played a key role in shaping Passaic 
into the exceptional city we celebrate today. One of Passaic&#x27;s most 
notable figures is Mayor Hector C. Lora. His leadership and wisdom 
continue to guide the City of Passaic through all challenges, always 
emerging stronger.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and 
the residents of New Jersey in recognizing the 150th anniversary of the 
City of Passaic. I take this opportunity to congratulate the residents 
of Passaic on this historic milestone. May this celebration serve as a 
moment to honor the past, revel in the present, and look forward to a 
future filled with continued growth, prosperity, and fortitude.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and service of Dr. Clinton Battle.
  Born in the 1920s, Dr. Clinton Battle was known for his remarkable 
medical service to Indianola, Mississippi that contributed to the 
medical field where he earned nationwide recognition.
  In the 1950s Dr. Battle received national press for his renowned 
delivery of first conjoined Siamese twins to ever be successfully 
separated.
  Outside of the medical field, Battle helped to revive the local 
chapter of The National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People (NAACP), helping over 100 African Americans register to vote.
  He always inspired African Americans to rise during the Jim Crow era. 
Because of this contribution to civil rights and medicine, Dr. Clinton 
Battle has been named a recipient of the Civil Rights Trail Marker as a 
trailblazer for Civil Rights and his medical accomplishments.
  Dr. Battle&#x27;s legacy and his contribution to medicine will continue to 
transcend time.
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the late 
Dr. Clinton Battle for his dedication to medicine and Civil Rights.

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mary 
Louise Orta as her family gathers to remember her life and the many 
people she touched along the way.
  Mary Louise Orta was the matriarch of the Orta Family. She was born 
in New Braunfels, Texas on November 13, 1931. She met and married 
Albert Orta in 1949 and began their life together in Texas before 
moving to California in 1973.
  Mrs. Orta was a military spouse who exemplified the virtues of 
family, commitment, and service. She supported her husband Albert&#x27;s 
career as he served our nation in the United States Air Force, then as 
an employee of the Department of Defense while traveling to several 
countries until his retirement in 1980. During this time, Mary remained 
home and continued her own life of service by supporting his career and 
raising their 12 children.
  In 1981, at age 50, as her youngest child entered kindergarten, Mrs. 
Orta joined the workforce volunteering at the local school. Soon 
thereafter, she was hired by the Elk Grove Unified School District as a 
full-time employee at Valley High School in Sacramento County where she 
remained until her retirement in 2001. She was a tireless contributor 
to her school community, always first to volunteer and never wavered 
when asked to help. Throughout her twenty-year career, Mrs. Orta 
received several recognitions and was honored by the California State 
Senate and at districtwide ceremonies for her many contributions to 
staff, school administration, and students at Valley High School.
  Mary Orta was a remarkable woman. She was a loving and devoted wife, 
mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She enjoyed the simple 
pleasures of life, finding joy in the company of family and close 
friends. She proudly walked with school administration at high school 
graduations, supported her children and grandchildren at events and 
family gatherings. Her unwavering love for those she cared for was her 
driving force and her faith, kindness and compassion will undoubtedly 
be a continuing source of strength for her family.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mary Louise 
Orta as her family gathers to honor her incredible life and legacy.

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleague, 
Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congressman Mark DeSaulnier, to honor the 
life and legacy of Mayor Irma Anderson, a trailblazing leader within 
Contra Costa County and devout public servant. Mayor Anderson, who 
passed away at the age of 93, leaves behind an indelible legacy as a 
mayor, nurse, and community advocate.
  Born and raised in Boston, Mayor Anderson&#x27;s passion for public 
service began at a young age. After serving as Student Body President 
and Valedictorian of her high school, she became one of the first Black 
students to attend and graduate from Cornell School of Nursing. In 
1959, Mayor Anderson moved to Richmond, California with her husband, 
Reverend Booker T. Anderson, Jr., beginning a lifelong residency in the 
Contra Costa County community.
  Fueled by her passion for service and sincere belief in caring for 
those around her, Mayor Anderson worked diligently for the Contra Costa 
County Health Department for 20 years. She eventually became the first 
Black Assistant Director and Director of Public Health Nursing in 
Contra Costa County, and her unwavering leadership undeniably improved 
her community.
  Following her extensive career in public health, Mayor Anderson&#x27;s 
commitment to service led her to run for Richmond City Council. In 
1993, she became the first Black woman to serve as a Richmond City 
Council Member. After two successful terms on the Richmond City 
Council, Mayor Anderson made history yet again in 2001, when she became 
the first Black woman to be elected mayor of a major California city.
  Mayor Anderson&#x27;s career in public service was characterized by her 
spirit for advocacy and commitment to giving a voice to the 
unrepresented. She developed a historic partnership with the West 
Contra Costa Unified School District, founding Kids! First, which 
cultivates and expands after-school programs throughout Richmond. In 
addition, she held the ``Richmond Rises Above Violence Conference,&#x27;&#x27; 
which galvanized Richmond&#x27;s public health approach to violence 
prevention. Subsequently, Richmond created an Office of Violence 
Prevention, later the Office of Neighborhood Safety, a nationally 
recognized violence intervention strategy.
  Mayor Anderson&#x27;s spirit of innovation was expressed both through her 
critical leadership and vital work as Metropolitan Transportation 
Committee Commissioner. She spearheaded efforts to advance multiple 
bridge rehabilitation and expansion projects, helping ensure Contra 
Costa County&#x27;s roads were safe and secure. During her tenure as Mayor 
and Commissioner, Mayor Anderson presided over the transformation of 
downtown Richmond into a model of transit-oriented development.
  Mayor Anderson will be remembered for her decades of service to 
Contra Costa County and her genuine spirit of kindness and compassion. 
She impacted the lives of countless community members and her steadfast 
leadership, constant smile, and patient mentorship brought comfort to 
all who knew her. Mayor Anderson&#x27;s enduring spirit will live on in her 
son and the community she dedicated her life to serving. We would like 
to extend our deepest sympathies to Mayor Anderson&#x27;s loved ones. We 
know they and the people of Contra Costa County will join us in 
celebrating her life and legacy.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Equal Federal Funding 
for the District of Columbia Act, which would amend title 1 of the 
United States Code to deem the District of Columbia as both a state and 
political subdivision of a state (such as a city or county) for the 
purpose of eligibility for federal funding, unless otherwise provided 
in a statute. D.C. operates as the functional equivalent of a state, 
city and county, and D.C. residents pay all federal taxes. Therefore, 
D.C. deserves to be eligible for federal funding available for each 
level of government.
  While federal statutes generally expressly treat D.C. as a state for 
federal funding--and

[[Page E144]]

most federal grants go to states--federal statutes that provide federal 
funding directly to political subdivisions are often silent on whether 
D.C. is to be treated as a political subdivision. In the absence of 
clear language in a statute, federal agencies are inconsistent in their 
treatment of D.C.&#x27;s eligibility for federal funding.
  By amending title 1 of the U.S. Code to deem D.C. as both a state and 
political subdivision for federal funding, this bill would 
automatically correct imprecise treatment of D.C.&#x27;s eligibility for 
federal funding in existing and future statutes and remove discretion 
from federal agencies in their treatment of D.C.&#x27;s eligibility for 
federal funding.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

                RECOGNIZING DR. JEFFREY BEAUVAIS, Ph.D.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition and 
appreciation of Dr. Jeffrey Beauvais, Ph.D. upon his completion of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s (NOAA) John A. Knauss 
Marine Policy Fellowship Program. Dr. Beauvais served as a Knauss 
fellow in my Washington, D.C. office from February 2023 until February 
2024.
  As an integral member of my legislative staff, Dr. Beauvais assisted 
my work on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
particularly my work on the Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment and the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public 
Buildings, and Emergency Management. Over the past twelve months, he 
worked closely with the Committee and the rest of my personal office 
staff in developing several pieces of critical legislation.
  Dr. Beauvais overhauled my ``FEMA Disaster Preparedness Improvement 
Act&#x27;&#x27; from the 116th Congress to include new, novel reforms to federal 
programs for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. He also 
developed new legislation, the ``Abandoned and Derelict Vessel Removal 
Act of 2024,&#x27;&#x27; in response to a blue-ribbon report by the Pacific 
States&#x27; Oil Spill Task Force published on January 14, 2020. Among other 
key reforms, this new legislation would unlock more than $1.5 billion 
annually in dedicated federal funding under the Oil Spill Liability 
Trust Fund to remove abandoned and derelict vessels from federally 
regulated waterways. I expect to introduce both bills in the coming 
months, thanks in no small part to his work.
  Dr. Beauvais received his doctorate in integrative conservation and 
ecology from the University of Georgia, Athens in 2022, and graduated 
with honors from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of 
Science in biology in 2015. I expect Dr. Beauvais&#x27; fellowship in my 
office will inspire and inform his future endeavors with his passion 
for his native coastal Georgia a recurring theme throughout his career 
and life.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of California&#x27;s eighth 
Congressional district, I extend our deepest appreciation to Dr. 
Beauvais for his dedicated service as a Knauss fellow. He will always 
remain a deeply valued member of Team Garamendi.

                       RECOGNIZING MS. KAREN KING

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DAVID G. VALADAO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Karen King 
for her dedicated service to the California public transit industry and 
to congratulate her on her well-earned retirement from the Golden 
Empire Transit District. Ms. King&#x27;s career in public transit began in 
1976 at the Utah Transit Authority. Ten years later, Ms. King joined 
Long Beach Transit as a Grants Administrator. She quickly moved up the 
leadership ranks, and in 1995 was named Executive Director of 
Transportation. In 1998, Ms. King worked for the North San Diego County 
Transit Development as the Director of Development and Communications 
Services and was selected as the agency&#x27;s Executive Director in 2001. 
In 2008, Ms. King moved to Bakersfield where she became the Chief 
Executive Officer of the Golden Empire Transit District. During her 
tenure as CEO, Ms. King has been steadfast in her commitment to meeting 
the transportation needs of all Bakersfield residents. She helped 
develop and implement the On-Demand Microtransit service program, which 
was first piloted in southwest Bakersfield and has since expanded 
across the city. The program increases transportation access for all 
residents by offering low-cost transportation to residents traveling to 
popular destinations in the city. Ms. King has directed other 
initiatives including a partnership with Kern Health Systems to provide 
rides to appointments for the more than 300,000 members of Kern Family 
Health Care. Ms. King is also coordinating the Long Range Operational 
Service Analysis, which aims to improve local transportation and return 
ridership to pre-pandemic levels. Ms. King has been recognized at the 
local, state, and national levels for her leadership in the public 
transit industry. She is the Vice Chair of the California Transit 
Association (CTA) and in 2021, was selected for a two-year term as 
Chair.
  Ms. King has also served as Chair of the CTA&#x27;s COVID-19 Relief Task 
Force, where she has helped California&#x27;s public transit industry 
recover from the pandemic. In 2018, Ms. King received a Distinguished 
Service Award from the CTA, to celebrate her distinguished career and 
outstanding contributions. This year, Ms. King is receiving the CTA&#x27;s 
award for Innovation and Resiliency, to celebrate her commitment to the 
innovation of the industry and well-being of all Bakersfield commuters. 
Ms. King&#x27;s many accomplishments are a true testament to her character 
and leadership. I&#x27;m confident that her service to the Golden Empire 
Transit District and her passion for improving public transit for all 
residents of our community will have a lasting impact for generations 
to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in thanking Ms. King for her more than 40 years of dedicated 
service to the public transit industry and wishing her a happy and 
well-deserved retirement.

  Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to 
The Lighthouse Community Hospice, and its founder Jocelyn Campbell as 
they host their Annual ``Covered in Love&#x27;&#x27; Gala.
  Ms. Campbell has devoted over 20 years to end-of-life care, working 
as an advocate for the preservation of dignity and compassion for those 
approaching the end of their lives. In her role as the Chief Executive 
Officer of The Lighthouse Community Hospice, Ms. Campbell serves as a

dedicated and hardworking group of healthcare professionals and takes 
part in strategic partnership and planning in order to ensure that 
their programs reach their maximum potential. In 2023, the Lighthouse 
Community Hospice served as a signature community resource at the 52nd 
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Caucus in our 
nation&#x27;s capital. In addition to her role as CEO of the Lighthouse 
Community Hospice, Campbell simultaneously serves as the CEO of Health 
Comply AI. Through her work at Health Comply AI, she is able to balance 
her expertise in cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies with 
her passion for high standard health care delivery, in developing AI-
driven solutions for administering healthcare services and 
organizations.
  The Lighthouse Community Hospice helps to alleviate the difficult, 
emotional experience that is caring for a loved one who is near death. 
They adopt a dedicated and compassionate approach to the work that they 
do, helping each family to develop a plan that centers around 
preserving the dignity and wishes of the individual approaching eternal 
rest.
  I am humbled to acknowledge The Lighthouse Community Hospice and Ms. 
Jocelyn Campbell in their global caregiver advocacy movement for end-
of-life initiatives. The tireless, dedicated, and consistent work that 
they do continue to profoundly impact the ways in which end-of-life 
care is approached and administered both within our community and 
beyond.

         TRIBUTE TO THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF THE SUMGAIT POGROM

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 13, 2024

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 36th anniversary 
of the pogrom

[[Page E142]]

against the Armenian residents of Sumgait, Azerbaijan. From February 27 
to 29, 1988, Azerbaijani mobs assaulted and killed Armenians, leaving 
dozens of Armenian civilians dead and hundreds injured. Women and girls 
were raped, and some victims were burned alive after being tortured and 
beaten. Those who survived the carnage fled their homes and businesses, 
leaving behind all but the clothes on their backs.
  In a pattern all too familiar to the Armenian people, the Azerbaijani 
authorities made little effort to punish those responsible, instead 
attempting to cover up the atrocities in Sumgait to this day, as well 
as denying the role of senior government officials in instigating the 
violence.
  In the years that followed this unspeakable massacre, Armenians 
living in Kirovabad, Baku, and Maragha suffered a similar fate. These 
pogroms were part of a pattern of hateful, racist anti-Armenian 
propaganda and activities occurring throughout Azerbaijan, dehumanizing 
its Armenian residents, and laying the groundwork for decades of 
aggression and mass violence. This brutality culminated when the 
Azerbaijani government initiated war against the people of Nagorno-
Karabakh, also known as Artsakh.
  Beginning on September 27, 2020, and over 44 days, Azerbaijani forces 
invaded and murdered innocent Armenians in Artsakh and displaced tens 
of thousands more. They continued to terrorize the people of Artsakh in 
subsequent military attacks, and by blocking the Lachin Corridor--which 
left 120,000 people without access to food, water, medical supplies and 
services, gas, and electricity for over 9 months. On September 19, 
2023, the Aliyev regime took full advantage of a people they had 
systematically starved, and launched a large-scale attack, further 
escalating their ethnic cleansing and genocidal campaign against the 
indigenous Armenian people of Artsakh. At least 200 people were killed, 
400 wounded, over 100,000 ethnic Armenians were forcibly displaced, and 
Azerbaijan now holds Artsakh&#x27;s political and military leadership, 
civilians, and prisoners of war hostage. With no help from the 
international community to confront Azerbaijan&#x27;s military aggression, 
Artsakh was forced to negotiate under duress and consequently agreed to 
dissolve their democratically elected government.
  There is also real and growing concern that Aliyev has his eyes set 
on land beyond Artsakh and will continue to seek further territory and 
concessions from Armenia by force. To this day, Azerbaijani forces 
remain present on sovereign Armenian land, in violation of Armenia&#x27;s 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and last month, President Aliyev 
made alarming remarks, including his refusal to remove troops from 
Armenian territory. These are the horrific consequences when aggression 
and hatred grow unchecked and when Aliyev&#x27;s hostility is met with 
deafening silence, emboldening him to continue, and expand, his 
unprovoked attacks on the Armenian people, knowing there will be no 
repercussions.
  Azerbaijan&#x27;s campaign of death and destruction against Armenians have 
been nothing short of deplorable, including the destruction of 
religious and cultural sites in Artsakh to erase or falsify history, 
and the torture, mutilation and killing of Armenian civilians, 
prisoners of war and soldiers. This February also marks 20 years of a 
horrific crime when Ramil Safarov, an Azerbaijani army captain savagely 
murdered an Armenian army lieutenant, Gurgen Margaryan with an axe 
while he slept. The two were participating in a NATO Partnership for 
Peace exercise at the time in Hungary. In 2012, Safarov was sent home 
to Azerbaijan, purportedly to serve out the remainder of his sentence. 
Instead, he was pardoned, promoted, and paraded through the streets of 
Baku as a returning hero. There is no more dramatic illustration of 
Azerbaijan&#x27;s continued posture of hatred towards their Armenian 
neighbor than their celebration of a cold-blooded murderer.
  Though the United States and international partners have condemned 
Azerbaijan&#x27;s aggression and military assault against Armenians, the 
time for strong statements alone has clearly long passed. Condemnation 
must be followed by real consequences. The United States must hold 
Azerbaijan and its leadership accountable and take concrete action and 
press Azerbaijan to return to compliance with international law and 
order. Crimes against humanity cannot be ignored and cannot go 
unanswered.
  The United States must use its immense bully pulpit to apply direct 
pressure to the Aliyev regime in Azerbaijan, by enforcing restrictions 
on additional military assistance to Baku pursuant to Section 907 and 
calling on Azerbaijan to immediately return all Armenian POWs, 
hostages, and other detainees, and provide information on the status of 
those still be detained or missing. Additionally, the Biden 
Administration should immediately implement sanctions under the 
Magnitsky Act against Azeri officials responsible for human rights 
abuses.
  The United States must also demand an immediate withdrawal of Azeri 
forces from the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia, provide 
security assistance to Armenia including expanding humanitarian aid to 
assist Artsakh refugees, and help ensure the safety and security of 
Armenians who seek to return to their homes in Artsakh. Finally, the 
U.S. Department of State must continue to call attention to the 
destruction and desecration of Armenian religious and cultural sites by 
Azerbaijan, and urge their safeguarding and preservation. Only by using 
every diplomatic tool at their disposal, including sanctions, against 
Azerbaijan can we help guarantee the safety, security and continued 
territorial integrity of Armenia.
  As we pause to remember the innocent victims of the pogroms, we are 
also reminded that despite the trials the Armenian people have faced, 
it has not broken their faith, determination, and their will to survive 
in the face of constant threats from Azerbaijan. Today, let us recommit 
ourselves to doing everything we can to bring peace and justice to our 
Armenian brothers and sisters abroad, once and for all.
