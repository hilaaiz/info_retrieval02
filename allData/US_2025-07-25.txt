        CONDEMNING CHAOTIC AND HARMFUL FAILINGS OF THIS CONGRESS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. STEVE COHEN

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, we are going to adjourn and not do the 
peoples&#x27; business because we have thus far gotten an ``F.&#x27;&#x27; An ``F&#x27;&#x27; 
for the work of the people in this Congress. We have taken health care 
away from hundreds of thousands of people. We have taken SNAP payments 
and nutritional sustenance, away from tens and hundreds of thousands of 
people. We have made injuries to the Earth, God&#x27;s Earth we are here to 
preserve, and we only use. We have taken away from women the right to 
go to Planned Parenthood to have health care that they need. We have 
taken away protections for clean energy to change the rate of growth of 
global warming that affects our planet and affects our future with 
hotter and hotter summers, flash floods, fires and disasters. It will 
increase our reliance on fossil fuels, which make the air dirtier and 
people sicker, all while we are taking away people&#x27;s health care. This 
Congress has earned an ``F.&#x27;&#x27; We do not deserve a better grade.
  I am ashamed to be a part of this Congress, but I will stay because 
people need to stand up, speak the truth, stand up for things the 
American people have always stood for: justice, due process, the rule 
of law, fairness, caring about the little guy, caring about giving 
people something when they need it, but not giving something to people 
who have too much--millionaires and billionaires.
  Just think, Mr. Speaker, of the harm the rescissions bill did to 
public broadcasting--NPR and PBS--legacies of President Johnson&#x27;s Great 
Society that help our citizens stay informed. Think of the harm done to 
life-saving foreign aid that keeps children fed and vaccinated from 
dreadful diseases that can and will cross our borders in check. And the 
Big Ugly Bill does substantial harm to critical programs and to the 
people who rely on them, so millionaires can get a tax break and the 
rest of the country gets huge and endless deficits and trillions more 
in debt.
  Newsweek reported this week that the current Congress is one of the 
least effective ever, passing only 27 bills since January 3, far fewer 
than in previous Congresses at the same point. Unfortunately, the 
biggest, ugliest bill we passed, and the rescissions package will 
contribute to incalculable pain, suffering, and death all around the 
world.
  Come to think of it, maybe this Congress should get something worse 
than a grade of ``F.&#x27;&#x27; Maybe those voting for these cruel and dangerous 
provisions should be sent to the principal&#x27;s office and expelled.

                          ____________________

  The Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs Solano County&#x27;s

                                                   John Garamendi,


                                       United States Congress,

     Re 10th Annual Anniversary and Celebration of Young Leaders

     APAPA Solano County Chapter
     Vallejo, CA.
       Dear APAPA-SOC and 2025 APAPA-SOC Interns, It is with great 
     pleasure that I congratulate the Asian Pacific Islander 
     American Public Affairs Solano County Chapter (APAPA-SOC) for 
     another year of exemplary service and join you in celebrating 
     your 10th Annual Anniversary and Celebration of Young Leaders 
     banquet. Reaching this important milestone is a true 
     testament to your organization&#x27;s dedication, perseverance and 
     commitment to excellence. APAPA-SOC&#x27;s continuous efforts to 
     empower Asian and Pacific Islander Americans by encouraging 
     civic participation through leadership and mentorship 
     programs, internships, and scholarships deserve the highest 
     commendation. Over the past decade APAPA-SOC has

[[Page E731]]

     made a lasting impact on our community and uplifted many 
     young leaders across the country and in California&#x27;s Eighth 
     Congressional District. APAPA&#x27;s work is making great strides 
     toward creating a more perfect Union.
       Civic participation is critical to upholding our democratic 
     ideals, and I am thrilled to see APAPA-SOC working so 
     actively on this mission. Asian and Pacific Islander 
     Americans&#x27; representation at all levels of government is 
     necessary to ensure that the Asian and Pacific Islander 
     community is properly acknowledged and advocated for. 
     Throughout APAPA-SOC&#x27;s ten years, its ability to empower 
     Asian and Pacific Islander Americans of all ages has left its 
     community a legacy that promotes civic engagement at the 
     local, state, and national levels of government. It is my 
     greatest hope that the APAPA-SOC Chapter continues to prosper 
     in the years ahead. I look forward to seeing APAPA-SOC 
     interns grow into tomorrow&#x27;s leaders of California and 
     beyond.
       The APAPA-SOC&#x27;s 10th Anniversary and Celebration of Young 
     Leaders banquet is sure to be a wonderful celebration of all 
     the hard work and dedication APAPA-SOC interns have put into 
     strengthening our democracy. As you celebrate this 
     anniversary, I hope you take pride in how far your APAPA-SOC 
     has come and feel inspired by the continued journey ahead. On 
     behalf of California&#x27;s Eighth Congressional District, please 
     accept my gratitude for the good you have done, and continue 
     to do, in our district and my best wishes for continued 
     success in all of APAPA-SOC&#x27;s future endeavors.
           Sincerely,
                                                   John Garamendi,
                                               Member of Congress.

  CONGRATULATING THE WEST BROWNSVILLE LITTLE LEAGUE&#x27;S SENIOR TEAM ON 
                  WINNING THE TEXAS WEST CHAMPIONSHIP

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride 
that I rise today to recognize the inspiring young women from the West 
Brownsville Little League&#x27;s Senior Team, aged 15-16, for their 
astonishing achievement in finishing as runner-up as they competed for 
a spot in the 2025 Little League World Series.
  Representing our community to the nation is an unseen achievement in 
the past 73 years of the team&#x27;s history in Brownsville. Competing in 
softball takes dexterity and discipline, but most importantly, 
sacrifice. A tremendous commitment has been made by the participants 
and their families as they worked towards this exciting goal. They are 
showing the country the hard work and team spirit that South Texans 
have always represented.
  These young women have made their community, families, coaches and 
friends immensely proud, and I encourage them to continue supporting 
each other in the games ahead. But most importantly, I encourage them 
to cherish every moment as they are making history in The Rio Grande 
Valley. Rest assured I am cheering for you every step of the way.
  Mr. Speaker, our West Brownsville Little League Senior Softball Team 
has made all of us immensely proud.

                          ____________________

          DESIGNATING NIGERIA A COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the 
following letter, drafted by respected experts--including former 
Members of Congress--in the field of religious freedom, underscoring 
the dire state of religious freedom in Nigeria, and calling for that 
country to be designated a Country of Particular Concern under the 
International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. Their stark appraisal of 
the situation, and the immediate threat to the lives of thousands of 
Nigerians, merits immediate action by the administration.

                                                    June 13, 2025.
     Hon. Christopher Smith,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative Smith: As religious freedom advocates 
     and leaders of grassroots organizations with millions of 
     American members, we thank you for sponsoring H. Res. 220 
     which recommends redesignating Nigeria as a Country of 
     Particular Concern (CPC) for particularly severe religious 
     persecution. We consider this a critical first step in 
     addressing the situation in Nigeria.
       As you know, House Resolution 220 calls for the Secretary 
     of State to address the egregious, systematic, and ongoing 
     religious persecution, in Nigeria, specifically by 
     redesignating Nigeria as a CPC under the International 
     Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (IRFA).
       Nigeria is the world&#x27;s deadliest country for Christians, 
     according to Open Doors&#x27; 2025 World Watch List. Of the 4,476 
     Christians killed for their faith worldwide during the 
     reporting period, 3,100 (69 percent) were in Nigeria. FIDES, 
     a Catholic news agency, indicated that over ten years least 
     145 priests had been abducted and eleven murdered.
       In addition, designated terror groups such as Boko Haram 
     and the Islamic State West Africa Province have killed 
     thousands of Christians and Muslims who reject their dictates 
     and suppressed the rights of women and girls. Boko Haram 
     kidnapped over 200 schoolgirls in 2014 in Chibok, Borno 
     State, half of whom remain captive, forced them into sexual 
     slavery and pressured them to convert to Islam. In another 
     case, Leah Sharibu remains enslaved following a 2018 
     terrorist raid on her school.
       Most of this slaughter, however, is carried out by militant 
     Fulani Muslim herders, who have been allowed to target 
     Christian villages with impunity. In its recommendation of 
     CPC designation for Nigeria, the U.S. Commission on 
     International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) concluded in its 
     2021 Annual Report that the Nigerian Government has 
     ``routinely failed to investigate these attacks and prosecute 
     those responsible, demonstrating a problematic level of 
     apathy on the part of state officials.&#x27;&#x27;
       Christians who are violently attacked and whose land is 
     confiscated by the militant Fulani Muslim herders, end up 
     living in Internally Displaced People (IDP) camps, which are 
     unspeakably inhumane and unfit for animals. Currently there 
     are well over 2 million people living in such camps in the 
     Makurdi diocese alone. The Pontifical foundation, Aid to the 
     Church in Need, which works to help the Church in areas of 
     high distress in Nigeria, has collected this video evidence 
     from Makurdi of Christians living in such camps.
       Authorities also enforce Islamic blasphemy laws that have 
     resulted in recent death sentences for Sufi musician, Yahaya 
     Sharif-Aminu, and two Muslim clerics, and ``religious 
     insult&#x27;&#x27; laws that led to a 24-year sentence for Nigeria&#x27;s 
     Humanist Association head, Mubarak Bala. These laws have also 
     been accompanied by a routine grant of impunity for 
     extrajudicial attacks against their perceived violators. In 
     2023, there was the unprosecuted mob killing of student 
     Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu after she was accused of blasphemy 
     and the unprosecuted serious death threats against the Sultan 
     of Sokoto. Sokoto&#x27;s Catholic bishop, and Rhoda Jatau, a 
     Christian woman, all three of whom were targeted for 
     expressing disapproval of Yakubu&#x27;s murder.
       On March 13, 2025 the House Foreign Affairs&#x27; Subcommittee 
     on Africa held the hearing: ``Conflict and Persecution in 
     Nigeria; The Case for a CPC,&#x27;&#x27; with Catholic Bishop Wilfred 
     Anagbe of the Makurdi diocese in Benue State, Nina Shea, 
     Hudson Institute&#x27;s Senior Fellow and Director of its Center 
     for Religious Freedom, and Family Research Council&#x27;s 
     President Tony Perkins--all testifying to the medieval-like 
     persecution currently targeting Christians in Nigeria&#x27;s 
     Middle Belt region.
       Ms. Shea stated that ``Nigeria&#x27;s government has not 
     undertaken a thorough, objective, and transparent 
     investigation of the militant Fulani herders&#x27; organization, 
     leadership, motives, or intent in these attacks.&#x27;&#x27; Yet, Shea 
     noted, ``[s]urvivor accounts, collected by churches and 
     journalists on the ground, frequently report that their 
     attackers spoke Fulfulde and shouted `Allahu Akbar&#x27; or other 
     religious sentiments as they killed, as USCIRF noted in its 
     reports.&#x27;&#x27;
       Following the recent congressional hearing and subsequent 
     international scrutiny, Nigeria&#x27;s President, Foreign Minister 
     and other governmental authorities, such as the Governor of 
     Benue, have undertaken an aggressive public affairs campaign 
     to deny and deflect the truth about their inaction to stop 
     the Fulani aggression against defenseless Christian farming 
     communities occurring in several Nigerian states. Bishop 
     Anagbe has even been personally threatened following his 
     testimony in Congress.
       We were alarmed to hear reports that between May 24-26, 
     2025, Fulani Muslim militants waged another massacre in Benue 
     state, possibly in reprisal for Bishop Anagbe&#x27;s speaking out 
     about Fulani violence in his testimony before Congress. This 
     recent attack was against the bishop&#x27;s home village of 
     Aondona, as well as its surrounding villages of Ahume, 
     Tyolaha, and Tse-Ubiam. Reuters reports that at least ``42 
     people were shot dead by suspected herders&#x27;&#x27; in those attacks 
     and that 32 of the villagers&#x27; bodies were recovered in 
     Aondona and Ahume, alone. In response, the U.S. Mission in 
     Abuja issued a statement on X strongly condemning these 
     brutal attacks and urging Nigerian authorities to investigate 
     and hold the responsible parties accountable. Other 
     governments also issued similar statements. Experience shows 
     that the Nigerian government has routinely failed to ensure 
     such investigations and accountability on what have become 
     relentless Fulani herder assaults on defenseless Christian 
     farming villages.
       Encouraged by the example of Bishop Wilfred Anagbe, others 
     are also speaking out against the government&#x27;s grant of 
     impunity in the face of such atrocities. This is a critical 
     time for Congress to act, as Nigerians in the Middle Belt 
     area are supporting international attention.
       Nigeria wields significant influence in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
     By allowing severe religious persecution to proliferate 
     within its borders, Nigeria is compounding already heightened 
     regional insecurity.
       We respectfully ask you to co-sponsor House Resolution 220 
     and urge the passage.
           Sincerely,

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, with his retirement as President of the 
Board of Directors of the Santa Barbara Mission Archive-Library on 
January 17th, 2025, John Gherini, Esq. concluded over thirty-seven 
years of distinguished service to the Archive-Library. Established as 
public non-profit educational corporation in 1967, the Santa Barbaran 
Mission Archive-Library serves as a unique repository of Mission

[[Page E730]]

Era California records, documents, and artifacts. As Professor Emeritus 
Robert Senkewicz of Santa Clara University, has written. ``SBMAL is a 
unique and indispensable resource. Its artifacts and documents tell the 
deep and complex story of California&#x27;s diverse peoples--especially 
Native Americans, Latinos, and Anglos--in a way that is unmatched 
anywhere else in the state.&#x27;&#x27;
  John Gherini has worked long and hard behind the scenes to ensure the 
continued operation of the Archive-Library. Serving as legal counsel to 
the Board and dealing with bequests and grants in order to build the 
endowment essential to its continued function. His membership on the 
Board, which began in 1987, has resulted in numerous acquisitions not 
only of funds, but also of the papers of such distinguished scholars as 
Norman Neuerburg, the art historian behind the construction of the 
Getty Villa, and Doyce B. Nunis, Jr., longtime editor of the journal of 
the Historical Society of Southern California.
  Besides his encouragement of other scholars, Mr. Gherini has written 
two books on the history of Santa Cruz Island, where he spent much time 
as a young man working with his family on the island, which his great-
great-grandfather, Justinian Caire once owned in its entirety: Santa 
Cruz Island: A History of Conflict and Diversity and the two volume 
Santa Cruz Island, An Illustrated History provide rich and detailed 
histories of the largest of the Channel Islands. The second work 
``explores the geological origins of the island and traces the cultural 
history from the native inhabitants, over 13,000 years ago, to the 
establishment of the Channel Islands National Park in 1980 and current 
efforts to preserve and protect the island.&#x27;&#x27; (Santa Barbara Historical 
Museum website). Mr. Gherini has been a generous benefactor and deeply 
involved with many other organizations in the Santa Barbara area, 
including Bishop Garcia Diego High School.
  On July 25, 2025, the Mission Archive-Library, at a special event in 
honor of Mr. Gherini, will name its exhibit space, which includes among 
other things large paintings by the distinguished turn of the 
twentieth-century California landscape and architecture artist Edwin 
Deakin, the Gherini Gallery. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Mr. John Gherini and the Santa Barbara Mission Archive-
Library on this auspicious occasion.

Sales and Marketing for Arrowhead Water.
  Richard was an incredible leader and an inspiration to many. I am 
grateful for his service to our country.
  Richard is survived by his children, grandchildren, and extended

man who cared deeply for everyone around him. Richard leaves behind a 
legacy defined by love and service.

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of an intern 
in my office, and a University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) 
student, Mr. Ian Kalvinskas, who recently passed away at the age of 20. 
He was a son, student, and friend.
  Kalvinskas was a Pasadena native and grew up with a love for soccer, 
travel, and politics. His parents owned a traveling bookstore, sparking 
Ian&#x27;s curiosity to explore the world&#x27;s geography. While in high school, 
Kalvinskas excelled scholastically, played on the school&#x27;s soccer team, 
and was awarded Most Valuable Player. After graduating from high school 
in 2023, he fulfilled his dream of attending UCLA to study Political 
Science.
  Driven by a deep passion for social justice, Kalvinskas aspired to 
advocate for underserved communities and one day work for the United 
Nations, using his education and experiences to make a global impact.
  Unfortunately, Kalvinskas was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2020, 
when he was 15 years old, and underwent liver transplantation at UCLA. 
For four and a half years, it appeared he had beaten cancer--but 
tragically, it recurred in November 2024.
  Despite battling the recurrence of his cancer, Kalvinskas achieved 
his dream of interning on Capitol Hill in the summer of 2025. He cared 
deeply about healthcare reform, and knowing his life expectancy was 
short, he wanted ``to make a difference now.&#x27;&#x27; His goal was to help 
write legislation that ensures pediatric patients receive fair 
consideration on the organ transplant waiting list. Though his life was 
cut short by cancer just a week later, his efforts laid the groundwork 
for lasting change.
  Kalvinskas passed away on June 27, surrounded by his loved ones, in a 
DC hospital--fittingly in the shadow of the Capitol--a symbol to him of 
how visions for change could become reality. He touched countless lives 
with his warmth, idealism, and humanity. He lived a courageous and 
meaningful life by dedicating his final days to advancing a cause he 
believed in--a goal that reflected the very core of his character. 
Kalvinskas was a true inspiration to all who had the privilege of 
knowing him.
  He is survived by his parents, Adrian and Susan Kalvinskas, along 
with his extended family. Our deepest condolences, thoughts, and 
prayers are with the Kalvinskas family during this difficult time.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating and 
honoring the life of a remarkable intern, student, and son, Mr. Ian 
Kalvinskas. His ambition and legacy will be remembered for many years 
to come. We join his family, friends, and community in celebrating a 
life lived with purpose, and in mourning a loss felt deeply by all who 
knew him.

           HONORING UAW LEADER BRUCE BAUMHOWER AS HE RETIRES

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARCY KAPTUR

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable, hard 
working, good natured man of labor: Bruce Baumhower from Toledo, Ohio 
in our 9th Congressional District. Mr. Baumhower formally retired on 
June 30, 2025 after serving as the President of United Auto Workers 
(UAW) Local 12, the longest run of service in the union&#x27;s history--over 
a half a century. He will be honored at a special event prior to 
Toledo&#x27;s 2025 Jeep Fest--a celebration he co-founded in 2016--on 
Saturday, August 2, 2025.
  Bruce Baumhower is a Toledo native who graduated from Whitmer High 
School in 1972. He started work at Jeep the same year. Throughout his 
employment at Jeep, Bruce involved himself in union activities, rising 
through the ranks after election to Steward, Bargaining Committee and 
Vice Chairman. In 1993 he was elected President of UAW Local 12, the 
second largest UAW local in the nation. He has been ably at the helm 
since. UAW Local 12, based in Toledo, represents approximately 16,000 
members at 47 worksites. His leadership is humble yet reliably strong 
and honorable, and always visionary.
  Throughout Bruce&#x27;s tenure as leader of UAW Local 12, he has steered 
the union--and the Toledo community--through crisis and calm. Most 
notably, he led the effort to establish the plants and supplier park 
that built the Wrangler and the Gladiator, two locations that have 
defined Toledo&#x27;s skyline and its workforce. He has been an integral 
part of redefining Jeep as Toledo&#x27;s identity and his integrity and work 
ethic symbolizes Toledo, Ohio--a city whose motto is: Laborare est 
Orare, ``To Work is to Pray.&#x27;&#x27;
  In addition to his duties as President of UAW Local 12, Bruce is 
president of the UAW&#x27;s Community Action Program, which coordinates 
political and community action for all seven Toledo area UAW locals. 
Mr. Baumhower currently also serves on the board of Imagination Station 
and the Regional Growth Partnership.
  As one of the founders of Toledo&#x27;s Jeep Fest, Bruce has further 
imprinted Jeep on Toledo. It is said that he and another member had a 
conversation about Jeep&#x27;s 75th anniversary. From that moment, Jeep Fest 
was born. Eight years later, it is a three day festival drawing 
thousands of people from all corners and highlighted by a parade of 
hundreds of iconic Jeeps. Currently Bruce serves on the Board of 
Directors of Jeep Fest and leads off the parade with union members, who 
are both actively working and retired, all proud of Jeep&#x27;s continuing 
and amazing success--America&#x27;s most popular vehicle. The parade 
celebrates and American success story led by union members who show 
great pride in their roles and led by an energetic President.
  The great UAW pioneer Walter Reuther noted, ``There is no greater 
calling than to serve your fellow men. There is no greater contribution 
than to help the weak. There is no greater satisfaction than to have 
done it well.&#x27;&#x27; Bruce Baumhower epitomizes these words. His noble 
spirit guides the Union and the City in which he has played such a 
pivotal role.
  Now as he formally retires, we, wish him well on his journey, knowing 
he will be spending his time with his wife Kim, three children and 
eight grandchildren, engaged in all they most enjoy. I thank Bruce for 
all he has given to our community and our Nation during a trying era 
for US automotive manufacturing. He makes us proud. May he enjoy a 
well-earned retirement. May God Bless him unselfishly and continually.

               OPPOSING H.R. 3633, S. 1582, and H.R. 1919

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3633, the 
Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. S. 1582, the Guiding and Establishing 
National Innovation in U.S. Stablecoins Act, and H.R. 1919, the Anti-
CBDC Surveillance State Act.
  While I am opposed to these three bills, I am not opposed to the 
concept of crypto itself.

[[Page E729]]

But I have concerns about how crypto is currently being regulated and 
the financial security of my constituents who invest or store their 
dollars in crypto. Rather than considering the three bills before us 
this week, Congress should consider legislation that puts guardrails in 
place to protect consumers, prevent fraud, and establish an effective 
regulatory framework for crypto. Instead, these H.R. 3633, S. 1582, and 
H.R. 1919 fall short of creating an effective regulatory framework, 
allow Big Tech and the Trump family to enrich themselves, and stifles 
innovation at the Federal Reserve.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you a bit about what these three bills 
would do. H.R. 3633, which Republicans are calling the CLARITY Act, 
would carve the crypto industry out from current securities laws and 
regulations. This would continue to expose consumers to harmful crypto 
practices. Additionally, the CLARITY Act would not only enable 
conflicts of interest from Trump and his family through meme coins like 
$TRUMP, but it would also send the message that Congress approves of 
the way President Trump is selling access to the White House. That is 
why I joined Congressman Vindman in sending a letter to the House 
Committees on Financial Services and Agriculture expressing our serious 
concern that the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts, including dangerous carveouts 
for the President and Vice President from conflict-of-interest rules.
  S. 1582, the GENIUS Act, is a bipartisan attempt at establishing a 
framework for stablecoins--a type of cryptocurrency primarily used for 
trading crypto assets, transacting in goods and services, insulating 
against local currency instability, and sending payments across 
borders. While S. 1582 is a step in the right direction, it fails to 
establish an effective federal framework to regulate stablecoins. The 
bill also opens up a path for Big Tech and other commercial businesses 
like Meta, Amazon, and Walmart to amass consolidated power over both 
commerce and banking services. Each of these corporations are exploring 
starting their own stablecoins.
  Finally, H.R. 1919, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, would 
immediately halt and prohibit the United States from exploring the 
potential benefits of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). This bill 
would stifle innovation at the Federal Reserve as they research and 
develop ways to meet the evolving money and payments landscape, keeping 
the U.S. behind the starting line as other countries race ahead and 
compete to develop and implement CBDCs. As much of our transactions 
have moved away from using the physical dollar through the increased 
use of credit cards, mobile wallets, and cryptocurrencies, the Federal 
Reserve has been researching ways to innovate the U.S. dollar. Congress 
should not stifle the ability of the Federal Reserve to meet the needs 
of our evolving digital age.
  Mr. Speaker, rather than putting forward three bills that fail to 
make consumers safer and stifle innovation, Congress should instead 
consider a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto that will 
promote the responsible development of these digital assets while 
protecting American consumers and investors. I urge my colleagues to 
reject H.R. 3633, S. 1582, and H.R. 1919.

profound and positive impact on our community. It will bring families 
and fans together, create new economic opportunities, and further 
solidify Colorado&#x27;s reputation as a premier destination for

professional sports. I also want to specifically commend the 
organization&#x27;s investment in a state-of-the-art performance center in 
Centennial, purpose-built for the unique needs of professional women 
athletes. This facility is a landmark achievement and a powerful 
statement about the value and importance of women&#x27;s sports. Most 
importantly, the players of Denver Summit FC will serve as powerful 
role models for our children, demonstrating the limitless possibilities 
that can be achieved through hard work, perseverance, and a commitment 
to excellence.
  I want to extend my sincerest congratulations and a warm welcome to 
the players, coaches, staff, and ownership of Denver Summit FC. We 
eagerly await the inaugural season and the excitement of cheering on 
our new home team. The entire state of Colorado stands with them, and 
we look forward to celebrating their success for many years to come.

    RECOGNIZING THE 2025 CLASS OF THE OHIO AGRICULTURAL HALL OF FAME

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JIM JORDAN

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 25, 2025

  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the Ohio Agricultural Council will mark the 
induction of its 2025 Hall of Fame class at a special ceremony to be 
held next Friday, August 1, during the Ohio State Fair. I am honored to 
commend to the House this year&#x27;s four inductees:
  John Linder of Edison in my congressional district served as 2020-
2021 President of the National Corn Growers Association. His leadership 
skills, integrity, and dedication to the promotion of agriculture led 
to his 2023 election as president of MAIZALL--The International Maize 
Alliance, which works to break down barriers to trade and innovation. 
He and his brother are the fifth-generation operators of Linder Farms 
in Morrow County, where he also co-owns a propane business. John is 
also famous statewide and nationally as a champion tractor puller.
  The late Bill Isler of Prospect in my congressional district was a 
third-generation farmer and pork producer in Marion County. His 
commitment to innovation in the field of herd health earned him 
international recognition. As owner/operator of Isler Genetics, he was 
among the first to implement specific pathogen-free herd standards. A 
recipient of the Ohio Pork Industry Excellence Award from the Ohio Pork 
Council. Bill joins his brothers, Dick Isler and the late Gene Isler, 
as a Hall of Fame member.
  The late Steven D. Maurer of Botkins in my congressional district was 
a long-time public servant both locally and statewide. For much of the 
1970s, he served as Mayor of Botkins, later representing the area in 
the Ohio Senate for one term. He held top roles at the Ohio Department 
of Natural Resources and led the Ohio Department of Agriculture for 
several years in the late 1980s. For 16 years, he worked as State 
Executive Director of the USDA&#x27;s Farm Service Agency. Steve traveled 
overseas extensively throughout his career to promote Ohio products and 
expand our state&#x27;s trade opportunities.
  A native of Carroll County, John H. Davis has dedicated his life to 
teaching others about the importance of agriculture. After several 
years in the classroom in Ashtabula County, he was tapped to oversee 
vocational agriculture education statewide. During his 20 years as 
Director of Ohio FFA Camp Muskingum, he expanded the camp into a year-
round education center reaching thousands of students. John is a former 
Carroll County Commissioner and a member of the Carroll County Farm 
Bureau Hall of Fame.
  Selection for the Hall of Fame is a high honor that has been accorded 
to only 257 Ohioans since 1966. Consideration for induction is given to 
those who have made outstanding contributions to agriculture, Ohio&#x27;s 
top industry.
  On behalf of the people of Ohio&#x27;s Fourth Congressional District, I am 
pleased to join in the accolades for these four remarkable inductees as 
they are recognized for their commitment to agriculture and their 
lifetime of service to others. I also thank the members of the Ohio 
Agricultural Council for their ongoing work to honor Ohio&#x27;s agriculture 
leaders.
