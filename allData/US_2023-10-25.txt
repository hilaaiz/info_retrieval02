     COMMEMORATING OCTOBER AS NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JERROLD NADLER

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate October as 
National Spina Bifida Awareness Month, to recognize the approximately 
166,000 Americans living with this condition, and to draw attention to 
the critical challenges we must address to ensure that each and every 
one of these individuals can achieve their full human potential and 
have the quality of life they deserve.
  According to the Spina Bifida Association of America, Spina Bifida is 
the most common permanently disabling birth defect compatible with 
life. Literally translated as ``split spine,&#x27;&#x27; Spina Bifida occurs when 
a baby&#x27;s neural tube fails to develop or close properly. Typically 
occurring within the first 28 days of pregnancy while the neural tube 
is forming, Spina Bifida often develops before a woman even knows she 
is pregnant.
  Children born with Spina Bifida typically undergo dozens of surgeries 
before they reach the age of 18. And during their lifetime, someone 
with Spina Bifida will face at least a $1 million in medical expenses, 
including multiple surgeries.
  Despite these challenges--and thanks to advances in research and 
medicine, along with policies supportive of children with this 
condition--nearly two-thirds of Americans currently living with Spina 
Bifida have made it to adulthood. And while these strides are certainly 
worth celebrating, people with Spina Bifida--particularly adults--
continue to face a crisis of care that could be largely prevented with 
the right resources and policies.
  While we have a coordinated system of care designed to treat children 
with Spina Bifida in the U.S., there is no equivalent for adults. The 
result is that adults face a ``care cliff&#x27;&#x27; and enter a very fractured 
medical system where they are unable to find physicians willing or even 
knowledgeable enough to provide treatment, as Spina Bifida is stil 
largely taught in medical schools as a pediatric condition and 
education has failed to keep pace with the rapid rise in the adult 
Spina Bifida population. Thousands of adults are left with few options 
other than to seek care in the emergency room or continue to see their 
pediatric care team until insurance will no longer cover their care 
because of their age. And to make matters worse, many of these adults 
rely on Medicaid as their insurance provider, so even if they have the 
means to travel to an adult specialist, if they are located in another 
state--as is often the case--their coverage is denied. Across the 
country, there are more than 100 pediatric clinics devoted to caring 
for children with Spina Bifida. There are only 20 whose focus is on 
adults.
  At the federal level, we could make dramatic improvements in the 
ability of adults with Spina Bifida to access quality care by 
increasing the funding of the CDC&#x27;s National Spina Bifida Program--the 
only federal program tasked with improving the care and outcomes for 
people living with Spina Bifida. In 2008, the Spina Bifida Program 
created a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry to collect the 
scientific data needed to evaluate existing medical services for Spina 
Bifida patients, and to provide clinicians, researchers, patients, and 
families, a window into what care models are effective and what 
treatments are not making a measurable difference. Building on this in 
2014, the Spina Bifida Program funded the development of a Spina Bifida 
Collaborative Care Network to identify and to disseminate best 
practices for the care of people with Spina Bifida at all ages. 
However, with only $7.5 million in annual funding, there are only 
11,000 patients in the national registry, limiting the ability of 
medical professionals to glean knowledge that would advance research in 
areas critical to improving quality of life. Even modest increases to 
this funding would make an enormous difference.
  Additionally, we should urge NIH to work collaboratively across their 
many divisions to better understand Spina Bifida. As Spina Bifida can 
affect every organ and every system in the human body, a collaborative 
effort undertaken by NIH could result in research that would lead to 
better care for both this generation and future generations of Spina 
Bifida patients. Moreover, the new designation of those with 
disabilities as a health disparity creates a new opportunity to harness 
federal resources for the Spina Bifida community by ensuring their 
representation in NIH research and thereby recognizing those with this 
complex condition in a new and critical light.
  We are so fortunate today that our country is benefiting from the 
talent and contributions of the first generation of adults living with 
Spina Bifida. Today, I honor and celebrate all of them, along with 
their care partners, and also remember those we have lost to this 
condition. I urge my colleagues to not only increase funding for the 
National Spina Bifida Program, but to work together so that these 
Americans receive the care and treatment all of us want for our 
families and loved ones.

    COMMEMORATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VAN RAALTE FARMHOUSE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BILL HUIZENGA

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate 
the 150th anniversary of the Van Raalte Farmhouse. The Van Raalte 
Farmhouse has been a staple of our West Michigan community for 
generations, and we thank the City of Holland for preserving not only 
this site but the legacy of the Van Raalte family.
  The farmland was purchased by the founder of Holland, Reverend 
Albertus Van Raalte, in 1847. The Reverend split the land between two 
of his children, Albertus and Benjamin, as a gift for their valiant 
service during the Civil War. Benjamin, a soldier in the Union Army who 
served in Michigan&#x27;s 25th Infantry, purchased his brother&#x27;s half of the 
land and constructed a beautiful neoclassical farmhouse on the property 
in the early 1870s. Benjamin cultivated the land for the remainder of 
his life, producing peaches and peony flowers. The farm became known as 
``The Maples&#x27;&#x27; due to the large sugar maples grown on the property.
  The farm stayed in the family for multiple generations until it was 
sold in the 1980s to the city of Holland, Michigan. Holland helped 
transform the farmhouse and its land into a beautiful park. In 1989, 
Van Raalte Farmhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic 
Places. Today, community members continue to enjoy hikes and picnics as 
well as cross-country skiing and sledding in the winter at the park.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in commemorating 150 years of history at 
the Van Raalte Farmhouse as the Van Raalte family&#x27;s story and the 
farmhouse&#x27;s beauty continue to inspire the people of Michigan&#x27;s Fourth 
District.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RICHARD HUDSON

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Cook Out on being named one of the top ten regional fast-food 
restaurants in the country according to USA Today&#x27;s Readers Choice 
2023.
  Cook Out opened in 1989 in Greensboro, North Carolina and has since 
spread nationwide, operating more than 300 locations across the 
Southern United States. However, Cook Out has remained true to its 
Carolina roots and is a regional staple, best known for its famous tray 
combos and delicious milkshakes.
  I have been a big fan of Cook Out since I was growing up in North 
Carolina. To this day, one of my favorite parts about going home after 
a long stint in Washington is being able to sit down and enjoy Cook Out 
with my family, friends, or staff.
  Cook Out is a cultural icon and an esteemed member of our community 
in North Carolina. Its economic and community impact on our state is 
astounding and I look forward to continuing to work with them to see 
what they will accomplish in the future.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Cook Out, its 
leaders, and employees on this momentous occasion and thanking them for 
all they do for our shared home of North Carolina.

                          ____________________

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mrs. Lori Dobratz 
on more than 37 years of service to our country.
  Lori&#x27;s career with the federal government began in February 1986 with 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C., where she 
worked as the Secretary to the Division Chief in the medical unit. In 
May 1995, Lori joined Capital District Contracting Center, which later 
became the Fort Belvoir Mission and Installation Contracting Command. 
Throughout her 28 years there, Lori has played a critical role as a 
Management Support Assistant.
  As part of the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Lori supported efforts 
to ensure Army readiness at all times. Her hard work and contributions 
in service to the U.S. Army have not

[[Page E1016]]

gone unnoticed--as evidenced by the four performance awards Lori has 
received over the last five years.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mrs. Lori 
Dobratz for her hard work, dedication, and service to our country, as 
well as in celebrating her career, accomplishments, and retirement.

                                 GARCIA

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and memory of Elvira ``Vera&#x27;&#x27; Tamargo Garcia, who passed away at the 
age of 88 on August 8, 2023. She was a lifelong Tampa native and 
devoted teacher who dedicated her life to civic service. Vera&#x27;s 
contributions and tireless dedication to the Tampa Bay community will 
forever be remembered.
  Vera embodied the true spirit of public service, exemplifying the 
values of compassion, dedication and mentorship. Throughout her 48-year 
career as a teacher at Broward, Ballast Point and Mendenhall elementary 
schools, she left a mark on hundreds of students she taught, their 
parents, and new teachers she mentored. Throughout her career, Vera 
taught in every elementary grade. Her passion was for early childhood 
education, and she played an important role in launching kindergarten 
instruction in Hillsborough County schools. Her talent and experience 
as an educator were evident in the numerous accomplishments she 
achieved. Vera&#x27;s recognitions included Florida&#x27;s Outstanding Young 
Educator in 1966 and was ranked fourth at the national level.
  She attended the University of Tampa for her bachelor&#x27;s degree and 
subsequently earned a master&#x27;s degree from the University of South 
Florida. In her classroom, Vera strived to teach her students the 
values of respect and friendship along with phonics and counting, and 
her selfless service is manifested in the good principles of my Tampa 
Bay neighbors. Her tenacious determination as an instructor to future 
generations shaped much of her perspective and identity, but her work 
as a caregiver extended beyond the classroom.
  Many knew Vera for her work advocating for Tampa&#x27;s Latino heritage, 
protecting and preserving the Centro Asturiano de Tampa&#x27;s original 
cemetery and its 121-year-old building. Vera took the role of president 
for the historic social club for immigrants and their descendants, 
making her the first woman to hold that position at the ``Centro.&#x27;&#x27; She 
and her husband, attorney William F. ``Willie&#x27;&#x27; Garcia, devoted their 
later years to the preservation of the ``Centro.&#x27;&#x27; Earlier in their 
lives, Vera and Willie were active in state and local politics, running 
campaigns, attending rallies and always supporting Democratic 
candidates at the local, state and federal levels. At home, they would 
adorn Christmas gifts with handmade themed ornaments that they would 
spend months creating. Their marriage was filled with love and support 
for each other, accompanied by humor that made their bond stronger.
  The eldest of three girls, Vera was born to Francisco ``Pancho&#x27;&#x27; and 
Honorina ``Nora&#x27;&#x27; Tamargo. She and her two sisters, Junis and Sandra, 
shared a room as children and their lives as adults. Her devotion to 
her family was shown in her commitment to spend Christmas together with 
her two sisters and cousin Mary Louise. Vera was beloved by her many 
nieces, nephews and cousins who could call or stop by her home to say 
hello, help with a chore, or take her to a family gathering.
  For her two sons, William and Joseph, Vera was that unshakable 
support who got them where they needed to pursue their interests from 
swim meets to Scouting camping trips. Her grandchildren called her 
``Bueli&#x27;&#x27;, and they will remember her love and the way she lit up just 
hearing their voices.
  Vera is survived by her sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren and 
many loved ones to whom I extend my deepest sympathies. She will be 
remembered not only for her many years of selfless service, but also 
for her genuine compassion and kindness.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my sincere condolences to Vera&#x27;s 
family and friends. She impacted the lives of countless members of the 
Tampa Bay community and her steadfast leadership and patient mentorship 
undeniably enhanced the lives of my neighbors. Tampa Bay is grateful 
for her contributions and the legacy she leaves.

      THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FEDERALLY-INSURED CREDIT UNIONS

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Whitney 
Anderson on her recent election to the Board of Directors of the 
National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU). Credit 
unions play a vital role in our nation&#x27;s banking ecosystem allowing 
more people to access capital, obtain mortgages, and receive other 
financial tools that are otherwise difficult to obtain. Additionally, 
I&#x27;ve seen firsthand in my district, how credit unions provided vital 
services during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that the smallest of 
businesses received the necessary aid to assist during such trying 
times.
  Whitney currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Elements 
Financial, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. She previously 
served as Chief Community Development Officer at Michigan State 
University Federal Credit Union, served as President of the Desk Drawer 
Fund, and President of Ever Green 3C. Additionally, Whitney has had 
significant community involvement on boards such as the African 
American Credit Union Coalition (AACUC) National Board, MLK Commission 
of Mid-Michigan, and United Way. Her

[[Page E1015]]

years of leading a broad range of teams, projects, and responsibilities 
provide a solid foundation and will add a unique perspective in her new 
role.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Whitney Anderson and 
wishing her the best of luck in her new role on the NAFCU Board of 
Directors. I look forward to working with her and NAFCU members to 
better serve our constituents across Indiana&#x27;s 7th Congressional 
District.

             INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GIFT SHOP TAX ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Gift Shop Tax 
Act, which would allow state and local governments to impose a sales 
tax at gift shops on federal property. These governments would be able 
to generate millions of dollars in new tax revenue.
  When the federal government engages in activity that is not 
inherently governmental, such as operating a gift shop, there is no 
reason to exempt customer purchases from a sales tax. The items sold at 
federal gift shops, such as jewelry, apparel, accessories, games and 
books, are subject to a sales tax if sold on private property. 
Customers are often unaware of the exemption from a sales tax at gift 
shops on federal property, so the introduction of a sales tax is 
unlikely to have a significant impact on gift shop sales. It would, 
however, create a valuable revenue stream for state and local 
governments. In addition, state and local governments often provide 
uncompensated services on federal property, such as fire service, and 
allowing them to impose a sales tax at gift shops on federal property 
would allow them to recoup some of these costs.
  This bill is of particular importance to the District of Columbia, 
which is home to a number of gift shops on federal property, such as at 
the Smithsonian Institution and the John F. Kennedy Center for the 
Performing Arts.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Mr. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the 
following message I shared on October 11 at a meeting of Jewish leaders 
with Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia at the offices of the United 
Jewish Federation of Tidewater in Virginia Beach.

       Thank you Governor Youngkin for your initiatives to fight 
     the precipitous rise of anti-Semitism in these United States 
     and around the world. Your very timely visit with us so 
     shortly after the October 7 terrorist Hamas vicious attacks 
     on Israel&#x27;s innocent civilians near the Gaza border is deeply 
     appreciated along with ordering the lowering of the flag 
     throughout the Commonwealth. We turn to our shared one God of 
     life&#x27;s blessings who always brings us together to be one 
     caring family, gratefully united and gloriously diverse, ever 
     harkening onto the divine commandments of loving-kindness.
       At this painfully trying time of excruciating anguish and 
     an over-whelming sense of violation by heartless enemies of 
     humanity and civilized society, evoking terrifying images of 
     the Holocaust deeply seared within us and to which I can 
     personally testify as son of Polish survivors who lost 
     hundreds of murdered relatives, and one who spent his early 
     childhood in Europe&#x27;s transit and DP Camps, later growing up 
     in Haifa, Israel and serving in the IDF in the 1960s.
       Just as we did not allow ultimate victory to Nazism rooted 
     in historical anti-Semitism, so we shall defeat, whatever the 
     cost, those who now shamefully delight in the barbaric 
     slaughter of Jewish babies and their shocked parents, mowing 
     down hundreds of youth celebrating peace at a music festival 
     along with rape and torture; dragging to cruel captivity the 
     young as well as frail Holocaust survivors who had found 
     refuge in the world&#x27;s only sovereign Jewish state and the 
     Middle-East&#x27;s only democracy. We shall never abandon our 
     beloved Israeli sisters and brothers heroically fighting for 
     the very survival of their ancestral homeland which they have 
     already honored with remarkable accomplishments benefiting 
     all humanity.
       We are uplifted and reassured at this fateful hour of 
     existential threat to Israel&#x27;s very well-being by the 
     incomparable Israeli-American alliance of shared values and 
     interests that, no doubt, makes a critical difference for the 
     defense of the entire free world. The Ford and Eisenhower 
     strike groups whose homeport is Hampton Roads are truly a 
     source of swelling pride. The recent historic strides toward 
     lasting Middle East peace with the major inclusion at last of 
     Saudi Arabia, likely pushed Iran and its proxies--the enemies 
     of peace who glorify death and dying while the West 
     sanctifies life and living--to this inhuman cowardice massive 
     assault on a holy Jewish day--50 years and a day since the 
     other traumatic surprise of the Yom Kippur War--with total 
     disregard for basic human norms.
       They will be held accountable. Perhaps it was also a failed 
     attempt of divergence from the Ukraine tragedy. Restoring 
     Israel&#x27;s damaged deterrence is a must priority. The internal 
     Israeli bitter divisions around misguided Judicial Reform 
     were perceived to reflect a weakened society, though Israel 
     unites in a national security emergency, but a heavy price is 
     nonetheless exacted by an enemy tragically neglecting and 
     sacrificing its own Palestinian people.
       Oh God sustain our sacred resolve to face evil and subdue 
     it with Shalom&#x27;s eternal blessings that we shall not 
     compromise over, of healing, hope and harmony. Rabbi Dr. 
     Israel Zoberman is founder and spiritual leader of Temple Lev 
     Tikvah in Virginia Beach.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RASHIDA TLAIB

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Covenant Community 
Care, a well-known and trusted healthcare provider, as they celebrate 
the grand opening of their newest health clinic on Joy Road in Detroit 
in the 12th Congressional District.
  Covenant Care grew from humble beginnings in southwest Detroit when a 
doctor and pastor joined forces to with the simple idea of providing 
free healthcare access to the uninsured. The doctor delivered on her 
promise to provide free healthcare to the uninsured and many more 
rallied behind the cause, creating Covenant Community Care in 2000. The 
need for more resources was evident, and Covenant Community Care has 
been steadfast in its mission to remove barriers to high quality 
healthcare services. Over the years, Covenant Community Care has 
leveraged partnerships with other medical service providers and now has 
several locations across metropolitan Detroit.
  I had the honor of securing House-appropriated Community Project 
Funding for Covenant Community Care in FY2023 to support the 
construction of their newest clinic to provide critical services to our 
community. Covenant has operated a small health clinic at 18917 Joy Rd 
in Detroit for nearly eight years that has limited their ability to 
expand services. This project will be impactful not only tripling the 
clinical footprint in the community but providing accessibility to 
essential care like primary medical, dental, and behavioral health 
services to the Cody-Rouge neighborhood and surrounding communities.
  I am always incredibly honored to serve as a partner for the Covenant 
Community Care team and appreciate the ongoing high level of care and 
compassion you provide to our communities across the district and 
region. We offer congratulations and wish them well on the opening of 
their new clinic.

  Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize former Coconut 
Creek City Official Mikkie Belvedere for her many years of public 
service.
  Born in Tel Aviv to German parents who fled Nazi persecution, Mikkie 
emigrated to the United States as a teenager. Elected to the Coconut 
Creek City Commission at 72, she has a long history of serving her 
community in Coconut Creek. Mikkie served three four-year terms, during 
which her fellow commissioners elected her Vice-Mayor and then Mayor of 
Coconut Creek.
  Her public service extends far beyond city government, becoming 
active in various local groups, from helping establish and grow the 
Coconut Creek Multicultural Circle to serving as President of the 
Wynmoor Democratic Club. She is also an active member of her synagogue 
congregation. In her retirement, Mikkie remains intent on staying 
positive and helping her community, encouraging everyone she meets to 
``Keep Smiling.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in recognizing former Coconut 
Creek City Official Mikkie Belvedere for her outstanding service to the 
people of Coconut Creek in Florida&#x27;s 23rd Congressional District.

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Conway C. 
Johnson as he celebrates his 10th Pastoral Anniversary at Sharon 
Baptist Church of New Brunswick, New Jersey. Pastor Johnson continues 
to provide outstanding spiritual leadership and fellowship to the 
greater New Brunswick community.
  Elected as pastor of Sharon Baptist Church on June 8, 2013, Pastor 
Johnson brought with him a wealth of experience when he began leading 
the congregation on August 4, 2013. Pastor Johnson entered the ministry 
at 18 and began his pastoral ministry at 28. Prior to his call to serve 
Sharon Baptist Church, Pastor Johnson led New Hope Baptist Church of 
Manitou Park for 10 years.

[[Page E1014]]

  Under his leadership, the membership of Sharon Baptist Church has 
grown immensely. He has encouraged his congregants to practice faith in 
action, serving the needs of people through several worship and 
outreach ministries.
  Pastor Johnson is married to his loving wife Nakia, and together they 
are blessed with five children. Supporting his spiritual and charitable 
journey, he holds a Master of Arts degree in Human Services from 
Lincoln University of Pennsylvania.
  Mr. Speaker, once again, please join me in celebrating the 10th 
Pastoral Anniversary of Pastor Conway C. Johnson. His leadership, 
service, and dedication to the church and community are truly deserving 
of this body&#x27;s recognition.

                                 ______

                      Wednesday, October 25, 2023

  Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Spina 
Bifida and Hydrocephalus Day, as well as October as National Spina 
Bifida Month.
  Spina Bifida impacts families across these United States, my own 
included. My sister and niece have lived with Spina Bifida since 
childhood.
  Spina Bifida is a birth defect which results from a hole in the 
spiral cord that fails to close properly, which allows nerves and fluid 
to form a sac outside the body. This defect means that a child must 
undergo dozens of surgeries before adulthood, and even then, they face 
a multitude of mental and physical health issues. Each condition is 
unique, and no two children will be affected the same way.
  In a testament to the innovation and research of our American 
scientific ingenuity, we now have the first generation of adults who 
are living with Spina Bifida. However, there is still much work to do.
  It is our obligation to ensure proper funding for Spina Bifida care 
and research so that treatment and quality of life can improve for all 
Americans with this condition.

  Mr. VINCENTE GONZALES of Texas. Mr. Speaker, due to a family matter, 
I was not present to vote on Roll Call No. 528. Had I been present, I 
would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 528. I stand firm in my support 
for our ally, Israel, and the Jewish community amidst the ongoing 
conflict. I condemn the atrocities committed by Hamas and other 
terrorists and support additional appropriations so that Israel may 
defend itself.
