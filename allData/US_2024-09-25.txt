               CELEBRATING RIDGWAY, PA BICENTENNIAL YEAR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. GLENN THOMPSON

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
Ridgway, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Bicentennial year.
  In 1817, Philadelphian shipping merchant Jacob Ridgway purchased 
120,000 acres of land in Northwest Pennsylvania.
  Forty thousand of these acres would officially become Elk County on 
April 18, 1843 with Ridgway as the county seat.
  According to historians, the town of Ridgway was established in 1824 
when one of Mr. Ridgway&#x27;s nephews, James Gillis, convinced Ridgway that 
his land, which was filled with an abundance of lumber, could become a 
lucrative business opportunity.
  In the past two hundred years, Ridgway has evolved into a thriving 
community where the lumber industry continues to flourish.
  Ridgway is home to the Ridgway Chainsaw Carving Rendezvous.
  What began as a shared passion of family and friends enthusiastic 
about wood carving has grown into the largest chainsaw carving 
gathering of its kind, attracting visitors from across the globe.
  Mr. Speaker, Ridgway, PA, is home to a vibrant community, and I hope 
you will join me in wishing Ridgway a happy 200th-year celebration.

                          ____________________

                      HON. NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable 
and continued leadership and service of Mr. Scott Bieler.
  As the President and CEO of West Herr, Scott leads the largest 
privately-owned automotive group in New York State, and one of the 
biggest in the United States. All told, there are over 3,000 employees 
across 39 locations in Erie, Niagara, Monroe, and Ontario counties, 
with new expansions and locations always on the horizon.
  Scott has continued to go above and beyond, and while he is known as 
generous--few know the extent of his philanthropy throughout the 
community. Scott is actively involved and supports many charitable and 
community initiatives, including the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation, 
Visit Buffalo Niagara, and Daemen University.
  On Thursday, September 26th, Mr. Scott Bieler will be honored at 
Buffalo Niagara Partnership&#x27;s Second Annual Economic Development 
Summit, where he will receive the 2024 Industry Leader Award. On behalf 
of Western New York, I am proud to congratulate my friend on his many 
accomplishments, and I join him in celebrating this well-deserved 
award.
  I therefore ask that this legislative body now join me in celebrating 
Mr. Bieler&#x27;s accomplishments, along with his continued dedication to 
leadership and community service.

CONGRATULATING CITY OF HOPE ON BEING NAMED A TOP 5 HOSPITAL FOR CANCER 
                                  CARE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate City of Hope&#x27;s National 
Medical Center in Duarte, California on being recognized as one of the 
nation&#x27;s top 5 hospitals for cancer care by the U.S. News &amp; World 
Report&#x27;s 2024-2025 rankings. In the same report, the center was also 
rated as high performing in six cancer procedures: lung cancer surgery, 
colon cancer surgery, prostate cancer surgery, gynecologic cancer 
surgery, gastroenterology and GI cancer surgery, and in the treatment 
of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma.
  City of Hope is the only freestanding National Cancer Institute-
designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in California that is not 
affiliated with a university. Their system in California includes the 
Duarte campus, a new cancer center in Orange County, and clinical 
locations across Southern California, along with cancer treatment 
centers and outpatient facilities in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Phoenix 
areas. City of Hope continues to be a national leader and innovator in 
a range of complex cancer types and innovative technologies, and 
because of them, hundreds of thousands of lives continue to be saved 
through these advances.
  I know firsthand of the dedication and devotion that City of Hope is 
committed to offering all who are in need, particularly to those from 
traditionally underserved communities. It has been a trusted 
institution in Southern California, offering superior care to the 
community for many decades.
  I congratulate City of Hope and all its staff on this well-deserved 
national recognition by U.S. World News &amp; Reports, and I wish them 
continued success.

    CONGRATULATING MAJOR GENERAL KENNETH S. HARA ON HIS SERVICE AND 
                               RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JILL N. TOKUDA

                               of hawaii

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Major General 
Kenneth S. Hara, the Adjutant General of the State of Hawaii, on his 
retirement from the Hawaii National Guard after a celebrated 40 years 
of service to our state and our nation.
  As Hawaii&#x27;s adjutant general, Major General Hara serves as commander 
of the Hawaii National Guard and the director of the Hawaii Emergency 
Management Agency. In those roles, he has led the state&#x27;s response to 
some of the most challenging and complex emergencies in Hawaii&#x27;s 
history. In March 2020, just a few months after Major General Hara 
became the adjutant general, Governor Josh Green asked him to serve as 
the state&#x27;s incident commander for the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to his 
leadership, Hawaii&#x27;s response to the pandemic was among the most 
successful in the country.
  Over the course of his career, Major General Hara also served as the 
dual status commander of Joint Task Force-50 in response to the Kilauea 
eruption and Hurricane Lane in 2018 and as commander of Task Force KOA 
after the 2006 Hawaii Island earthquake. And as a First Lieutenant over 
thirty years ago, he played a key role in supporting the state&#x27;s 
response to Hurricane Iniki in 1992.
  But what I will most remember Major General Hara for is his role in 
leading the state&#x27;s response to the August 2023 wildfires on Maui and 
supporting their recovery. As the freshman representative for Hawaii&#x27;s 
Second Congressional District that spans all eight of our islands, I am 
grateful to Major General Hara for his work in coordinating the state&#x27;s 
response to this unprecedented disaster in our state&#x27;s history 
alongside our local and federal partners.
  Throughout his career in the National Guard, Major General Hara 
deployed three times. In 2005, he deployed to Baghdad, Iraq in support 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom as commander of the 299th Infantry&#x27;s 2nd 
Battalion. In 2008, he deployed to Kuwait as deputy commander of the 
29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Then, in 2012, this time as 
commander of the 29th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, he deployed to 
Kandahar in Afghanistan.
  His many awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense 
Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star with one 
Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, the Meritorious Service Medal with three 
Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters, the Army Aviator Badge, and the Combat 
Infantryman Badge.
  Major General Hara&#x27;s career continued a legacy of service that began 
with his late father, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Hara. Alongside his 
three brothers, Major General Hara has ensured that the Hara name is 
synonymous with service to our state and the nation.
  This career dedicated to service has also been a family commitment, 
and I would be remiss if I did not also thank Major General Hara&#x27;s wife 
Myoung and his children Kristin, Julia, Nichole, Justin, and Alicia. 
Their support and sacrifice made his success possible for all of us.
  As he and his entire family transition to a new chapter, I proudly 
join them in celebrating a tremendous career that will continue to 
inspire and motivate future generations of leaders. But even more 
importantly, I wish them all the best in enjoying a well-earned 
retirement.
  Mahalo to Ken for all that he has done and given to Hawaii and our 
country.

and supervisors for the outstanding work they do every day. It is my 
honor to play a small role in recognizing their efforts as a token of 
appreciation for the difficult and often thankless task of keeping our 
communities safe. I will always support these men and women in blue, 
and I look forward to welcoming each of these hometown heroes to a 
ceremony in October to formally recognize them in-person. In 
recognition of their bravery and commitment, I would like to include in 
the Record the names of these twenty-two Hometown Heroes:
  Officer Alyse Brown, Sparta Township Police Department, Staff

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Tom Raffio on 
receiving the Walter R. Peterson Award for Education and Public 
Service. The Walter R. Peterson Award for Education and Public Service 
is presented to an individual whose contributions best exemplify the 
late governor&#x27;s values of public service and dedication to higher 
education.
  As a passionate civic leader, Tom&#x27;s community leadership spans across 
numerous New Hampshire organizations that support local education 
initiatives, youth programs, health causes, and the arts. Tom believes 
in the importance of access and affordability to quality post-secondary 
education for all New Hampshire residents.
  Under Tom&#x27;s leadership, the Northeast Delta Dental Foundation is 
committed to improving oral health care accessibility and education. 
This Foundation supports oral health programs each year throughout New 
Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine. It also addresses the shortage of 
dentists in under-served communities by raising funding for medicine 
scholarships and dental education loan repayment programs. In New 
Hampshire, one of the dental health education programs serves adult 
clients with disabilities, many of whom encounter oral health 
challenges. Further expanding its community impact under Tom&#x27;s 
leadership, it has grown to include numerous local community partners 
to join this philanthropic mission.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I want to extend my gratitude to Tom Raffio for his 
exceptional commitment to serving New Hampshire. We thank Tom for his 
leadership and contributions to advance health equity and the overall 
wellness of our local communities. His work has enriched so many lives 
and is an inspiration for us all to join together and improve the lives 
of our community members.

  INTRODUCTION OF THE SAN PABLO NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE EXPANSION ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the ``San Pablo Bay 
National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act.&#x27;&#x27; I thank U.S. Senator Alex 
Padilla (D-CA) for sponsoring the companion legislation and my 
colleagues, Congressmen Jared Huffman (D-CA) and Mike Thompson (D-CA) 
for cosponsoring my bill.
  The San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge is one of California&#x27;s 
treasured places, protecting more than 24,390 acres of tidal marshes 
and wetlands in the north San Francisco Bay Area. As part of the 
Pacific Flyway, the National Wildlife Refuge provides critical habitat 
for endangered species and migratory birds.
  The ``San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act&#x27;&#x27; would 
add approximately 5,658 acres of adjacent baylands owned by the State 
of California and the nonprofit Sonoma Land Trust to the National 
Wildlife Refuge&#x27;s boundary. This expansion would increase the National 
Wildlife Refuge&#x27;s acreage by more than 23 percent, supporting President 
Biden&#x27;s ``America the Beautiful&#x27;&#x27; National Conservation Goal to protect 
and conserve at least 30 percent of the lands and waters in the United 
States by 2030 and Governor Newsom&#x27;s similar conservation goal for the 
State of California.
  Conserving California&#x27;s special places has been a lifelong passion 
throughout my tenure in the State Legislature, as Deputy Secretary of 
the Interior to President Clinton, and now as a Member of Congress 
representing Solano County. San Pablo Bay is one of those special 
places. This bill will help to restore the saltmarshes in San Pablo Bay 
for future generations and increase outdoor recreation opportunities 
for Bay Area residents and visitors alike.
  Importantly, this bill does not infringe upon state interests or 
individual property owners and prevents the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service from using eminent domain to acquire properties within the 
expanded boundaries. Instead, the bill directs the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service to only acquire land within the newly extended 
boundary from willing sale or donation. Furthermore, the bill 
encourages the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to engage in cooperative 
management with state agencies to better manage the National Wildlife 
Refuge and nearby state conservation lands within the San Pablo Bay 
watershed.
  This bill is inspired by the tireless efforts of the late U.S. 
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and the late Congressman Don Edwards 
(D-CA) to restore and conserve the Bay Area&#x27;s saltmarshes and wetlands. 
Thanks to their leadership and steadfast work, the Don Edwards San 
Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in the South Bay now encompasses 
over 30,000 acres of habitat for millions of migratory birds and 
endangered species. It is an honor to continue Senator Feinstein and 
Congressman Edwards&#x27; legacy of protecting and restoring resilient 
bayland ecosystems that benefit both wildlife, people, and our planet.
  The ``San Pablo National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act&#x27;&#x27; takes a 
critical step toward preserving the Bay Area&#x27;s ecological diversity and 
ensuring the resilience of our communities as we continue fighting the 
climate crisis. I thank the hundreds of Bay Area residents and 
Californians who participated in the public comment period on my draft 
bill announced in September 2023. Their thoughtful comments and 
overwhelming support made this a stronger bill.
  My colleagues and I are honored to introduce this bill to help 
restore vital ecosystems and improve the north Bay&#x27;s climate resiliency 
by preserving one of California&#x27;s special places for future 
generations. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to join us in 
cosponsoring this bill.

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chandra 
Cheeseborough, who was named a 2024 She Leads Woman of Distinction.
  Chandra Cheeseborough is an example of a world record breaking 
Olympic Champion with a successful coaching career after receiving one 
of the first ever Title IX scholarships given to deserving female 
athletes.
  Chandra broke onto the international track scene at age 16, winning 
two gold medals at the 1975 Pan American Games, taking the 200 meters 
in an American record time of 22.77 seconds. In 1976, she set the World 
junior record at 11.13 seconds, placing second at the U.S. Olympic 
trials, then placing sixth in that event at the Montreal Olympic games.
  Chandra graduated from Jean Ribault High School in Jacksonville, 
Florida in 1977, where she set the still standing NFHS national high 
school records in both the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes. She attended 
Tennessee State, where she was a member of national championship teams 
that set world indoor records. She qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic 
team but was unable to compete due to the Summer Olympics boycott. She 
won the national indoor 200-yard dash in 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1983.
  Chandra&#x27;s breakthrough year in the 400-meter race came in 1984, when 
she set two American records in the event, then placing second in the 
Los Angeles Olympics in a career best of 49.05, the No. 10 performer of 
all time. She made history at the 1984 games when she became the first 
woman to win gold medals in both relays, which were held less than an 
hour apart.
  In 1999 she was named head coach of both men and women&#x27;s track and 
cross-country teams leading her Tigerbells to 6 Ohio Valley Conference 
Championships. She also served as assistant coach for the 2008 Beijing 
Olympics hurdles and sprints.
  Her faith in Christ has been a beacon of hope and strength to her 
student athletes.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this 
inspiring woman of distinction.

                     Wednesday, September 25, 2024

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor retired USAF 
Lieutenant Colonel Harold Eugene Rafuse, of Crawford, Texas, by 
presenting him with a Congressional Veteran Commendation. His 
persistent efforts in fostering beliefs of sacrifice and respect 
reflect his value as a leader during service and in retirement.
  Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse devoted nearly 20 years to active duty in 
the United States Air Force serving with distinction in a variety of 
critical roles. As an airborne Forward Air Controller and close air 
support combat fighter pilot, he flew the North American T-28D Trojan 
aircraft in Southeast Asia as a Raven Pilot, providing vital support to 
ground forces. He also piloted the RC-135 aircraft, conducting high-
altitude photographic and electronic reconnaissance missions in Eastern 
and Southeast Asia, significantly contributing to our national security 
efforts.
  Later in his career, he was selected for the newly established United 
States Air Force Space Operations Command, where he served as a space 
operations and surveillance commander. His leadership in this emerging 
field showcased his adaptability and commitment to advancing our 
Nation&#x27;s capabilities in space.
  Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse&#x27;s 20 years of active service are 
complemented by his extensive experience in aviation, aerospace, 
scientific research, engineering, technology, education, senior program 
management, information resource management, and administration. He 
held influential positions across the Department of Defense, multiple 
federal intelligence agencies, and various civilian educational and 
business institutions. Notably, he served as a science and technology 
advisor to the Office of President Ronald Reagan, a testament to his 
expertise and the trust placed in him at the highest levels of 
government.
  By the time of his retirement, his exceptional achievements had 
earned him numerous titles and certifications, including Senior Pilot 
in the Air Force, Senior Space Operations Commander, Space Surveillance 
and Mission Assessment Expert, Command Missileer, Master Acquisition 
Manager (Department of Defense Level III certified), and Master 
Instructor.
  Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse&#x27;s decorations include the Meritorious 
Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Force Commendation 
Medal, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force 
Organizational Excellence Award with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the 
National Defense Service Medal, the Air Force

[[Page E980]]

Longevity Service Ribbon with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Small Arms 
Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (Pistol), and the Air Force Training Ribbon. 
These honors reflect his dedication, skill, and the high esteem in 
which he is held by his peers and superiors.
  Following his distinguished military career, Lieutenant Colonel 
Rafuse has been deeply involved in community service and education. He 
co-founded the Baylor University School of Engineering and Computer 
Science and has served on its Board of Advocates for over 25 years, 
influencing the education of countless students. He has also been a 
member of the Baylor University Air Institute&#x27;s Board of Advisors for 
over five years, contributing his expertise to the advancement of 
aviation education.
  Currently, he chairs the Board of Texas State Technical College, 
where he has served for over 25 years, demonstrating his long-term 
commitment to technical education and workforce development. 
Additionally, he is a member and former president of the Heart of Texas 
Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America, where he has 
served on the educational scholarship selection committee for over 25 
years, supporting the next generation of leaders. These are just a few 
examples of the many organizations where Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse has 
made significant contributions as a member and leader.
  It is with great honor and respect that I present retired USAF 
Lieutenant Colonel Harold Eugene Rafuse with a Congressional Veteran 
Commendation from the 17th Congressional District of Texas. His 
exemplary service to our Nation and continued contributions to his 
community stand as an inspiration to us all.
