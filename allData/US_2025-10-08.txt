today I rise to congratulate Dr. Steven 
Ashby on his retirement as Director of the Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory in Richland, Washington.
  Since 2015, Dr. Ashbys leadership at PNNL has driven scientific 
excellence and innovation, advancing the lab as a world leader in 
science, national security, and energy research and development.
. Having spent over a decade working to 
expand the labs reach with new partnerships and opportunities, he 
transformed PNNL from a research lab to a world-class institution held 
in the highest regards throughout the scientific community.
  I also commemorate Dr. Ashby for his work on modernizing PNNL and 
equipping the lab for the future. Under his leadership, the campus 
became a hub for new and emerging technologies, including the Energy 
Sciences Center and the Grid Storage Launchpad, that will contribute to 
research and innovation for decades to come.
, I thank Dr. Ashby for his willingness to work with 
myself and members of the Washington Congressional Delegation. We built 
a strong relationship over the years and worked diligently to ensure 
PNNL had the resources needed to not only be successful but excel in 
their mission.
  I wish Dr. Ashby the very best in his retirement and thank him for 
his years of service.
EXPRESSING GRATITUDE TO THE CITY OF BROWNSVILLES ENGINEERING AND 
                                of texas
I rise today to recognize 
the City of Brownsvilles Engineering and Public Works Department for 
their exemplary service following the severe storms that struck Cameron 
County and devastated neighborhoods in Harlingen and surrounding areas 
last spring.
  In March of this year, our region received more than 20 inches of 
heavy rainfall, which caused widespread flooding, damaged 
infrastructure, and left countless families in need of urgent support.
  During this crisis, the Brownsville Engineering and Public Works 
Department deployed staff, equipment, and expertise to assist flood-
impacted communities. Their crews worked tirelessly, operating pumps, 
heavy machinery, and other resources to help remove water from our 
streets and restore accessibility for residents. Their work provided 
not only critical relief, but also a sense of hope to our neighbors in 
Harlingen.
  This effort was not theirs alone. The Brownsville Police Department 
served more than 600 hot meals to affected families at

Laureles County Park. Meanwhile the Brownsville Fire Department stood 
alongside residents to safeguard their health and safety. Together, 
these coordinated actions reflect the best of who we are in South 
Texas--neighbors helping neighbors, united through compassion and 
service.
, on behalf of South Texas, I wish to extend my deepest 
gratitude to the Brownsville Engineering and Public Works Department, 
along with all the city staff who answered the call to serve. Their 
dedication and solidarity in times of hardship embody the very spirit 
of community that makes the Rio Grande Valley strong.
I rise today to recognize Brooke L. 
Rollins as a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman of 
Distinction award recipient.
  Brooke L. Rollins is the 33rd U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and only

of the America First Policy Institute (AFPI). During President Trumps

policy director and later as CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, 
transforming it into a nationally recognized think tank.
  Guided by her deep Christian faith, Rollins views her work in public 
policy as a calling to serve people, strengthen families, and uphold 
biblical values. She is being honored as a 2025 She Leads America 
Christian Woman of Distinction.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this 
outstanding woman of distinction.
I rise today to recognize CeCe Heil as a 
2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman of Distinction award 
recipient.
  CeCe Heil is Senior Counsel and International Legal Director at the 
American Center for Law and Justice, specializing in public policy and 
global legal matters, including the

of life, defense of Christians, protection of U.S. national security 
interests, defense of Israel, and confronting Islamic extremism. She

from Turkey and Pastor Nerren from India.
  Heil is a recognized leader in advancing pro-family, pro-life, and 
pro-free enterprise policies, including being a former candidate for 
U.S. Congress. Her service and expertise as a constitutional law 
scholar earned her the support of Sarah Palin, who named her one of a 
handful of ``Mama Grizzlies. In recognition of her leadership and 
faith, she is being honored as a 2025 She Leads America Christian Woman 
of Distinction.
  Guided by her deep faith in Jesus Christ, Heil views her legal work 
as more than a profession--it is a calling. Prayer and biblical values

justice on behalf of the vulnerable.

Tennessee, Virginia, and Missouri, as well as being licensed to 
practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this 
outstanding woman of distinction.
I rise today to recognize Kayleigh Bush as 
a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman of Distinction award 
recipient.
  In 2025, Kayleigh Bush competed and won the Miss America preliminary 
title of Miss North Florida. Just four weeks after being crowned, she 
faced a decision that tested her faith, her courage, and her 
convictions. Pageant directors presented a newly revised contract that 
redefined what it means to be female. Choosing truth over a title, 
Kayleigh courageously declined to sign.
  Following the Matthew 18 model, she privately pleaded with the 
organizations leaders, urging them to return to truth and biological 
reality. Her appeal was met with indifference, but Kayleigh remained 
steadfast, accepting the loss of her title rather than compromising her 
faith.
  Kayleigh represents a modern-day Esther: one who is willing to speak 
when the culture demands silence. Her story reminds us that courage is 
contagious, truth is not negotiable, and that no earthly crown compares 
to the one given by Christ.
  Her boldness has been recognized nationally. In 2025, She Leads 
America is honoring Kayleigh with a Young Christian Woman of 
Distinction award, celebrating her as a rising leader who demonstrates 
unwavering faith, integrity, and moral clarity. This recognition places 
her among a network of accomplished Christian women leaders who are 
shaping culture with courage and conviction.
  Today, we honor Kayleigh Bush--not just as the Canceled Crown, but as 
a living testimony of 1 Timothy 4:12: ``Let no one look down on you 
because of your youth, but be an example for the believers in speech, 
in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this 
outstanding woman of distinction. This outstanding woman of 
distinction.
I rise today to honor and recognize a truly 
remarkable leader and dedicated public servant, Major General Laura M. 
Clellan, on the occasion of her retirement as The Adjutant General of 
Colorado. For over three decades, Major General Clellan has served our 
Nation and the State of Colorado with unwavering commitment, integrity, 
and distinction.
  Major General Clellans exceptional career began in 1989 when she was 
commissioned as a Second Lieutenant through the Army ROTC program. Her 
journey has been one of exemplary leadership and selfless service, 
marked by numerous key assignments and deployments that have taken her 
across the globe in defense of our freedoms. She has answered the call 
of duty in Afghanistan, Hungary, Panama, Saudi Arabia, and Honduras, 
leading our troops with courage and compassion.
  Her command of the 193rd Military Police Battalion during Operation 
Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan stands as a testament to her leadership 
under the most demanding of circumstances. She has consistently 
demonstrated a profound dedication to the well-being and readiness of 
our Soldiers and Airmen.
  In her most recent role as the 44th Adjutant General of Colorado, 
Major General Clellan made history as the first woman to hold the 
position. She has been a transformative leader for the Colorado 
National Guard. Assuming command in 2020, she expertly guided the 
organization through a period of unprecedented challenges, including 
the states response to the COVID-19 pandemic, devastating wildfires, 
and floods. Her steady hand ensured the safety and security of our 
communities while fostering a climate of excellence and inclusivity. As 
Executive Director of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, 
her strategic vision enhanced not only the readiness of our forces but 
also the support for our states veterans.
, Major General Clellans career is a shining example of a 
life dedicated to service. Her leadership has left an indelible mark on 
the Colorado National Guard and our Nation. On behalf of a grateful 
state and Nation, I extend my deepest gratitude to Major General Laura 
M. Clellan for her more than 35 years of distinguished service.
HONORING TERRI ``WINDTALKER CLAH AS A 2025 SHE LEADS AMERICA 
                     CHRISTIAN WOMAN OF DISTINCTION
I rise today to recognize Terri 
``WindTalker Clah as a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman 
of Distinction award.
  Terri ``WindTalker Clah of the Dine (People of the Land) Nation and 
Ute Mountain Ute Tribe was raised in the Four Corners region on her 
ancestral lands, immersed in the beauty, resilience, and painful 
history of her people. Listening to the elders stories from a young 
age--some filled with hope, others scarred by struggle--shaped her deep 
understanding of cultural identity, spiritual strength, and the need 
for healing across generations.
  Leadership is woven into Terris heritage. Her great-uncle, Deshna 
Clah, served as the second Chairman of the Dine Nation, while her 
uncle, Peter McDonald, was both a President of the Dine Nation and is 
one of the last living U.S. Marine Code Talkers. Inspired by her 
mother, Bessie Clah, who modeled a life of service, Terri embraced her 
own path of advocacy and reconciliation.
  At age 26, she encountered Jesus Christ, whose message of love and 
restoration affirmed her Native identity and calling to bridge 
cultures. Through her Moccasins Across America Prayer Walk--from 
California to Washington, DC, May through October 2025--Terri has 
ignited a national movement for prayer, justice, and healing. Today, as 
a She Leads America Christian Woman of Distinction, she continues to 
inspire others to walk in faith and carry the love of God to the 
Nation.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this 
outstanding woman of distinction.
I rise today to honor the 
60th anniversary of the Diocese of Brownsville, a community of faith 
that has for decades served as a spiritual home and source of strength 
for the people of the Rio Grande Valley.
  Since its founding in 1965, the Diocese of Brownsville has grown into 
one of the most vibrant Catholic dioceses in the nation. Through its 
parishes, schools, and ministries, the Diocese has nurtured the faith 
of its members and provided essential services to countless families 
across South Texas.
  The Diocese has long been a committed voice for justice and 
compassion in our region. Its leaders and parishioners have worked 
tirelessly to support immigrant communities, provide disaster relief, 
and advocate for the dignity of all people. This commitment reflects 
not only the teachings of faith, but also the values of service and 
solidarity that define the Rio Grande Valley
  As the Diocese marks its 60th anniversary, it does so with a proud 
legacy of compassion, inclusivity, and unwavering dedication to the 
people of South Texas. Its clergy, religious, and lay leaders have 
carried forward a mission rooted in faith and community, inspiring 
generations to service others and live lives of devotion.
, on behalf of a grateful South Texas, I congratulate the 
Diocese of Brownsville and all those who have contributed to its 
mission over the past six decades. May the Diocese continue to serve, 
inspire, and strengthen our communities for many years to come.
it is a heavy heart that I rise 
to recognize the extraordinary life of David Schaecter. President of 
the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA, who passed away on September 4, 
2025, at the age of 96.
  David was born in a small town in Slovakia in 1929. At age 11, after 
witnessing the murder of his father, he and his family were rounded up 
by the Nazis and sent to the Auschwitz death camp. He survived the hell 
of Auschwitz, and even a transfer to Buchenwald. But the entire rest of 
his family; his

mother, father, sisters, brother, aunts, uncles and cousins were all 
brutally killed in the Holocaust--105 family members in total. After 
the war, as a lone survivor, David fled to Prague and eventually came 
to America in 1950. He learned English in only nine weeks and graduated 
from UCLA with a degree in industrial engineering.
  David was a shining spiritual light even though he experienced such 
horror and despair. He spent his life sharing his story with others 
with the hope that it would end the scourges of antisemitism, hate, and 
violence. He became a national spokesperson on behalf of survivors, 
visited schools in 18 states to educate our young people, and remained 
active and engaged until very recently, having testified before the 
U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging on the subject Never Again: 
Addressing the Rise of Antisemitism and Supporting Older Americans.
  At home, David co-founded the Holocaust Memorial in Miami Beach that 
has served as a cornerstone for Holocaust education for South 
Floridians and visitors from around the world. This lion in our midst 
was a relentless and powerful advocate for the Holocaust survivor 
community and a true Zionist, a supporter of the state of Israel as the 
rightful homeland of the Jewish people. He was an icon who used his 
experiences to teach us all about the perils of antisemitism, so the 
words ``Never Again have meaning.
  His work on behalf of survivors was inspiring, and I was proud to 
call him my friend. My heart is with Davids wife Sydney, his children, 
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. May his memory be for a 
blessing.
I rise today to recognize 
and honor the outstanding service of the Brownsville Police Department 
during the historic flooding that struck South Texas earlier this year.
  In just two days, our community in South Texas was hit with nearly a 
years worth of rainfall. The city of Harlingen was hit especially 
hard, receiving over twenty inches of rain, which left vehicles 
stranded, streets flooded, and many residents without power or access 
to food.
  In response to this natural disaster, the Brownsville Police 
Department answered the call for help. Partnering with The Salvation 
Army, they served over 600 hot meals to families in need. Their swift 
action and compassion provided critical relief to families struggling 
in the aftermath of the storm. Mr. Speaker, this cross-city partnership 
is a powerful reminder of our regions resilience and commitment to 
service. When disaster struck, the Brownsville Police Department 
stepped up when our community needed them the most, exemplifying the 
highest standards of service and solidarity.
, on behalf of a grateful South Texas, I am proud to honor 
the brave men and women of the Brownsville Police Department for their 
exemplary heroism during a devastating flood.
I rise today not only as a 
Member of Congress, but as a geriatric nurse practitioner and an 
advocate for our nurses across the Nation, to recognize the unyielding 
composure of our emergency nurses during Emergency Nurses Week.
  In the United States, it is federal law that an emergency room never 
closes and that every person who comes to an ER receives care. Day or 
night, emergency nurses answer the call of duty--providing quality care 
to patients in critical condition while operating in demanding, high-
stakes environments where every second counts. Emergency nurses work 
around the clock, caring for patients of all ages and across every 
specialty--from cardiology and oncology to pediatrics and geriatrics.
  Emergency nurses are heroes, often the first point of contact for 
patients within the ER, and they provide comfort and attentive care 
during an uncertain or stressful time for patients and their families. 
Their critical thinking skills and their compassion for their patients 
make their role essential for preserving our Nations healthcare 
system.
  It is important that we give our emergency nurses the praise and 
attention they deserve during Emergency Nurses Week to show our 
appreciation for the dedication they have to our Nations health and 
for the millions of lives they touch on a daily basis. Were forever 
grateful for their sacrifice.
I rise today to recognize Frank Esten Cook 
III and his service to his country. Frank was born in Washington, D.C. 
on March 25, 1963, and passed away in Richmond, Kentucky on September 
13, 2025. He was an avid outdoorsman, boater, and hunter.
  Frank was a U.S. Army veteran and served his country as a 
commissioned officer. His first love, however, was serving as a non-
commissioned officer as a Blackhawk helicopter Crew Chief with the 
160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR).
  In 1994, Frank was awarded Night Stalker Soldier of the Year for 
Outstanding Individual Contribution to Army Special Operation Aviation. 
This award was sponsored by Robertson Research Group, Inc.
  Frank was tough in every sense of the word, but he also cared deeply 
for his friends, family, and country. He would give you the shirt off 
his back, if you really needed it. He taught his family the value of 
being tough and rolling with what life gives you. He was fond of the 
saying ``rub some dirt on it, youll be fine, which carries weight 
with everyone who knew him.
  Frank took immense pride in being a Night Stalker. These men and 
women are some of the best rotary wing aviator crews in the world. 
Franks attention to detail, his skills, and his tenacity drove him to 
join this elite regiment.
  Frank was very proud of both of his sons, Frank E. Cook IV (Frankie) 
of Jersey City, NJ and Anthony Guidi of Aloha. OR. As Frankie says, 
``My dad wouldnt want anyone to cry over him. So today Mr. Speaker, 
we wont cry over him but rather honor this man as a veteran, a father, 
a brother, a son, and an American.
I rise today to recognize 
the officers and crew of the USS Pierre (LCS 38) as they prepare for 
the commissioning of their ship, the 19th and final Independence-
variant Littoral Combat Ship of the United States Navy.
  The USS Pierre is the second Navy vessel to bear the name of South 
Dakotas capital city. Littoral combat ships are fast, agile, and 
mission-focused, built to counter 21st-century coastal threats while 
ensuring security and supporting joint operations across the globe. The 
men and women who serve aboard the USS Pierre will carry forward this 
mission with dedication and distinction.
  For the people of South Dakota, it is a great honor to see the name 
of our capital city once again sail under the flag of the United States 
Navy. This ship and her crew will continue a proud legacy of service 
that began with the first USS Pierre during World War II.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
officers and crew of the newly commissioned USS Pierre (LCS 38). We 
honor their commitment and thank them for their service.
