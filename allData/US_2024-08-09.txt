   CELEBRATING MILLARD FILLMORE SUBURBAN HOSPITAL&#x27;S 50TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital. For half a century, 
Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital has provided the highest level of 
healthcare to the Town of Amherst and the Weston New York community.
  On August 12, 1974, Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital opened as a 
full service community hospital with 150 beds. This achievement was the 
culmination of thirty years of hard work from community members and 
organizations in the Town of Amherst and the Town of Clarence. The 
hospital was built on 31.5 acres of land generously donated by Charles 
K. Basset, who wanted to address the ever-growing need to have a 
hospital in the community.
  Additionally, the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary of the Amherst-Clarence Hospital 
Association was instrumental in the hospital&#x27;s development, pledging 
over $100,000 in 1969 for its construction. The Women&#x27;s Board of 
Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital continues to play a vital role in 
the hospital today, hosting fundraisers to support facility upgrades 
and fund services in the community.
  Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital underwent significant expansions 
and renovations in 1987, 2008, 2015, and 2018, now standing as a four-
story, 400,000 square foot facility. The 2015 expansion, in 
collaboration with John R. Oishei Children&#x27;s Hospital, added a Level II 
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to the hospital. This addition has allowed 
for Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital to bring comprehensive maternity 
care to the northtowns of Western New York.
  Today, Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital is a full acute care 
hospital with 265 beds. It provides inpatient and outpatient care, 
diagnostic testing, and subspecialty services equivalent to those often 
seen in city medical centers. Further, Millard Fillmore Suburban 
Hospital was one of the first hospitals in Western New York to offer 
robotic surgery, with a current fleet of five robotic-assisted 
consoles.
  Please join me in congratulating the employees and leadership of 
Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital on their 50th anniversary and 
thanking them for providing quality medical care to Western New York.

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Robert Watts on 
his 90th birthday. Known as Bobby to many, Mr. Watts is revered for his 
commitment to the Buffalo community, his entrepreneurial spirit, and 
his selfless service to our country.
  Born on September 2, 1934, Mr. Watts grew up in Buffalo, New York 
with his parents, Luther and Lola Watts, and his five siblings. After 
graduating from Seneca High School, Mr. Watts enlisted in the United 
States Navy in 1951. Stationed in Korea, Mr. Watts served his country 
with pride until his honorable discharge in 1959.
  After his service in the military, Mr. Watts returned to his hometown 
of Buffalo. Here, he worked diligently at Bethlehem Steel, Curtiss-
Wright Corporation, and New York State Thruway Authority and the 
Department of Corrections. Mr. Watts&#x27; exceptional work ethic and 
commitment to service shone through in every role he held.
  Embracing his entrepreneurial ambitions, Mr. Watts opened the Stadium 
Liquor Store at the corner of Best Street and Jefferson Avenue, by the 
historic War Memorial Stadium, the then-home of the Buffalo Bills. For 
nearly 15 years, Mr. Watts&#x27; store was a community fixture, providing 
outstanding service to thousands of loyal customers and fans.
  Following his time as a business owner, Mr. Watts joined the NFTA as 
a bus driver. He always engaged in friendly conversations with 
travelers, bringing a smile to passengers&#x27; days. After a long and 
successful career, Mr. Watts entered a well-deserved retirement in 
1999.
  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Mr. Watts is deeply 
committed to his faith. As a lifelong member of the Pilgrim Baptist 
Church, Mr. Watts is a cherished friend and mentor to all who attend 
the church.
  Today, Mr. Watts is a devoted and loving husband, father, and 
brother. He continues to be an inspiration to all who know him, sharing 
his compassion and dedication to serving others. Please join me in 
celebrating Mr. Robert Watts on his 90th birthday and thanking him for 
his service to our country and to our Buffalo community.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate 
the DEA&#x27;s Tucson District Office EG-46 for their recognition at the 
U.S. Interdiction Coordinator Awards.
  Strengthening border security and immigration enforcement, while 
ensuring public safety, is a must for our border communities.
  These brave men and women put their lives on the line for us every 
day, serving on the frontline and ensuring the safety of our 
communities.
  Their hard work and dedication are vital in combating cartels, 
stopping the flow of drugs, and protecting the citizens of southern 
Arizona.
  In 2023, the Tucson District Office EG-46 conducted 45 drug and drug 
conspiracy investigations.
  One of their major efforts was the DEA Initiative ``Operation 
Overdrive&#x27;&#x27; in April 2023, during which this dedicated group arrested 
approximately 80 percent of their identified targets.
  They seized 1.1 million fentanyl pills, 26.4 pounds of fentanyl 
powder, and 42 pounds of methamphetamine--equating to 4.26 million 
deadly doses of fentanyl and 78,000 deadly doses of methamphetamine.
  I am truly grateful for the relentless efforts and their commitment 
to protecting our community.
  I thank them for their service and dedication to protecting our 
Arizona&#x27;s District 6.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize James 
W. Thompson for his record-breaking catch. A native of St. Simons, 21-
year-old James set a new state record for an almaco jack caught on July 
28th.
  Measuring in at a whopping 27 pounds and 8 ounces, it broke the 
previous record by 4 pounds. This is no small feat. The almaco jack is 
known for its strength and stamina, humbling anglers who do not take it 
seriously. With this catch, James proved that he is a skilled 
fisherman.
  This is the third time in the past year alone that the record for 
almaco jack has been broken. It is a reminder that Georgia&#x27;s coastal 
waters provide exceptional fishing for anglers of all ages.
  It&#x27;s important that we maintain the health and biodiversity of 
Georgia&#x27;s waters, so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy one 
of our states&#x27; favorite pastimes.

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kimberly 
Allen, a Sahuarita High School student, who scored a perfect 36 on the 
ACT exam.
  With this achievement, Kimberly joined a select group, as only 0.18 
percent of test takers achieved a perfect score in 2023.
  This means that, out of nearly two million students, just 2,543 
students in the country earned this honor.
  Kimberly&#x27;s achievements go beyond academics. She serves on the 
Sahuarita Teen Advisory Board, where she organizes events and programs 
for local teens.
  She also volunteers with the Animal League of Green Valley, sharing 
her lifelong love of animals.
  As for her future, Kimberly aspires to pursue a career that combines 
her passions for science and art.
  I am excited to see what the future holds for Kimberly and 
congratulate her on this incredible achievement.
  I am proud to represent her and so many other bright students in 
Congress.

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lupita 
Murillo on her well-deserved retirement after nearly five decades of 
dedicated service with KVOA News 4 in Tucson.
  During her time at KVOA, Lupita&#x27;s specialized crime reporting made a 
significant impact on the Tucson community.
  Her remarkable career began in Weslaco, Texas, where she broke 
barriers as south Texas&#x27; first Hispanic female broadcaster.
  Beyond her journalistic accomplishments, Lupita has been a tireless 
advocate and volunteer for organizations such as Las Familias, the 
People With AIDS Coalition of Tucson, and the Children&#x27;s Miracle 
Network Telethon.
  Lupita will be missed, but her lasting impact on KVOA will continue 
to inspire future generations of journalists and community advocates 
throughout southern Arizona.
  I am proud to represent trailblazers like Lupita in my district.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Conrad 
Shipyard for its delivery of the first new class Yard, Repair, 
Berthing, and Messing (YRBM) vessel to the U.S. Navy.
  Conrad Shipyard has a legacy of quality and safety in providing 
premier vessels to the U.S. government and commercial enterprise. The 
new class of YRBM vessels are needed to modernize the living and 
housing conditions for thousands of Navy personnel. These vessels will 
provide a temporary home for our service men and women whose other 
vessels are in port for repair and maintenance.
  I have had the privilege of touring Conrad Shipyard in Morgan City, 
Louisiana and seeing firsthand the finished product of a dedicated, 
skilled workforce. The work being done at Conrad and shipyards in South 
Louisiana drives economic growth, brings jobs and prosperity to our 
community, and provides our Armed Forces with the necessary tools to 
secure America.
  The new class of YRBM barge craft are essential to the modernization 
effort led by the U.S. Navy. We should all celebrate Conrad Shipyard&#x27;s 
delivery of the first new class YRBM vessel to the U.S. Navy, on track 
and on schedule, and the work they continue to accomplish for the 
betterment of the U.S. military.
  On behalf of Louisiana&#x27;s 3rd District, I congratulate Conrad Shipyard 
on this momentous achievement. I am grateful to the skilled workforce 
at Conrad for making this possible and thank them for the vital part 
they play in bolstering our defense maritime industrial base.

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I use today to honor Sherman L. Jenkins for 
his exceptional contributions to our community, particularly through 
his work with the Quad County African American Chamber of Commerce and 
his extensive service to the City of Aurora. As a stalwart advocate for 
economic development, Sherman has dedicated over 20 years to enhancing 
the prosperity of the city. His leadership as the Assistant Director 
and later as the Executive Director of the Aurora Economic Development 
Commission was marked by key initiatives, such as the successful 
opening of the Hollywood Casino and the establishment of the Chicago 
Premium Outlet Mall. These milestones not only raised Aurora&#x27;s profile, 
but also significantly contributed to the local economy.
  In addition to his professional achievements, Sherman&#x27;s commitment to 
community engagement is unparalleled. Even after his retirement in 
2012, he remained an active force within the city, serving as an 
alderman at-large for six years, participating in community events, and 
driving initiatives that foster collaboration and growth.
  Moreover, Sherman&#x27;s passion for community service extends beyond his 
professional endeavors. As a founding member of the Quad County African 
American Chamber of Commerce, he has played a pivotal role in 
advocating for the African American business community and ensuring 
that their voices are heard.
  His involvement with various organizations, including the Rotary Club 
of Aurora, the Aurora Public Library Foundation, the Ely Chapter of 
Lambda Alpha International, and the Northern Lights Development 
Corporation, exemplify his commitment to civic duty and community well-
being.
  As he embarks on the next chapter of his life, we celebrate his 
legacy and the indelible mark he has left on the city. We look forward 
to seeing his contributions continue to inspire future generations 
through his digital media company, SLJ Communications, Inc., through 
which he produces the ``Tell Me Something Good&#x27;&#x27; monthly publication 
that covers African American life outside the City of Chicago, and 
authored Ted Strong, Jr.: The Untold Story of an Original Harlem 
Globetrotter and Negro Leagues All-Star.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate the legacy of Sherman L. Jenkins 
and ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him well in all his future 
pursuits as he enjoys time with his wife, Juliette, his 3 adult 
children, and his 3 grandchildren, Jai, Makayla, and Xavier.

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
sacrifice of Air Force 1st Lt. Raymond T. Plevyak, who will be honored 
with a Memorial Headstone Marker Service at Arlington National 
Cemetery.
  Air Force 1st Lt. Plevyak was a distinguished F-51D Mustang pilot who 
went missing in action during the Korean War in 1952.
  Though he was declared Killed in Action (KIA) in December of 1953, 
his bravery and commitment to his country remain deeply honored.
  Plevyak entered the U.S. Air Force from Pennsylvania and was assigned 
to the 67th Fighter-Bomber squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing.
  On March 1, 1952, he departed Hoengsong Air Base in Korea, piloting 
an F-51D Mustang with the call sign ``Topkick Fox Three.&#x27;&#x27;
  After completing its primary mission of targeting rail lines, the 
``Topkick Fox&#x27;&#x27; flight of four took fire on its secondary 
reconnaissance mission, resulting in damage to the lead aircraft.
  It was during this mission that 1st Lt. Plevyak went missing.
  Despite extensive searches by his fellow pilots, he was never found 
and remains unaccounted for.
  Plevyak&#x27;s name is memorialized on the Courts of the Missing at the 
National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific and on the Korean War 
Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C.
  Along with other medals and citations, he is a Purple Heart 
recipient. Today, we honor his memory and the extraordinary sacrifice 
he made in service to our Nation.
  We must always recognize and honor the service members that made the 
ultimate sacrifice, like 1st Lt. Plevyak. We thank him and his family 
for his service.

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of 
two Georgia national guard soldiers, Travis Jordan Pameni and Owen 
James Elliott. Both at the young age of 23, Travis and Owen passed away 
in Baghdad on Wednesday from unrelated, non-combat causes.
  Mr. Pameni was assigned to the 1st Batallion of the 121st Infantry 
Regiment based in Lawrenceville, and Mr. Elliott was assigned to the 
1st Batallion of the 188th Field Artillery Regiment based in Savannah. 
Mr. Elliott&#x27;s unit was deployed in the Middle East in December of 2023 
and focused on air defense artillery.
  We are extremely saddened by the loss of Specialists Pameni and 
Elliott. Both were devoted, selfless individuals, who served the state 
of Georgia and our Nation.
  The contributions and memory of Specialists Pameni and Elliott will 
forever be cherished by the state of Georgia and our country. I extend

[[Page E815]]

Anniversary of Operation Dragoon and the Southern France Campaign--The 
Second D-Day in France and the liberation of Southern France.
  Operation Dragoon began on 15 August 1944 and the subsequent Southern 
France Campaign lasted until 14 September 1944. The 7th U.S. Army under 
Lieutenant General Alexander M. Patch, commanded the VIth U.S. Corps 
under Major General Lucian K. Truscott, II, comprised of three of the 
Army&#x27;s most combat-experienced divisions--the 3rd Infantry Division 
commanded by Major General John Wilson ``Iron Mike&#x27;&#x27; O&#x27;Daniel, the 36th 
Infantry Division commanded by Major General John E. Dahlquist, and the 
45th Infantry Division commanded by Major General William W. Eagles, 
and Corps troops; the 1st Airborne Task Force commanded by Brigadier 
General Robert T. Frederick, the Canadian-American 1st Special Service 
Force commanded by Colonel Edwin A. Walker, and French Army B, later to 
be renamed the 1st French Army, commanded by General Jean de Lattre de 
Tassigny. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) teams were inserted in the 
months to link up with French Forces of the Interior (FFI, of the 
Resistance) prior to prepare for the invasion. The landing forces were 
ably supported by the Mediterranean Allied Air Force under Lieutenant 
General Ira C. Eaker and the Western Naval Task Force under Vice 
Admiral Henry K. Hewitt, conducted the second largest amphibious 
landing in Europe on 15 August 1944.
  The primary objective of Operation Dragoon was to threaten the 
southern flank of Nazi forces fighting in northern France. Further 
objectives were the seizing of the ports of Toulon and Marseille to 
provide critical logistical support for Allied forces fighting in the 
whole of France, the introduction of French forces into France, and the 
stationing of Allied Air Forces in Southern France, to better support 
combat operations.
  Allied military personnel from France, the United Kingdom, the 
Netherlands, Canada, Greece, and Poland participated in Operation 
Dragoon and provided critical air and naval support to open the second 
front in Southern France. 885 ships and landing craft, carrying nearly 
1,375 smaller landing craft, with their crews, carried 151,000 troops, 
21,400 trucks, tanks, tank destroyers, prime-movers, bulldozers, 
tractors and other vehicles to the beaches. Included were 40,850 French 
personnel and 2,610 vehicles of the 1st French Army. 444 aircraft 
sorties and 408 glider sorties delivered 6,488 paratroopers, 2,611 
glider troops, 213 pieces of artillery, and 221 vehicles to the target 
area.
  The 1st Airborne Task Force successfully landed near Le Muy, La 
Motte, and Les Arcs causing serious disarray in German command channels 
which prevented a rapid coordinated response to the main force 
landings. Draguignan fell on 16 August. The 1st Special Service Force 
cleared the offshore islands of Port Cros and Levant to secure the 
southern flank of the assault. Landing on the morning of 15 August all 
units successfully overwhelmed German defense and expanded the 
beachhead. The 3rd Infantry Division cleared the St. Tropez Peninsula, 
liberating the villages of St. Tropez and Cogolin after landing at 
Ramatuelle, La Croix-Valmer, and Cavalaire-sur-Mer. The 45th Infantry 
Division liberated Sainte Maxine and the 36th Infantry Division 
liberated St. Raphael. Fighting through the Maures and Esterel hill 
masses all units reached the Blue Line, the point where the beachhead 
could no longer be threatened by enemy counterattack. On 17 August the 
Truscott&#x27;s VIth Corps launched its aggressive pursuit of German forces 
and through the speed of its advance prevented the establishment of 
defensive positions east of the Rhone Valley. The Corps&#x27; Task Force 
Butler, following the historic Route Napoleon through the Maritime 
Alps, the 36th Infantry Division, and 45th Infantry Division rapidly 
moved north in an effort to flank and trap the German 19th Army 
withdrawing up the Rhone Valley with the 45th Infantry Division 
liberating Barjols and clearing the Valensole Plateau, TF Butler and 
the 36th Infantry Division liberating Sisteron, Gap, and Grenoble. The 
3rd Infantry Division, attacked west along the Argens valley along the 
Route Nationale (RN) 7, guarding the northern flank of French forces 
reducing Toulon and Marseille and blocking a possible German counter-
attack, in the process liberating Le Luc (in cooperation with the 45th 
Infantry Division and French Armored Command Sudre)--a vital road 
junction on RN 7, Brignoles, and numerous communities along the 
approach to Aix-en-Provence including Vauvenargues and Saint-Marc-
Jaumegarde abutting Mont St. Victoire. While Task Force Butler, then 
the 36th Infantry Division with attached units from the 45th Infantry 
Division, fought in the Montelimar Battle Square north of the city of 
Montelimar from 21 to 29 August, the 3rd Infantry Division continued to 
press against 19th Army rearguard forces, liberating numerous 
communities including Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, Lancon-Provence, Salon-
de-Provence, Orange, Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Bollene, Saint-Paul-Trois-
Chateaux, Valreas, Pierrelatte, La Garde-Adhemar and culminated at the 
important city of Montelimar on 28 August. French Army B liberated 
Toulon and Marseille on 28 August, taking 1,825 casualties but taking 
11,000 Nazi prisoners.
  On 29 August the 3rd Infantry Division established contact with the 
36th Infantry Division near the villages of Sauzet and La Laupie 
northeast of the city. The 1st Airborne Task Force and 1st Special 
Service Force continued to guard the 7th Army&#x27;s right flank from any 
German attack from Italy and reduced German forces in the Maritime Alps 
along the Italian Border--liberating the French Riviera cities of 
Cannes, Nice and Grasse.
  The 19th Army continued its withdrawal towards Lyon, seeking to 
establish a coherent defensive line to oppose 7th Army&#x27;s rapid advance, 
which drove first towards Lyon and then shifted its axis to Dijon. The 
7th Army liberated Lyon on 3 September and continued to press northeast 
to reach the Belfort Gap, the traditional approach to the Rhine River 
Valley. The 3rd Infantry Division liberated Besancon on 7 September 
after a tough 3-day fight. The speed of the 7th Army advance prevented 
the 19th Army&#x27;s anchoring its defense on Dijon, it therefore withdrew 
towards the base of the Vosges Mountains. Approaching the Vosges, the 
Vlth Corps&#x27; three divisions faced stiffening German resistance. The 3rd 
Infantry Division liberated Vesoul on 12 September and by 14 September 
the Corps&#x27; three divisions were positioned near the towns of 
Fougerolles, Luxeuil, Lure, and Villersexel. French forces made contact 
with elements of the 3rd Army near Dijon on 11 September. With this 
juncture of 3rd and 7th Army forces the Southern France Campaign came 
to an end. The 6th Army Group was activated on 15 September and 
transferred from the Mediterranean Theater to GEN Eisenhower&#x27;s European 
Theater of Operations. French forces under 7th Army control were re-
designated the 1st French Army and became a separate command under 6th 
Army Group control.
  Under the aggressive leadership of LTG Patch, MG Truscott, and 
General Delattre de Tassigny U.S. and Allied forces of the 6th Army 
Group and its supporting air and naval support severely damaged the 
German 19th Army and during the 30-day Southern France Campaign moved 
over 400 miles from the landing beaches in Provence to link up with 
General Eisenhower&#x27;s forces fighting their way from Normandy on 11 
September 1944. Over \2/3\ of France were liberated in the space of one 
month. French Forces of the Interior (the Resistance) contributed 
tremendously to Dragoon&#x27;s success providing critical intelligence in 
the preparation for the landings and with countless small unit actions 
which harassed Nazi forces throughout the campaign. In the 30-day 
campaign to liberate Southern France the U.S. forces suffered 4,500 
battle casualties and 5,300 non-battle casualties Nazi forces are 
assessed as having 7,000 killed in action, 21,000 wounded in action, 
and 131,250 prisoners of war.
  Medals of Honor were awarded to the following 3rd Infantry Division 
soldiers during the Southern France Campaign: SSG James P. Connor, 15 
August in Cavalaire-sur-Mer, SSG Stanley Bender, 17 August in La Londe-
les-Maures; T/5 Robert D. Maxwell 7 September in Besancon; 2LT Raymond 
Zussman on 12 September in Noroy-le-Bourg, and 1LI John J. Tominac on 
12 September in Vesoul. Among the Distinguished Service Cross 
recipients was a young SSG in the 15th Infantry Regiment, Audie Murphy, 
whose action came near Ramatuelle on 15 August and who would go on to 
become the most-decorated soldier and best-known soldier of WWII. Other 
Medal of Honor recipients were 2LT Stephen R. Gregg from the 36th 
Infantry Division on 27 August near Montelimar and 2LT Almond E. Fisher 
of the 45th Infantry Division on 12-13 September near Grammont.
  Unit awards included Presidential Unit Citations to the following 3rd 
Infantry Division units: 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment for its 
performance in Montelimar on 27 August embroidered Montelimar and the 
1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment for Besancon 6-7 September 
embroidered Besancon; and to the 36th Infantry Division the 1st 
Battalion, 141st Infantry 15-16 August embroidered Southern France and 
the 3rd Battalion, 143rd Infantry Regiment 26-29 August for fighting 
embroidered Montelimar; and Cannon Company, 442nd Infantry Regiment for 
the full campaign embroidered Southern France.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the entire House of Representatives join me 
in congratulating and thanking the surviving veterans of Operation 
Dragoon and the Southern France Campaign on the occasion of the 
upcoming 80th anniversary of this highly successful operation which 
liberated Southern France and played a critical role in the Allied 
victory in Europe in WWII.

  RECOGNIZING UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS WORLD WAR II VETERAN JOSEPH 
                        DEMARCO&#x27;S 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
exceptional constituent from my district, Joseph DeMarco. Throughout 
his life, Joe has embodied a selfless and fearless spirit, resulting in 
a life rich in stories and memories. I commend Joe for his service to 
our country and thank him for his great sacrifices and honorable 
legacy. As he celebrates his 100th birthday, I would like to recognize 
Joe and wish happiness for him and his family.
  A Pennsylvania native, Joe was born and raised in South Philadelphia 
and still considers it to be ``The best place around&#x27;&#x27;. A born fighter, 
Joe picked up boxing at a young age, facing the world without fear. He 
embodied this spirit in every aspect of his life, and following the 
attack on Pearl Harbor, decided without hesitation to serve his 
country. Remarkably, Joe was still only 17, meaning he had to forge his 
parents&#x27; signatures to join the United States Marine Corps. Joe began 
Boot Camp at Camp Lejeune, but his training was cut short after his 
father found him and made him come home. Unfettered in his mission, Joe 
re-enlisted 6 months later when he turned 18. He went back to Camp 
Lejeune and completed boot camp. Joe excelled in the Marines--his 
lifelong love of fighting served him well in the Marines. Growing up 
boxing taught him to never back down from a fight, a lesson he carried 
boldly throughout his time in active duty.
  At the start of his service, Joe was sent aboard a ship originally 
headed for Guadalcanal. However, the ship was redirected to the Panama 
Canal out of fear of an Axis attack on the horizon. While in Panama, 
Joe was stationed on watch duty, where he had a remarkably close 
encounter during a Japanese ambush. This ambush killed a Marine who was 
on his previous post, a solemn reminder of the danger constantly 
lurking in the seas. After Panama, Joe was sent to Texas. Once a few 
years passed, he once again boarded a ship to go to Guadalcanal, but 
was suddenly redirected back to Panama, on the same track as his first 
ship years before. Joe stayed in Panama for about another year, serving 
his country honorably. Despite the discipline and service Joe embodied 
daily, he never lost his youthful spirit from his days in South Philly. 
Joe remembers how in Marine Corps, his Sergeant would catch him 
shooting dice and make him clean the entire barracks with a toothbrush.
  Upon returning home to South Philadelphia, Joe worked as a presser in 
a tailor shop, relishing trips to Atlantic City and attending weekly 
dances with friends. It was at one of these dances that he met his 
wife, with whom he raised two daughters and a son. His family faced 
hardships, including the early passing of his son and daughter. Joe is 
currently survived by his daughter Paula.
  He worked in the garment manufacturing industry for many years. He 
also worked selling beer at the Phillies games and worked as a waiter 
at night. He loves Phillies sports, especially baseball and football. 
He enjoys trips to Atlantic City to play craps, and he loves to gamble 
(for better or worse). He also loves the classic crooners, with the 
greats like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Nat King Cole constantly on 
play.
  I remain deeply appreciative to Joe DeMarco for his life of service 
and sacrifice for our community, district, and country. His commitment 
to his fellow neighbors, veterans, and service members alike is a 
testament to his character and spirit. I am more than honored to 
recognize him today and wish him nothing but the best for his 100th 
birthday and the future beyond.

           TRIBUTE TO FAIRFAX HIGH SCHOOL&#x27;S 100TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fairfax High 
School in Los Angeles, California upon its 100th Anniversary.
  Fairfax High School first opened its doors in 1924, welcoming 
students onto its campus. It was named after Lord Fairfax, an inspiring 
mentor and friend to future U.S. President George Washington. The 
school&#x27;s first Principal was Rae G. Van Cleve, who served until 1938. 
Originally designed as an agricultural and mechanical school that 
taught ``practical&#x27;&#x27; skills, programs on the 28-acre campus included 
architecture, forestry, agronomy, and landscaping gardening, as 
students in that area lived in what was then a largely rural part of 
Los Angeles. In a few short years, and after the gymnasium and a fine 
arts building were added, the high school was already an established, 
esteemed institution in the Fairfax area of Los Angeles.
  During World War II, many Fairfax students and alumni joined the war 
effort by enlisting in the military, selling bonds and holding 
recycling drives. In the 1950&#x27;s the school had a large Jewish student 
body and Modern Hebrew classes were taught. The 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s saw 
many foreign languages being offered including Latin, German, Hebrew 
and Chinese. While most of the original campus facilities were 
demolished in 1966 due to new seismic standards, the iconic rotunda and 
historic auditorium were spared by preservationists and retrofitted. In 
1981 the Fairfax Magnet Center for Visual Arts opened and remains the 
only visual arts magnet in the Los Angeles Unified School District and 
in 1984, Dr. Virginia Uribe founded Project 10 at Fairfax High School, 
the nation&#x27;s first on-site program that welcomed and supported LGBTQ+ 
students in a school setting. In the mid-1990&#x27;s, a group of local 
theater artists held the first Melrose Trading Post flea market to 
support art, community and small business. Because of its success, the 
weekly marketplace now hosts hundreds of unique vendors featuring local 
dancers, musicians and thespians, and works with Greenway Arts Alliance 
to support Fairfax High School&#x27;s leadership and arts programs.
  For a century, Fairfax High School has provided thousands of students 
with an excellent education. The school has produced notable alumni 
across many fields, including well-known late actors Mickey Rooney, 
Carole Lombard, and Ricardo Montalban, former Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, molecular biologist and public health 
advocate Marion Nestle, and former Los Angeles Clippers basketball 
player Craig Smith.
  I ask all Members to join me today in honoring Fairfax High School 
upon its centennial celebration. The entire Los Angeles community joins 
me in thanking the school for the outstanding educational opportunities 
it has provided for the youth of California&#x27;s 30th Congressional 
District.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 9, 2024

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Reverend Kathy 
Cooper Ledesma upon her retirement as the Co-Senior Pastor of the 
Hollywood United Methodist Church (HUMC), in Los Angeles, California.
  Reverend Kathy Cooper Ledesma received a Bachelor of Arts degree from 
Occidental College in 1982 and a Master of Divinity from the Claremont 
School of Theology in 1988. Upon completion of her education, Kathy 
began her service for the California Council of Churches, specializing 
in education and public policy. Under her outstanding direction as 
Board Chair, she accomplished several statewide projects on welfare 
reform faith-based childcare, and interfaith relations. In 2005, Rev. 
Cooper Ledesma brought her tremendous leadership skills to the 
University of Southern California Center for Religion and Civic Culture 
where she worked as a project specialist on issues related to faith 
communities and preschool for all, earning the Boutillier Award for 
Distinguished Ecumenical Service.
  Rev. Cooper Ledesma is an elder and leading force in the California-
Pacific Conference of the United Methodist Church, as well a dedicated 
member of Hollywood 4WRD, a coalition supporting our unhoused 
neighbors. As one of the founding leaders of the Homeless Task Force of 
the Hollywood area faith entities (LA VOICE), Kathy welcomes all with 
unfailing compassion and limitless kindness, providing hygiene packs 
and meals for the unhoused population, ensuring that everyone is served 
both physically and spiritually. Her extensive work with the LGBTQ+ 
community during her time as the Chair of the Community Advisory Panel 
of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) HIV/AIDS Education 
and Prevention Unit has helped countless people, as has her service as 
the Co-Chair of the Bishop&#x27;s Task Force on Children and Poverty and a 
member of the Los Angeles County&#x27;s Safe Surrender Task Force.
  Founded in 1909, the Hollywood United Methodist Church has provided 
unwavering support and spiritual guidance to its congregants for over a 
century. Serving the Los Angeles United Methodist Church congregation 
since 2006, Rev. Cooper Ledesma has worked tirelessly to build faith 
and spirituality in the heart of Hollywood. For over thirty years, the 
HUMC has offered supportive services and pastoral counseling for 
persons and their family members living with HIV/AIDS. The church&#x27;s 
installation of the enormous Red Ribbons of Love on both campuses, a 
universal symbol of awareness and support for those living with HIV/
AIDS, shapes the sanctuary to be a place of ``hope and love.&#x27;&#x27; Kathy&#x27;s 
bright spirit cultivates a vibrant and inclusive congregation that 
celebrates diversity. Under her leadership as Co-Senior Pastor, the 
HUMC has excelled in outreach towards young urban professionals, 
progressives, and families with children.
  Rev. Cooper Ledesma is a loving mother of two adult children with her 
late husband, Rev. Rene Ledesma, and a devoted member of the community.
  After over four decades of service, it is an honor to pay homage to 
Rev. Kathy Cooper Ledesma for her contributions to aiding the unhoused 
population and promoting faith inclusivity. It has been a great 
privilege to work with Kathy over the years and see her tremendous 
impact on the community. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
this remarkable, well-respected reverend in California&#x27;s 30th 
Congressional District, Rev. Kathy Cooper Ledesma.
