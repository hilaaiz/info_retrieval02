               CELEBRATING JACK RICHTMAN&#x27;S 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BILL FOSTER

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 30, 2024

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a truly remarkable 
milestone--the 100th birthday of Mr. Jack Richtman, a true American 
hero.
  Jack&#x27;s life is a testament to resilience, service, and the enduring 
power of family. A longtime resident of Elburn, Illinois, Jack served 
our Nation with distinction during World War II. Six months after D-
Day, he landed on the beaches of Normandy, bravely fighting in six 
battles as a gunner on a mortar unit for the Army&#x27;s 71st Infantry 
Division. His contributions were instrumental in aiding Allied forces 
in post-war efforts throughout Europe.

[[Page E790]]

  Growing up on the South Side of Chicago, he faced the challenges of 
the Great Depression, eventually moving to Wisconsin to continue his 
education. While a Junior in high school, Jack&#x27;s patriotism ignited 
after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and he enlisted in the Army Air 
Corps. His dedication to service led him to the artillery unit, where 
he honed his skills through rigorous training in California. After the 
war, Jack served in Austria and returned home with a lifetime of 
memories and a heart full of gratitude for his fellow servicemembers 
and the freedoms he defended.
  Upon returning home, Jack married his high school sweetheart, Karwyn, 
building a life filled with love in St. Paul, Minnesota. Their union 
blossomed into a remarkable family of 12 children, a testament to their 
unwavering commitment to each other. With a degree in chemistry, Jack&#x27;s 
career led him to Illinois in 1971, eventually landing in Elburn in the 
1990&#x27;s, where he has resided ever since.
  After 32 years of marriage his wife Karwyn passed away in 1978, but 
Jack&#x27;s love for family never wavered. He found love again with Mary 
Perkins, a widow with eight children, whom he married in 1980. This 
union brought together a blended family of 19 children, and has 
blossomed to include 52 grandchildren, and 52 great-grandchildren.
  Today, surrounded by his loving family, he stands as a beacon of 
strength, embodying the spirit of sacrifice and service that defined 
his generation. Jack continues to live a fulfilling and energetic life 
in Elburn with his son, Tom.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate Jack Richtman and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Jack Richtman&#x27;s extraordinary life 
and unwavering patriotism. He is an inspiration to us all, and his 
100th birthday serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by those who 
came before us.

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and 
recognize the Reeves-Reed Arboretum on their 50-year anniversary. I am 
grateful to be able to celebrate this incredible milestone with the 
Reeves-Reed family and our community. The Reeves-Reed Arboretum is a 
beautiful natural setting of a forest and gardens that engages, 
enriches, and teaches its visitors about environmental stewardship. For 
the past 50 years, they have shown their dedication to our community 
through programs and activities for all ages to grow through connecting 
with nature. Reeves-Reed has something for everyone, including summer 
camps for children, gardening and hiking groups, scout events, and many 
opportunities to learn and reflect. As a non-profit organization, the 
Arboretum and its staff are dedicated to their mission of helping our 
community and being an educational and spiritual resource for its 
visitors. Reeves-Reed is also a cornerstone of Summit&#x27;s cultural 
landscape, and its 13.5 acres are listed on both the National and State 
Registers of Historic Places. As we reflect on the past 50 years at 
Reeves-Reed they have exceeded the expectations and I know they will 
continue to do so for the next 50 years to come. I am honored to have 
such an amazing community in the 7th Congressional District, and I look 
forward to what is to come.

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
76th anniversary of City Market, the supplier to Sea Island Corporation 
and many other restaurants in South Georgia.
  City Market was founded in 1848 in Brunswick by Harold Sigmund and 
E.W. Stanford, Sr. Upon E.W. Stanford, Sr.&#x27;s death that same year, his 
18-year-old son and E.W. ``Captain Red&#x27;&#x27; Stanford, Jr. took over the 
business. The two eventually bought out Mr. Sigmond and continued 
building a great reputation for the business.
  City Market then moved to its current location on Gloucester Street 
in 1969. After his passing, Captain Red left the legacy of City Market 
to his grandson, Frank ``Little Red&#x27;&#x27; Owens, Jr., as well as his 
brother and sons, Walker and Wyatt Owens. Left to run the packing house 
was his son-in-law, Bruce Collins, Sr.
  Through the dedication of the family and its loyal customers, City 
Market has continued to grow and prosper. Congratulations to City 
Market, a true family business, on 76 years of success and hard work.

                         HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 30, 2024

  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate TAC (The Abilities 
Connection) Industries, a nonprofit organization located in my 
Congressional district, that provides job opportunities to people with 
disabilities through its participation in the AbilityOne Program. 
AbilityOne is a federal program that provides employment opportunities 
to approximately 40,000 people who are blind or have significant 
disabilities, including more than 2,500 veterans.
  TAC Industries recently received the 2024 Innovation Award at Source 
America&#x27;s annual X-Force conference in Orlando, Florida. This award 
honors a nonprofit that developed ``innovative work methods, products 
or services.&#x27;&#x27; TAC Industries partnered with Clark State College in 
Springfield, Ohio, which is also in my district, to create the Fresh 
Abilities restaurant, a farm-to-table quick service restaurant on the 
campus, which functions simultaneously as an employment center and a 
training program for workers with disabilities.
  Through their partnership, TAC developed a curriculum that included 
over 100 hours of classroom instruction and hands-on skill building. 
They utilized the college&#x27;s classroom facilities for their employees&#x27; 
food safety training. In the restaurant, the employees were then 
trained in how to prepare meals, how to make sales, and develop 
customer service skills.
  Employees at Fresh Abilities gained the unique experience of working 
in a safe, inclusive environment while getting the training and support 
they need to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. Clark State 
students, faculty and employees gained access to healthy food, and the 
college&#x27;s administration was able to divert funds previously spent on 
food service to other student-focused areas.
  For individuals with disabilities, the opportunity to pursue a 
fulfilling, meaningful career of one&#x27;s own choosing with a path for 
advancement is important to their quality of life. I appreciate the 
work TAC Industries undertakes to provide these employment and 
vocational opportunities, and congratulate them on receiving this 
prestigious award.

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Lourdes 
``Lulu&#x27;&#x27; Blacksmith on her retirement and to honor her many years of 
dedicated service to communities across Kane County and beyond.
  Dr. Blacksmith&#x27;s Journey is a testament to the American Dream. Born 
in Querendaro, Michoacan, Mexico, she arrived in the United States in 
1974, embracing a new land with open arms and a thirst for opportunity.
  Her career path reflects a commitment to public service and community 
engagement. Dr. Blacksmith began her exemplary career as the Manager of 
Community Outreach at AMITA Health Mercy Medical Center in Aurora, 
Illinois. She went on to serve as the Director of Community Relations 
and District Press Secretary for the Speaker of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, demonstrating her ability to navigate the complexities 
of government and advocate for the needs of constituents. Most 
recently, she served as the Managing Director of Community Engagement 
and Legislative Affairs for Elgin Community College, where she helped 
bridge the gap between education and the community.
  In addition to her professional achievements, Dr. Blacksmith has 
dedicated herself to empowering marginalized communities. In 1999, she 
founded Companeros en Salud, an organization that provides vital 
healthcare resources to the Hispanic community and other diverse 
groups. Her commitment to social justice is evident in her active 
membership in numerous organizations, including the Chicago 
Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP), the Community Foundation of 
the Fox River Valley, RISE of South Elgin, and the St. Charles Chamber 
of Commerce.
  Dr. Blacksmith&#x27;s tireless efforts have been recognized with numerous 
awards including the Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus Foundation&#x27;s 
Latino Leadership Award, the Quad County Urban League&#x27;s ``Women of 
Power&#x27;&#x27; Award, and the Chicago Latino Network&#x27;s Latina Professionals 
Award.
  Her academic achievements are equally impressive. Dr. Blacksmith 
earned her Doctor of Education degree in Leadership in Higher Education 
and Organizational Change from Benedictine University, a Masters degree 
in Higher Education Leadership from Northeastern Illinois University, 
her Bachelors degree in Liberal Arts with an emphasis on Multicultural 
Studies from DePaul University, and an Associate&#x27;s degree in Applied 
Sciences from Waubonsee Community College.
  Mr Speaker, I am proud to honor Dr. Lourdes ``Lulu&#x27;&#x27; Blacksmith. Her 
dedication, leadership, and unwavering commitment to serving others 
have left an indelible mark on our community. I ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating her as she embarks on this new chapter in her 
life with her husband Steve, two daughters Nikki and Stefanie, and her 
grandchildren Sophia and Stephen. We wish her the best in her well-
deserved retirement, and we express our gratitude for her contributions 
to Kane County and the Nation.

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and 
congratulate Westfield High School track coach Christopher Tafelski on 
his recent designation by the U.S. Boys&#x27; Track and Field and Cross 
Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) as the 2024 Boys&#x27; High School 
Track and Field Coach of the Year for the State of New Jersey. This is 
not Coach Tafelski&#x27;s first award from the USTFCCCA, and I am certain it

country programs at Westfield High School since 2004, Tafelski, a WHS 
alum himself, has worked to build a team that is not only award-
winning, but one with a strong sense of community. Tafelski has led the 
renowned WHS track and field and cross country teams to multiple 
national qualifications and state championship titles among countless 
other accolades. I am honored to have such a dedicated coach and 
educator in out district, and I look forward to seeing both Coach 
Tafelski and the Westfield track and field and cross country programs 
continue to thrive in the years to come.

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of 
William Arthur ``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Hughes, who sadly passed at the age of 96.
  Bill served for three years in the United States Marine Corps and

 INTRODUCTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY OFFICER PROTECTION ACT 
                                OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 30, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Department of the 
Treasury Officer Protection Act of 2024. This bill would help protect 
Treasury Department police officers and the public by allowing all the 
officers, including those who work at the Bureau of Engraving and 
Printing (BEP), to carry their government firearms home.
  BEP officers are not allowed to take their government firearms home. 
However, BEP officers can be targets because they wear uniforms to and 
from work. Many BEP officers carry personal firearms to and from work 
because they are not allowed to take their government firearms home, 
and some are forced to leave those personal firearms in their cars 
while they are on duty, creating a possibly dangerous situation.
  Allowing BEP officers to carry their government firearms home will 
put them in the same position as Mint officers. Although both agencies 
are under the Treasury Department under Treasury Department rules, Mint 
officers are allowed to carry their government firearms home, while BEP 
officers are not. There is no meaningful distinction between officers 
for these two agencies. They should be treated equally.
  This bill would allow all police officers in the Treasury Department 
to carry their government firearms home to protect officers and the 
public, eliminating separate carrying rules for the Treasury 
Department&#x27;s different law enforcement agencies.
  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

     SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF WILLARD&#x27;S SESQUICENTENNIAL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT E. LATTA

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 30, 2024

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the City of 
Willard&#x27;s Sesquicentennial. The perseverance of pioneers and settlers 
to overcome the challenges faced during the early years of the city&#x27;s 
history has persisted throughout the past 150 years. The hard work and 
spirit shown by generations of city residents have made Willard an 
outstanding example of American ingenuity.
  In 1874, the City of Willard was established as a community and a 
junction for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s line to Sandusky and the 
branch west to Chicago. The original name of Willard was Chicago, 
however, passengers would mistake the community for Chicago, Illinois. 
The city&#x27;s name was changed to Chicago Junction, but the word 
``junction&#x27;&#x27; did not fit on name boards at the time. In 1917, the town 
changed its name to Willard, after the then president of the Baltimore 
and Ohio Railroad, Daniel Willard. In 1960, Willard officially became 
the city&#x27;s name. The city is an asset to the great State of Ohio 
through its many contributions in the fields of manufacturing and 
agriculture. It remains to this day a key junction for the rail company 
CSX Transportation.
  Mr. Speaker, by remembering the 150th Anniversary of the City of 
Willard, community members recognize the outstanding achievements, 
maintain the pioneer attitude, and strive to better their city through 
the principles on which it was founded. I thank and congratulate 
Willard on this significant milestone.
