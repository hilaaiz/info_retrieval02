                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 12, 2023

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am pleased to speak on 
the importance of Hispanic Heritage Month (HHM).
  American society today embraces a remarkable breadth of cultures, and 
Hispanics are an integral part of this diversity.
  The Hispanic American community is a beautiful array of distinct 
groups, including people with roots in Central and South America, 
including our neighbors in Mexico and the Caribbean, and Spain.
  In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson designated a National Hispanic 
Heritage Week because of the growing impact of the Latin American 
culture in shaping the Nation and society.
  The week was expanded in 1988 to a 31-day period by President Reagan 
to provide all Americans the opportunity to participate and commemorate 
the important contributions of the Hispanic culture to mainstream 
America.
  Today in communities across the Nation millions of American families 
come together to celebrate in this facet of American culture and 
participate in traditional comidas and fiestas.
  There are over 63.7 million Hispanics living in the U.S. and 
Hispanics continue to be the fastest growing ethnic group.
  In Harris County, Texas there are 43.1 percent Hispanic, 
approximately 2.02 million people.
  In 2022, 44.5 percent of the Houston population identified as 
Hispanic or Latino in the Census.
  Not only is this a month to celebrate Hispanic culture and 
traditions, but it is also a time to reunite and celebrate the 
importance of keeping traditions alive through family gatherings and 
fiestas.
  Yet, in the time we currently live in many families are separated 
from one another.
  While we must acknowledge the challenges at our border, we should 
never forget that behind the statistics given to us are real families, 
real children, and real people in desperate need.
  One of my own staffers, Amy Arceo, had her grandmother rejected USA 
entry and banned for 10 years due to crossing the border from Mexico, 
when all she wanted to do was to see her family and return home.
  After those 10 long years and an additional 3 years to work her way 
through our immigration system, her grandmother Ma. Esperanza Bugarin 
was finally able to receive her papers to re-enter the USA.
  Her family has been reunited after 13 long years of being separated 
from one another, the ban having forced her to miss many important 
family events.
  During this month, let us reaffirm our commitment to promoting 
diversity, equity, inclusion, and most importantly unity.
  It is essential that we continue working together to break down 
barriers and ensure that all Americans, regardless of their background, 
have equal access to opportunities and the chance to achieve their 
dreams.
  On behalf of my constituents and in my duties as a U.S. 
Representative, I am committed to speaking up for the rights of 
Hispanics and confronting the issues that affect them.
  From lowering the uninsured healthcare rates and fighting to make 
higher education more affordable, to championing an increase in the 
minimum wage and addressing the economic challenges facing working 
women and families, my colleagues and I will continue working for the 
Latino community&#x27;s top priorities.
  Devoted to family, faith, country, and hard work, Hispanic Americans 
bring unique and bountiful perspectives and experiences to our national 
community and character.
  The vibrant Hispanic influence can be seen in all aspects of American 
life and culture, and especially in Houston, Harris County and Texas, 
and from distinctive cuisine to colorful festivals, and from the 
rhythms and melodies of traditional music to the contagious beat of 
today&#x27;s most popular songs.
  The Hispanic community has persevered in the face of discrimination 
and hardships.
  While significant barriers still stand in our way, I will continue 
fighting with a strong commitment to achieve comprehensive immigration 
reform and to support an inclusive and unified country.

HONORING CHIEF GARY GACEK OF CONCORD, NORTH CAROLINA FOR HIS MANY YEARS 
                          OF DEDICATED SERVICE

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 12, 2023

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Chief Gary Gacek on his retirement from the Concord Police 
Department and to honor his many years of faithful service to the 
people of Concord, North Carolina.
  Gacek began his career in law enforcement with the Milwaukee Police 
Department. where he served in a variety of roles over the course of 25 
years. He began his role as Chief of Police of the Concord Police 
Department in July 2015. Under his leadership, Concord became one of 
the safest cities in the state, with crime

[[Page E964]]

rates hitting their lowest levels in over twenty years.
  Gacek implemented numerous reforms and initiatives that helped 
modernize the department, reduce crime and develop the community. Some 
of these reforms include the implementation of an evidence-based 
community policing strategy. updating the department&#x27;s technology and 
information systems, expanding the department&#x27;s analytical and 
intelligence capabilities. and developing several community engagement 
initiatives, among many others. Perhaps one of his greatest initiatives 
was the creation of the Concord Police Foundation, which supports 
Concord Police Department employees and their families and helps make 
Concord a safer community to live and work. Gacek established this 
program in 2021 in honor of Concord Officer Jason Shuping who was 
tragically killed in the line of duty on December 16, 2020.
  I have known Chief Gacek for many years and witnessed firsthand the 
tremendous work he has done for the people of Concord. I am proud to 
call him my friend and know I speak for the whole community when I wish 
him well in this next chapter of his life.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, please join me today in congratulating Gary 
Gacek on his retirement and to thank him for his many years of 
dedicated service.

                         HONORING SUZANNE SMITH

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 12, 2023

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today, 
along with my colleague, Rep. Jared Huffman, to honor Suzanne Smith for 
her dedicated service to the Sonoma County Transportation Authority and 
Regional Climate Protection Authority where she worked to build both 
agencies from the ground up.
  Ms. Smith received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science 
from the University of California, San Diego, where she also studied 
urban planning. Suzanne would later receive her Master of Arts degree 
in Public Administration from the University of San Francisco.
  The Sonoma County Transit Authority (SCTA) and the Regional Climate 
Protection Authority (RCPA) represent Sonoma County and the area&#x27;s nine 
cities. They work together to balance the interests of each local 
government while spearheading transit projects, and climate protection 
initiatives. Ms. Smith was hired as the SCTA&#x27;s first independent 
executive director in 1997 and later was assigned to lead RCPA as well. 
Since then, she has grown the team to sixteen curated employees, and 
worked tirelessly to implement crucial transportation and climate 
projects and programs in Sonoma County and the North Bay.
  Ms. Smith led the organizational process that created the Measure M 
Traffic Relief Act (Measure M). She worked to include it on the 2004 
ballot and to ensure it passed. This quarter cent sales tax has been 
successfully used to improve transportation, transit, safety, and the 
widening of Highway 101 for carpool lanes. In addition, she oversaw 
long range planning, and collaborated with partner agencies and the 
public on policy priorities. Additionally, she was instrumental in the 
founding legislation for Sonoma Marin Area Rail Transit District 
(SMART) and the Sonoma County Regional Climate Protection Authority.
  In 1997, Ms. Smith had three goals: to get a sales tax measure passed 
to support transportation, widen Highway 101, and establish train 
service. She not only accomplished her goals, but she has also acted as 
an incredible leader for the community of Sonoma County. She has made 
and maintained effective partnerships with agencies and elected 
officials nationwide and has directed the Sonoma County Transit 
Authority and Regional Climate Protection Authority through economic 
downturns and the COVID-19 pandemic. She has served with integrity, 
foresight, thoughtfulness, and unquestionable dedication and 
commitment. Ms. Smith demonstrated exceptional interpersonal skills and 
an innate understanding of how politics work and how to move projects 
forward.
  Throughout her professional career, Ms. Smith also served as the 
district director for State Assembly Member Valerie Brown. She worked 
on policy issues such as transportation, education, and local 
government.

[[Page E963]]

  Ms. Smith is revered by her colleagues not just for her work but also 
for her friendliness and collegiality. When she is not working, she 
also loves to spend time with her family including her husband, Tim, 
her mom, Barbara, her stepchildren, Katie Mason, Nick Smith, and Emily 
Angelopoulos, and her grandchildren, Cam, Nick, Sidney, Ben, Anthony, 
and Dominic.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is therefore fitting and proper that we 
recognize Suzanne Smith for her longtime service at the Sonoma County 
Transit Authority and Regional Climate Protection Authority.

contributions of Dr. Melvinia King as she is honored as one of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year. As the

the organization&#x27;s drive to alleviate and eliminate poverty and 
substance abuse amongst youth in Solano County. Since joining the 
organization in 2018, she has spearheaded an agenda rooted in Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr.&#x27;s vision of ``Creating the Beloved Community,&#x27;&#x27; 
addressing the complex issues of poverty and racism while 
simultaneously empowering families and nurturing the potential of our 
youth. Beyond this important work, Melvinia serves on several local 
committees, including the Solano County Workforce Development Board, 
Black Infant Healthcare Advisory Board, and Solano County Home Visiting 
Community Advisory Board. She is known by her colleagues as not only a 
strong advocate for change, but also an active contributor to it. Her 
work has created a lasting legacy that will touch the lives of 
countless individuals throughout our district. On behalf of the people 
of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor 
and recognize Dr. Melvinia King for her positive contributions to our

                       Thursday, October 12, 2023

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this past 
weekend, I was grateful to participate with the U.S. Delegation for the 
NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Copenhagen, Denmark, led by Delegation 
Chairman Mike Turner and Assembly former President Gerry Connolly.
  On Friday, the focus was on war criminal Putin&#x27;s murderous invasion 
of Ukraine. NATO and the European Union have surpassed America with aid 
for Ukraine and incredibly Finland is now a NATO member with an 830-
mile border with Russia, as Sweden gives up 200 years of neutrality to 
stop dictators. The West is united as never before in history to 
protect democracies.
  On Saturday, with the sadistic invasion of Israel, there was 
extraordinary unanimity supporting Israel&#x27;s territorial integrity. 
Clearly the axis of dictatorships of Putin, the regime in Tehran, and 
the Chinese Communist Party, had collaborated again with the invasion 
from Gaza. Sadly, the war we did not choose, Dictatorship with Rule of 
Gun against Democracies with Rule of Law, is proceeding and must be 
faced with Peace Through Strength.
  On Sunday, Resolutions were presented from the five standing 
committees with amendments to be considered with debate. 
Parliamentarian Michal Szczerba of Poland presented Towards 
Reconstruction of Ukraine emphasizing payment by seized Russia assets, 
while Parliamentarian Njall Fridbertsson of Iceland explained 
Enhancement of Protection of allied critical maritime infrastructure.
  Senator Rodrigue Demeuse of Belgium proposed the resolution on 
Protecting Allied Democracies from Disinformation with provisions for 
addressing war crimes. Assemblyman Utku Cakirozer of Turkiye explained 
implementing NATO&#x27;s new Deterrence and Defense Baseline. It is crucial 
we continue to stand with Turkiye as it is attacked by terrorists, just 
as we defeat the barbarian terrorists of Gaza. MP Alec Shelbrooke of 
Britain presented a Resolution Strengthening Stability and Security to 
the Black Sea Region following Russia&#x27;s invasion, emphasizing grain 
deliveries for Egypt and African countries which are being destroyed by 
war criminal Putin.
  On Monday, unanimously provided statements were issued supporting 
Israel as Iran&#x27;s chants of Death to Israel, Death to America unfolded. 
Resolutions previously presented unanimously of 27 countries present 
were inspiring for the courageous citizens of Ukraine and Israel. There 
was unprecedented solidarity for freedom, democracy, and rule of law.
  Stirring addresses were made of determined support for Ukraine and 
Israel for territorial integrity by NATO Parliamentary Assembly 
President Michal Szczerba, Danish Parliamentary Speaker Soren Gade 
compared the Hamas attack to 9/11 and Pearl Harbor, Danish Prime 
Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed concern that many are naive as to 
Russia and China, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised 
Israel&#x27;s resolve and thanked all for help to Ukraine, Deputy Secretary 
General of NATO Mircea Geoana cited Europeans killed by Iran proxy 
Hamas in Israel, with NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation 
General Philippe Lavigne emphasizing importance of all countries to 
reach two percent for defense to achieve Peace Through Peace.
  The sessions concluded with presenting the 2023 `Women for Peace and 
Security&#x27; award to Leader of Democratic Belarus Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya who courageously works for a democratic Belarus and 
political prisoner release including her husband.

During his time in the Scouts, Noah has participated in countless 
fundraising and community service activities along with many different 
camping and hiking adventures. In July of 2022, Noah completed a 60-
mile Trek at Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico where he 
achieved the Boy Scout 50 miler award. For his Eagle Scout Project, he 
built benches, a water station, and rehabilitated a pavilion for use by 
spectators at cycling events put on by Camp Edge in Alloway, South 
Jersey. His remains active in the scouts with his current position of 
Junior Assistant Scoutmaster at Troop 60 in Daretown, South Jersey. 
Noah is now a junior at Woodstown High School, consistently earning his 
way on to the

Honor Roll. Outside of scouting, he is an athlete on his school&#x27;s 
Varsity Track and Field team and a volunteer at his church, all while 
maintaining a job at a local farm. Along with his Eagle Scout award, 
Noah will be presented with the Bronze and Gold palms for his 
remarkable leadership and his willingness to accept responsibility. I 
am incredibly proud of Noah for all his accomplishments in the Scouts 
and I know he has a bright future ahead of him. God Bless Noah and God 
Bless the United States of America.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I celebrate the 
accomplishments of Noah Wertzberger and his recent achievement of the 
rank of Eagle Scout. Noah embarked on his scouting journey as a K-cub 
during his kindergarten years. Throughout his scouting experience, he 
remained actively involved and just recently completed his Eagle 
Project in October. His project involved the removal of two Osprey 
nests situated on the Great Egg Harbor Watershed. Once those were 
removed, he constructed and installed replacement Osprey Nests with the 
help of the Great Egg Harbor Watershed Association. Noah is extremely 
grateful for Troop Seventy-Nine and the Boy Scouts for imparting 
invaluable lessons and fostering friendships. After achieving the 
prestigious rank of Eagle Scout, he now serves as an assistant 
scoutmaster, providing ongoing assistance to the Troop. In the upcoming 
fall, he will be attending Seton Hall University. Noah should be 
incredibly proud of his accomplishments, and I know he has a bright 
future ahead of him. God Bless Noah Wertzberger and God Bless the 
United States of America.

            RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DANIELLE ``DANI&#x27;&#x27; DUGGAN

                                 ______

                       Thursday, October 12, 2023

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in honor of the 
life of Danielle ``Dani&#x27;&#x27; Duggan.
  Born on May 7, 1966, Dani was raised in Middleborough, Massachusetts, 
where she found a passion for the arts at a young age. After graduating 
as an honors student from Middleborough High School in 1984, Dani went 
on to study at St. Michael&#x27;s College, where she received an honors 
Bachelor of Arts degree in fine arts and theatre and was the recipient 
of the Delta Epsilon Sigma Society Departmental Award for outstanding 
achievement in fine arts.
  Dani then moved to Dublin, Ireland to work for the famous Abbey 
Theatre. This is where she also met her husband, Gerry Clements. She 
lived in Ireland for eight years receiving an honors master&#x27;s degree in 
modern drama from University College Dublin and would later form the 
Salem Willows Theatre Company.
  Dani returned to the U.S. with her husband, Gerry, moving to 
Pembroke, Massachusetts, and over the next 24 years, she taught drama 
at Middleborough High School. During her time at MHS, she became chair 
of the fine arts department and played a pivotal role in the design and 
construction of the new Middleborough High School Performing Arts 
Center and Blackbox Theatre. At MHS, Dani directed numerous school 
productions and the speech &amp; theater workshop, as well as several 
productions with the Plymouth Community Theatre.
  Sadly, Dani left us too soon on October 15, 2022, after a two year 
battle with cancer. Whether during her time at Middleborough High 
School or her work with the Abbey Theatre, Dani&#x27;s passion for sharing 
her love for the arts serves as an example to all. Throughout her years 
at Middleborough High School, Dani laid the groundwork for the school 
district to hold an annual event celebrating students&#x27; work in the fine 
arts. On May 20, 2023, Middleborough held its inaugural Dani Duggan 
Fine Arts Festival to honor Dani&#x27;s legacy.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to honor the life of Dani Duggan. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing her life&#x27;s commitment 
to serving her community through the arts.

  RECOGNIZING THE WILSON FAMILY&#x27;S FARM, COTTON HILLS FARM IN LOWRYS, 
                             SOUTH CAROLINA

                                 ______

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 12, 2023

  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognzie the 
outstanding work of the Wilson Family in Lowrys, South Carolina and 
their dedication to providing locally grown produce for over 140 years.
  Cotton Hills Farm was given to Joseph Wilson and Theodosia Abel as a 
wedding gift by the bride&#x27;s father in 1880. It has been passed down 
multiple generations and is now run by JEB Wilson along with his 
brother, Pete, and his father, Jeff.
  For 100 years, cotton had been the primary crop planted on Cotton 
Hills Farm. Starting in the 1940s, JEB&#x27;s grandfather started planting 
peaches as well. Today, the family farm has expanded to pumpkins, 
peaches, watermelon, and cantaloupe. JEB Wilson has proudly said, 
``basically anything that can be grown in South Carolina, we grow it.&#x27;&#x27; 
The family also operates three retail locations in Chester County, 
South Carolina and sells wholesale produce.
  Conservation and sustainability have been a key element to the long-
term success of Cotton Hills Farm. The Wilson family is constantly 
looking for ways to improve the farm and keep it sustainable for years 
to come.
  I would like to recognize that the entire family is also very 
accomplished in their community. Jeff is a long-serving member of the 
Soil and Water Conservation District in Chester County and currently 
serving as the vice chairman. Additionally, JEB and Pete have been 
named Conservationist of the Year in Chester County. JEB credits the 
family&#x27;s success to their adaptability to challenges and willingness to 
try new farming methods that will continue to decrease their 
environmental impact.
  The Wilson family continues to be devoted to their farm and are 
looking forward to passing it down the family line. On behalf of the 
5th District of South Carolina, it is my most sincere pleasure to 
recognize Cotton Hills Farm and the Wilson family for their great 
service to our state. Please join me in recognizing the farm on its 
advancements in agricultural innovation and conservation.
