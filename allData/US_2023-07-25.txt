    EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS SUPPORTING THE STATE OF ISRAEL

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 18, 2023

  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this 
resolution expressing the sense of Congress Supporting the State of 
Israel.
  As the only vibrant, progressive, and inclusive democracy in the 
Middle East, Israel is a beacon of hope--a country where pluralism 
flourishes. Efforts to delegitimize the Jewish State and claims that 
the country has abandoned the democratic principles on which it was 
founded are unfair and false. In Israel, Arab parties serve in the 
Knesset, women serve at the highest levels of the military, and the 
country remains an oasis for LGBTQ+ people in a region hostile toward 
the community.
  The U.S.-Israel alliance is strong for a reason. Our nations were 
founded on these shared values, and those ideals keep our partnership 
ironclad to this day.
  Israeli security is critical to America&#x27;s national security. Our 
bilateral defense and intelligence cooperation makes our two countries 
safer and plays a key role in the global fight against terror, I am 
proud to champion this relationship in Congress. We have no better 
partner in the region than the State of Israel and I will remain 
committed to ensuring that Israel has the resources it needs to defend 
itself.
  I have traveled to Israel twice this year alone, alongside Democrats 
and Republicans, and have many times visited the country to meet with 
senior level officials and civil society leaders. Each time I am 
reminded of the resolve and passion of the Israeli people. I am also 
reminded of the importance of the Jewish State.
  The United States was the first country to recognize Israel&#x27;s 
independence 75 years ago, just eleven minutes after its founding. It 
has since become the ``Start Up Nation&#x27;&#x27;, a leader in high-tech, 
sustainability, and innovation. The United States has stood with Israel 
every step of the way.
  Over the last 75 years, bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel 
relationship has proven vital to protecting our national security, 
fighting terror, and intelligence collaboration.
  I look forward to celebrating Israel&#x27;s next 75 years, and furthering 
the vital U.S.-Israel relationship.

                          ____________________

      HONORING THE VASILOFF FAMILY FOR THEIR DEVOTION TO VETERANS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 25, 2023

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor a Livingston County, 
Michigan, family that has quietly, and without fanfare, devoted 
themselves over the past decade to the service of their community, 
their Nation, and veterans in need.
  Kathy and Steve Vasiloff of Green Oak Township have long enjoyed 
throwing parties in their lakeside home, making their backyard a 
popular gathering place for friends, family, and neighbors. But when 
their son David joined the United States Marine Corps in 2007, those 
parties took on a different tone: sending him off and welcoming him 
home from training, and then from multiple deployments to Iraq and 
Afghanistan.
  Hit twice by improvised explosive devices during his tours of duty, 
David came home in 2011 a changed man, and as a result, his family 
changed direction as well. Seeking to honor their son&#x27;s service, and 
the stories he told of his brothers and sisters in arms, many of whom 
did not come home, the Vasiloff family decided to combine their love of 
throwing parties with a purpose. Ten years ago they opened up their 
home for a summer soiree, this time asking for donations for wounded 
veterans, and raised an impressive $3,000 in one evening. The next 
summer, the party grew, and so did the funds raised. And so a tradition 
was born, one that has blossomed into an annual extravaganza featuring 
live music, raffles, gift baskets, hundreds of attendees, and tens of 
thousands of dollars in donations for the Fallen and Wounded Soldiers 
Fund, a Michigan non-profit supporting injured servicemen and the 
families of heroes in our state. In fact, over the decade the Vasiloff 
family has been holding these fundraisers, they&#x27;ve become the largest 
private donors to the organization, with total donations closing in on 
$200,000.
  Planning and holding a fundraiser of this magnitude is a huge team 
effort, and a major undertaking for the Vasiloffs. As such, the 
Vasiloff family has decided that 2023 will be their final event. But it 
certainly won&#x27;t be the end of their service. David, the proud Marine 
who helped inspire the fundraisers, continues to inspire, serve, and 
protect his hometown community of Green Oak Township, where he is now a 
police officer. And Kathy and Steve will never stop supporting the 
brave men and women like their son who come home with visible and 
invisible scars of war, as well as the service families whose lives are 
forever shattered by loss.
  Service to one&#x27;s country takes many forms, and that includes 
contributing to our collective goal of moving toward a more perfect 
union. Mr. Speaker, the Vasiloff family has never sought praise or 
publicity for their efforts, instead directing all attention to the 
cause so close to their hearts. But as they prepare for their tenth and 
final summer event, I thank them for their faithful service.

                          ____________________

        MOUNT SALEM AMERICAN BAPTIST CHURCH CELEBRATES 151 YEARS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL CLOUD

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 25, 2023

  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mount Salem 
American Baptist Church on its remarkable 151st anniversary this year. 
This amazing milestone is a true testament to God&#x27;s grace toward his 
people, as well as the unwavering faith, fellowship, and dedication of 
the congregation and its leaders throughout the years.
  Founded in 1872, the church began in Indianola as the Mount Salem 
American Baptist Free Mission Church. Soon after its founding, the 
church was sadly hit by 2 major hurricanes in 1875 and 1886, destroying 
the church&#x27;s building. Yet with faith in God&#x27;s providence, the 
congregation endured and continued the ministry. Led by Reverend Robert 
Greer, 20 church members moved to Victoria, bringing with them the 
pulpit, bell, and some of the salvaged lumber from the original church 
building to start anew--where the congregation reestablished and 
pressed forward in the mission. With that perseverance came God&#x27;s 
guidance and blessing. The church continued to grow over the years and 
was eventually renamed as Mount Salem American Baptist Church in 1939. 
In 1962, the church moved to another new building, where they still 
prominently display the original bell and pulpit used by the founding 
members.
  To this day, Mount Salem American Baptist Church has touched 
countless lives in the Victoria community through its selfless acts of 
service. Through outreach programs, compassionate ministries, and 
social initiatives, the church has been a steadfast advocate for the 
greater community, serving their neighbors for over a century.
  But more than any building, program, or person, Mount Salem&#x27;s 
anniversary milestone is a testament to God&#x27;s enduring faithfulness 
toward his people. Through both triumph and trial, it is clear that the 
Lord has provided the path and made clear His purpose.
  Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Mount Salem American Baptist Church 
on this incredible day. May God continue to bless and keep them in the 
days and years ahead.

                          ____________________

truly exemplary. Throughout his tenure as President, he has displayed

commitment to fostering a positive work environment and promoting the 
well-being of Wakefern employees is truly commendable.

                         Tuesday, July 25, 2023

  Mr. GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
retirement and commend the service of Officer James Hutchins, who has 
honorably served with the Los Angeles Police Department for 35 years. 
For nearly his entire life, Officer Hutchins has consistently and 
bravely put his life on the line in service of our Nation and in 
defense of our communities, and is now taking his well-deserved 
retirement to spend time with his loving family.
  Officer Hutchins first began his career of service by enlisting in 
the United States Army in 1984. Serving for 4 years, he received an 
honorable discharge as an Airborne Ranger. It was at this time, in 1988 
that he graduated from the LAPD Training Academy and joined the force, 
accruing time and experience in the Van Nuys, Pacific, and Venice Beach 
divisions.
  By 1995, Officer Hutchins became a Los Angeles motorcycle officer 
assigned to the Central Traffic Division, and quickly set himself apart 
for his dedication and professionalism. Upon returning to the Valley 
Traffic Division later that year, Officer Hutchins became a mentor to 
his fellow motorcycle officers, a legacy carried until his retirement 
as ``Most Senior Motor Cop in the City&#x27;&#x27;, He additionally earned a 
Police Star in 2005 for bravely evacuating Los Angeles residents during 
a catastrophic fire. This commendation was just one of over 200 
accolades accrued over the course of his 35 years of service, marking 
his end of watch in June 2023.
  I cannot commend Officer Hutchins enough for his service to 
California&#x27;s 27th Congressional District and the City of Los Angeles. 
We thank him for his tireless work to keep our community safe, and wish 
him the best in his retirement and the opportunity to spend more time 
with friends and loved ones, as is certainly deserved after such a long 
and successful career.

 RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MORSE MANUFACTURING COMPANY, INC.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 25, 2023

  Mr. WILLIAMS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Morse 
Manufacturing Company, Inc. as it celebrates its 100th Anniversary this 
year.
  Morse Manufacturing was incorporated on August 15, 1923. It was first 
located at 402 S. Franklin Street in the City of Syracuse, New York, 
and then quickly relocated to Dickerson Street. Ralph Andrews joined 
Morse Manufacturing in 1943, developed a product to safely handle 
drums, and purchased the company from the founder in 1948. In 1953 the 
company was moved to East Syracuse.
  Robert Andrews, son of Ralph Andrews, joined Morse Manufacturing in 
1969. Robert continued to grow and enhance a product offering to safely 
handle drums that was initiated by his father, and also expanded the 
building several times at the East Syracuse location.
  Nathan Andrews, grandson of Ralph Andrews, joined Morse Manufacturing 
in 2002 and continued the family tradition of commitment and dedication 
through developing new international distribution and modernizing the 
operations at a new facility in the Town of Salina in 2019.
  Today, Morse Manufacturing offers the most extensive line of high-
quality drum handling equipment anywhere in the world and markets its 
products through an elite worldwide dealer network. The longstanding 
success of Morse Manufacturing is largely because of the quality of its 
employees. It has provided hundreds of employees and their families 
with careers and job security over its history. Morse Manufacturing and 
its employees have continued to give back to the Central New York 
Community through volunteer work and contributions.
  Morse Manufacturing takes pride in sourcing as much as possible from 
local suppliers with long established relationships. This makes Morse 
Manufacturing a net revenue generator for the Central New York Economy, 
bringing revenues from products sold around the country and world to 
spend locally through wages, taxes, and local suppliers.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 22nd Congressional District, I would like to 
congratulate Morse Manufacturing on the occasion of its 100th 
Anniversary. I wish them continued success for many years to come.

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the 100th 
Anniversary of the Marine Corps League. The Congressionally Chartered 
Veteran Service Organization over the past century has been critical in 
the care and welfare of our military, its Veterans, and their families.
  The Marine Corps League was established in 1923 by World War I hero, 
then Commandant of the Marine Corps Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune. On 
August 4, 1937, it was Congressionally Chartered by the 75th Congress 
of the United States and signed and approved by President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt.
  The Marine Corps League provides millions of hours annually in 
service to the community, represents thousands of Veterans in cases 
with the Department of Veterans Affairs, performs tens of thousands of 
funeral honors annually for our passing Veterans, and provides millions 
of toys to the youth of America through the Toys for Tots Foundation 
and Marine Corps Reserves. This volunteer work directly and positively 
impacts force readiness for the Marine Corps Reserves allowing 
additional focus on training and preparation.
  As a retired Lt. General and the former Commander of the U.S. Marine 
Corps Reserves and Marine Forces North, I deeply understand the 
importance of strong and battle-ready reserve units and will continue 
to support their mission here in Congress. The work of the Marine Corps 
League and the impact of their advocacy on behalf of our 
servicemembers, Veterans, and their families cannot be overstated.
  It is an honor to recognize the Marine Corps League for 100 years of 
service to our country. I look forward to assisting in fulfilling their 
mission to support our Servicemen and women. Please join me in 
congratulating the Marine Corps League for this historic achievement.

                          ____________________

    RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE YOUGHIOGHENY RIVER LAKE

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 25, 2023

  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the 
Youghiogheny River Lake on its 75th anniversary. Located in 
Pennsylvania&#x27;s Fayette and Somerset Counties, the lake provides flood 
protection for the upper Ohio River and the Youghiogheny and lower 
Monongahela River Valleys.
  The flood control reservoir was authorized by the Flood Control Act 
of 1938. Since its completion in 1943, the dam is estimated to have 
saved more than $569 million by preventing upstream flood damage.
  The benefits of the Youghiogheny River Lake don&#x27;t stop there. 
Alongside its support staff, the lake also alleviates pollution, 
improves water quality, and enhances the navigability of nearby rivers. 
A hydroelectric plant along the dam generates enough power for 
approximately 8,000 homes per year.
  Visitors can camp, fish, swim, picnic, and boat on the Youghiogheny 
River Lake. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission regularly stocks 
the lake with trout and operates a boat launch along the shoreline. The 
Youghiogheny Outflow Campground offers a nearby camping experience that 
allows even more visitors to enjoy the lake&#x27;s beautiful scenery and 
recreational opportunities.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 14th 
Congressional District, I congratulate the Youghiogheny River Lake on 
its 75th anniversary. I thank the staff, volunteers, and community 
members who support

the lake&#x27;s success, and I look forward to seeing their continued 
dedication to the community over the next 75 years.
