                 CELEBRATING 90 YEARS OF RUTT INSURANCE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 20, 2025

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize 
Rutt Insurance for their 90th anniversary.
  Founded in May 1935 by B. Titus Rutt, an orchard manager-turned-
insurance salesman. Rutt Insurance is a family-run independent 
insurance company located on Main Street in Mount Joy, Pennsylvania. 
Since Jamie Rutt, Titus&#x27;s grandson, joined the business in 1991, the 
company has nearly doubled in size and expanded its reach by acquiring 
other small agencies.
  Rutt Insurance continues to serve the people of Lancaster County with 
integrity, helping individuals and businesses find the right coverage 
for their homes, vehicles, and livelihoods. As proud members of the 
Keystone Insurers Group and the Mount Joy Chamber of Commerce, their 
contributions extend beyond business--they are active participants in 
building a stronger, more resilient community.
  As Rutt Insurance celebrates a milestone anniversary and prepares the 
next generation of Rutt family leadership, I commend Rutt Insurance for 
90 years of hard work, service, and positive community impact. The 
American Dream is alive in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 11th Congressional District, 
and Rutt Insurance demonstrates that. May their success continue for 
many more years to come.

                          ____________________

               CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT-ELECT NICUSOR DAN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 20, 2025

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the American people extend 
their congratulations to President-Elect Nicusor Dan on decisively 
winning the runoff election, as an independent, to become the President 
of Romania held on May 18, 2025.
  The President-elect&#x27;s political career as the leader of the Save 
Romania Union (USR) party began in 2016, during his service in the 
Romanian Chamber of Deputies, then in 2020, went on to become the Mayor 
of Bucharest.
  His strong priorities of strengthening cooperation with the United 
States and the European Union demonstrates his suitability to be the 
right leader for the people of Romania. I have a personal appreciation 
for Romania with visits since 1997 where Cluj-Napoca was adopted as 
sister city of Columbia, South Carolina. I have visited numerous parts 
of the country with troops from South Carolina stationed at NATO 
facilities enduring the warm friendship of Americans for Romanians.
  There is a deep appreciation for President-Elect Dan and his 
commitment to promoting both academic and civil engagement in Romania, 
which dates back to his co-founding of the Scoala Normala Superioara 
Bucuresti, in 2001, modeled after the French Ecole Normale Superieure. 
Aiming to cultivate academic excellence in Romania, his commitment to 
furthering academic excellence in Romania, combined with his efforts to 
eliminate corruption and encourage fiscal reform nationwide, cements 
the strong policy foundation he will take with him as he enters office.
  My appreciation for the people of Romania is personal as I have seen 
firsthand how they have flourished since being liberated from the 
tyranny of the failed Soviet empire. As war criminal Putin attempts to 
rebuild the former Soviet Empire, I am grateful that Romania has taken 
a stand against them, siding with the democratic Rule of Law, which 
will always triumph over the authoritarian Rule of Gun.
  We cannot allow war criminal Putin to rebuild the failed former 
Soviet empire and nations like Romania will help us maintain Peace 
Through Strength across Europe and the rest of the world.
  This election is a powerful testament to democratic resilience in the 
face of neighboring warfare and criminal electoral manipulation.
  Romania continues to be a strong local supporter of the people of 
Ukraine in their struggle against the illegal invasion of woke war 
criminal Putin. I am eager for the United States to work with 
President-Elect Dan. In November of last year, Romania almost fell into 
the Russian sphere of influence, again, as the Kremlin instructed 
domestic actors to influence the first round of elections, which would 
have led to the rise of the Anti-American far-right.
  Thankfully, the Constitutional Court of Romania upheld the Rule of 
Law and ordered the election to be held once more with more integrity 
safeguards to be put into place. I commend the Court for ensuring that 
malign foreign influence, particularly from Russia, does

[[Page E457]]

not determine leadership in a reliable and important democratic ally to 
the United States.
  The Kremlin&#x27;s attempts to subvert Romania&#x27;s democracy are part of a 
broader campaign to weaken transatlantic cohesion. The United States 
unequivocally condemns these actions and supports coordinated sanctions 
and countermeasures to counter these criminal maneuvers.
  I look forward to President-Elect Dan being sworn-in during the 
coming weeks. The United States is proud to stand with the President-
Elect as a vital NATO ally and a democratic anchor on NATO&#x27;s eastern 
flank.
  Romania&#x27;s electoral course correction can serve as a blueprint for 
othel democracies under pressure from Russian tyranny, from Georgia to 
Ukraine. President-elect Dan&#x27;s victory reaffirms that the democratic 
spirit cannot be extinguished by external sabotage or internal 
division. We wish him the best as he enters office and forms a 
government and counters the moves by our common enemy.
  Mr. Speaker, the United States wishes President-Elect Dan a warm 
congratulations and best of luck, or felicitari si mult noroc.

                          ____________________

  Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Willie 
J. Trueitt, Jr. of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in recognition of his 
impending retirement.
  Sergeant Trueitt serves as the lead for Special Operations and 
Community Engagement with the University of Tennessee--Chattanooga 
Police Department. He has held positions in law enforcement for 31 
years, including seven years with the Chattanooga Police Department, 
five years with the U.S. Veterans Affairs Police, and more than 19 
years with the UTC Police Department.
  Sergeant Trueitt also served our Nation in the United States Navy. In 
his eleven years of service, then-Petty Officer Trueitt served in duty 
stations including Scotland and Norfolk, Virginia.
  I had the pleasure of meeting Sergeant Trueitt when he served in the 
security detail for my visits to the UTC campus, and he also oversaw 
the security planning for my Service Academy Day event this year. He 
has committed himself to serving the campus community, displaying a 
high level of professionalism while also bringing a bright smile and a 
positive attitude to his work.
  It is with gratitude that I recognize Sergeant Willie J. Trueitt, 
Jr., for his 42 years of public service to our Nation and our 
community, and I wish him well on his retirement.

 RECOGNIZING DR. ALISA WHITE, PRESIDENT OF SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MORGAN LUTTRELL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 20, 2025

  Mr. LUTTRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize President Alisa 
White of Sam Houston State University for her dedication, devotion and 
leadership in service to Sam Houston State University, its students and 
all Texans. Like Sam Houston himself, Dr. White saw Texas as a land of 
promise, offering opportunities for bold enterprise and she is 
delivering on that promise every day.
  Assuming the role as President of SHSU in August of 2020, Dr. White 
brought her leadership to the University in a time of disruption, 
change and uncertainty in education. The COVID pandemic had rendered 
the college experience unrecognizable. Finding a way through the 
pandemic, protecting her students and maintaining excellence, President 
White showed true leadership.
  Dr. White is truly committed to Sam Houston&#x27;s first-generation 
college students and those coming to the school from low-income 
households. In every conversation with Dr. White, she speaks of her 
commitment to these students and to giving them the tools they need to 
be successful. This led to the establishment of the First-Generation 
Center to offer tailored resources and support to this cohort of 
students.
  Sam Houston has recently launched the Polytechnic College, known as 
SamPoly. This initiative aims to provide students with practical, 
industry-aligned education to meet the evolving demands of the 
workforce. True to Dr. White&#x27;s mission to provide opportunities for 
students across multiple interests, SamPoly is breaking barriers to 
education and leading to success for an ever-growing range of student 
interests.
  In tune with the needs of the country and the interests of the 
students, President White has thrown her full support behind a new 
commitment to Cyber Studies. Both degreed and certificate level 
programs are growing at Sam Houston and the school is working with the 
CIA, FBI, DHS and other agencies to create a pathway to jobs in this 
fast-growing field.
  Under her leadership, the SHSU College of Osteopathic Medicine is 
making a name for itself in the medical field. Training predominantly 
Primary Care Physicians, they will serve throughout Texas and the U.S. 
in underserved communities. Since Dr. White coming to the helm, the 
medical school secured an investment from the State of Texas for $32 
million and an additional $23 million in pledges and gifts in 2023 
alone.
  It&#x27;s not just in the classroom that Dr. White is making a difference. 
On the fields and courts, and even on the beaches, with the 
introduction of Beach Volleyball this year, Sam Houston students are 
reaching new heights. Dr. White has brought her brand of energy to Sam 
Houston State University and the feeling on campus is electric.
  As a Sam Houston State University graduate, I Could not be prouder to 
offer this commendation to my fellow Bearkat--Dr, Alisa White. Her 
leadership and service to the University and to Texas are unrivaled.

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special 
tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio&#x27;s Fifth Congressional 
District. I am pleased to announce that Lindsey Hatcher of Van Wert, 
Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Military 
Academy in West Point, New York.
  Lindsey&#x27;s offer of appointment permits her to attend the United 
States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029. 
Attending one of our Nation&#x27;s military academies not only offers the 
opportunity to serve our country but also guarantees a world-class 
education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding 
experiences of their lives. Lindsey brings a tremendous amount of 
leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2029. 
While attending Lincolnview High School, she participated in science 
club, band, student government, and was on the honor roll. Throughout 
high school, Lindsey was involved in track and field and golf, earning 
her varsity letter in both. I am confident that she will carry the 
lessons of her student and athletic leadership to the Military Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lindsey 
Hatcher on her offer of appointment to the United States Military 
Academy. Our service academies offer the finest military training and 
education available, and I am positive that Linsdey will excel during 
her career at the Military Academy. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
extending their best wishes to her as she begins her service to our 
Nation.

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
National Roofing Contractors Association headquartered in Itasca, 
Illinois, on the occasion of National Roofing Week between June 1-7, 
2025.
  National Roofing Week honors the efforts of thousands of roofing-

industry&#x27;s commitment to public service in general. National Roofing 
Week is a valuable reminder of the significance quality roofing has on 
every home and business in the U.S.

associations and the voice of professional roofing contractors 
worldwide. NRCA has nearly 4,000 roofing company members representing 
the entire roofing supply chain. Using its network of roofing 
contractors and industry-related members, NRCA is responsible for the 
installation of new construction and replacement roof systems on 
commercial and residential structures in America. Most of NRCA&#x27;s 
members are small, privately held businesses that provide family-
sustaining jobs for thousands of hardworking individuals who are the 
backbone of our economy.
  Professional roofing contractors provide vital services to their 
communities, on and off the clock. NRCA members will recognize National 
Roofing Week June 1-7, by supporting numerous charitable projects, 
employee training programs and other activities across the Nation. I 
commend NRCA and the vital role the organization and its members play 
in every community, and I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging 
their contributions during National Roofing Week.

SUPPORTING THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN&#x27;S CAUCUS ON DEFENDING SNAP AND MEDICAID 
                                  CUTS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 20, 2025

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend Medicaid and the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, from an 
ongoing Republican assault.
  In a few hours Republicans will meet to advance a bill that abandons 
Americans who are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. It guts 
Medicaid, which covers health care for children, people with 
disabilities, seniors, and low-income workers, and it cuts nearly $300 
billion from agriculture and programs that combat hunger, including 
food stamps.
  This Republican bill cuts Medicaid, forcing states to pay more or 
cover fewer people--it cuts benefits.
  I think of the 64,000 people in Connecticut, including 27,000 
children, who can eat thanks to food stamps.
  If this program is pushed back to the states, who have fewer 
resources, the children will go hungry, and their families will not be 
able to afford healthy foods. In this cost of living crisis, the last 
thing we should be doing is making it harder for families to put food 
on the table. But that is exactly what Republicans are preparing to do. 
The results will be devastating--the largest cut to the most successful 
anti-hunger program in American history. All to pay for massive 
giveaways to billionaires.
