              COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF NANCY FAYE CARLOW

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. PAT FALLON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, February 26, 2024

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Mrs. 
Nancy Faye Carlow of Nash, Texas, who peacefully passed away on January 
13, 2024. Mrs. Carlow was a loving wife, mother, and grandmother.
  Mrs. Carlow was born on April 27, 1944, in Maud, Texas, to H.J. 
``Scooter&#x27;&#x27; and Hazel Smith. From a young age, she was known for being 
an academically gifted student. In 1962, Mrs. Carlow graduated from 
Maud High School as the valedictorian. She later received a bachelor&#x27;s 
degree from Stephen F. Austin State University and a master&#x27;s degree 
from East Texas State University. After graduation, Mrs. Carlow briefly 
taught home economics and worked as an elementary school teacher before 
becoming a bookkeeper for Dairyland Farms and Texarkana Tractor.
  Mrs. Carlow was a devoted woman of faith and was a lifetime member of 
the Maud United Methodist Church. While there, she taught Sunday school 
and led the Methodist Youth Fellowship church group for ten years. Mrs. 
Carlow was always a thoughtful woman who sought to put a smile on your 
face. Along with her husband James, she hosted daily happy hours for 
friends and loved ones so they could spend quality time together during 
the pandemic. She also started a weekly tradition of sending flowers to 
others so that they wouldn&#x27;t feel alone. You could always count on her 
to help guide you throughout life and encourage you to do the right 
thing. Mrs. Carlow&#x27;s tragic passing leaves behind a legacy of hard 
work, entrepreneurship, and family values that can never be replaced.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol in recognition of Mrs. Carlow&#x27;s beautiful and uplifting life. 
She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who knew her.

                          ____________________

  INTRODUCTION OF THE PITTMAN-ROBERTSON WILDLIFE RESOTRATION ACT AND 
    DINGELL-JOHNSON SPORT FISH RESTORATION ACT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
                              EQUALITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, February 26, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Pittman-Robertson 
Wildlife Restoration Act and Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act 
District of Columbia Equality Act, which would make the District of 
Columbia eligible for the same federal funding as states under the 
Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson 
Sport Fish Restoration Act. D.C. residents pay full federal taxes and 
therefore D.C. is treated as a state under federal programs, with 
limited exceptions, most of them simply oversights or failures to 
update post-home rule.
  The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act provides funding, 
derived from excise taxes on sporting equipment, for five distinct 
purposes: program administration, wildlife restoration, basic hunter 
education and safety, enhanced hunter education and safety grants,

[[Page E180]]

and multistate conservation grants. D.C. does not receive any funding 
under this Act. The Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act provides 
funding for sport fish restoration, aquatic education, wetlands 
restoration, and boat-related activities. Under this Act, states 
receive a minimum of one percent of the total amount apportioned, while 
D.C. is capped at one-third of one percent.
  This omission and lack of parity under these Acts have serious 
consequences for D.C. D.C. has roughly 7,800 acres of parkland covering 
nearly a quarter of the city, which means it has more parkland per 
capita than any other city in the United States. This bill would define 
``State&#x27;&#x27; in these Acts to include D.C., providing D.C. with equal 
funding for wildlife conservation in our Nation&#x27;s capital.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

 RECOGNIZING MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, TREY WEBSTER, FOR HIS EXCELLENT 
       WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA&#x27;S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEAN PHILLIPS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, February 26, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Legislative 
Director, Raymond ``Trey&#x27;&#x27; Webster III, for his work done on behalf of 
every constituent in Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District. This 
week, Trey will depart my office for new opportunities with Rep. Susie 
Lee as her Legislative Director, and I could not be prouder or more 
grateful for his service.
  As Legislative Director, Trey brought an incredible work ethic and 
commitment to his job, earning his spot as an honorary Minnesotan in 
the process. He led our legislative team with intelligence, humor, and 
compassion, and we will miss him greatly as he embarks on his new 
adventure.
  A University of South Carolina and Georgetown Law graduate, Trey 
first came to our office in 2021 as my Legislative Counsel leading 
efforts in public safety, civil rights, civil liberties, and democracy 
preservation. A shining example of Trey&#x27;s brilliant work and true 
adherence to our ethos that ``Representation Begins with Listening,&#x27;&#x27; 
came a few short months after he started. Through a series of meetings, 
Trey listened to local public safety stakeholders and national experts 
and then turned that listening into action as he wrote the Pathways to 
Policing Act, a bill based on a Minnesota program to ensure the 
recruitment of high-quality police officers across the country.
  When our Legislative Director role came open in 2022, it was obvious 
who the correct choice should be to fill it. Right away, Trey exhibited 
true servant leadership and put the needs of his team above his own. He 
went out of his way to help staffers new to the legislative process and 
was endlessly patient, making his colleagues believe there was no such 
thing as a bad question. Trey&#x27;s empathy was an asset to the office and 
our constituents, whether he was skillfully managing the Community 
Project Funding process or pushing forward district-driven legislation. 
As one of my staffers said, ``Trey is thoughtful and exceptionally 
kind. He is always willing to go above and beyond to help others on the 
team. He explains even the most complicated of subjects in a way that 
brings people along without making them feel silly for asking.&#x27;&#x27;
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have his expertise and leadership, and he will be dearly missed. 
However, I&#x27;m extraordinarily happy that this expertise will continue to 
serve the Nation and the people of Nevada&#x27;s Third Congressional 
District. I wish Trey all the best in his future endeavors and thank 
him for his three years of faithful service to this Nation.

                          ____________________

                       SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS

  As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this

                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL BERNING

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, February 26, 2024

  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to honor the 
career of Michael Berning, a dedicated member of my community in 
Dayton, Ohio, and a close personal friend. Michael will retire this 
month after 44 years of service at HEAPY, an engineering firm that has 
its fingerprints all over Ohio and throughout the country. Michael 
started at HEAPY when he was still a Mechanical Engineering student at 
the University of Dayton, but he will end his tenure as its Chief 
Innovation Officer.
  Michael was an early pioneer for the development of `green design&#x27; 
and sustainable building practices, and his efforts culminated in 2015 
when he was named a LEED Fellow. This prestigious recognition is much-
deserved because of Michael&#x27;s leadership in HEAPY&#x27;s regional 
sustainability conferences, assisting Montgomery County in establishing 
the Dayton Regional Green Initiative, and for his contributions to 
Environmental Design+Construction Magazine as both a writer and member 
of the magazine&#x27;s Editorial Advisory Board.
  Outside of Michael&#x27;s work, he has served his community through 
multiple Boards, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Wright State 
ARTSGala, and the U.S. Green Building Council Ohio Chapter. Michael 
served as chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party in the 
early 1980s, and he managed my first campaign for public office when I 
ran for mayor of Dayton in 1993. He put together a great team for my 
election victory that year, in a predominantly Democratic city, and led 
my successful reelection effort four years later.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Michael 
Berning for his years of service to our community. Although retirement 
signals the end of his 44-year career with HEAPY, his legacy of success 
and leadership certainly serves as a model for others to follow. I 
congratulate Michael and wish him all the best in a well-deserved 
retirement, and look forward to many more years of continued 
friendship.

                          ____________________
