         CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT OF WILLIAM ``BILL&#x27;&#x27; TEAGUE

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. RAUL RUIZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a 
remarkable individual whose dedication and service to our communities 
has spanned nearly seven decades--Mr. William ``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Teague. As he 
embarks on his well-deserved retirement, I want to express my deepest 
gratitude for his unwavering commitment to the residents of Indio, 
California and the Coachella Valley.
  Bill&#x27;s journey with the Valley Sanitary District began in 1951 when 
he was hired as a Plant Operator. Over the next 34 years, he rose

[[Page E1060]]

through the ranks to become the General Manager, a position he held for 
28 years. His leadership not only enhanced our wastewater management 
but also set a standard for excellence that continues to benefit our 
community today.
  Bill retired as an employee of Valley Sanitary District in 1985, but 
his passion soon brought him back. In 1991, Bill was elected to the 
Valley Sanitary District Board of Directors, where he has served 
tirelessly for over 33 years, including two decades as President from 
1992-2011. His contributions have been invaluable, ensuring that our 
local water resources are managed with care and innovation. Bill also 
served on the East Valley Reclamation Authority, taking on various 
leadership roles, including President and Treasurer, further 
demonstrating his commitment to environmental stewardship.
  Throughout his career, Bill has received numerous accolades, 
including the prestigious Wm. D. Hatfield Award and recognition from 
both the Santa Ana Basin and Colorado River Basin for his significant 
contributions to the wastewater industry. His work with the California 
Water Pollution Control Agency and other organizations underscores his 
passion for public service and community improvement.
  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Bill has actively engaged 
with various community organizations, from the Indio Chamber of 
Commerce to the Coachella Valley Boys Club, always seeking to uplift 
those around him. His service on multiple committees and boards 
reflects his dedication to fostering a better community for all.
  As Bill retires from the Board of Directors in December 2024, we 
celebrate not only his professional achievements but also the lasting 
impact he has made on the lives of countless individuals in our 
communities.
  Mr. Speaker, let us all join in recognizing Bill Teague&#x27;s outstanding 
contributions to our community and extend our heartfelt gratitude for 
his years of dedicated service. On behalf of California&#x27;s 25th 
Congressional District, we wish him all the best in his retirement, 
knowing that he leaves behind a foundation of excellence that will 
inspire future leaders.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;d like to congratulate Ray Carlson for 
being named the Marquette County Veteran of the Year. I thank him for 
his immense sacrifices and love of country. Ray joined the United 
States Navy

[[Page E1063]]

shortly after graduating from Dollar Bay High School in 1969. After 
completing training at Great Lakes Naval Training Center, Camp 
Pendleton, and Coronado, Ray was deployed to Vietnam where he was 
stationed at TanAn and assigned to a Riverboat base, supporting combat 
operations throughout Vietnam as a central maintenance hub for U.S. 
watercraft.
  Ray returned home from his service just in time for Thanksgiving in 
1971, earning the National Defense Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and 
the Vietnam Campaign Medal for his time overseas. He began his civilian 
career in the Western UP at the White Copper Mine, and upon its 
closure, obtained a Civil Engineering Degree from Michigan 
Technological University. Ray went on to lead large civil engineering 
projects throughout the UP, culminating with the critical HW-58 project 
in Grand Marais. Ray&#x27;s emphasis on service above self did not stop 
there, as he has been incredibly active within the Veteran community, 
serving in numerous capacities throughout the American Legion, 
including Post 44 Commander, 12th District Commander, and the 5th Zone 
Commander--spanning the entire Upper Peninsula over the past 20 years. 
As one of the most active and dedicated individuals in the region, Ray 
also serves the community during Bingo at the Jacobetti Home for 
Veterans and Marquette County Fair, Boys State, and the Post 44 youth 
raffle. Ray also has even coached baseball for the American Legion 
teams. Reigniting a passion for the sport he enjoyed in his childhood, 
Ray&#x27;s time as a baseball coach has also helped many young men who 
received his mentorship and guidance--both on and off the field--as 
they have come through the Legion summer ball program.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Ray Carlson as the Marquette 
County Veteran of the Year. I thank him for a lifetime of dedicated 
service and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

           HONORING THE LEGACY OF WILLIAM JOHN VUKOVICH, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today, we gather to pay tribute to a 
legendary figure in the world of motorsports, Bill Vukovich, Jr., who 
recently passed away at the age of 79. Bill Vukovich, Jr., a native of 
Fresno, California, was not only a highly accomplished racer but also 
an integral part of a racing dynasty that left an indelible mark on the 
sport.
  Bill Vukovich, Jr. began his racing career in 1965 and continued 
until 1983 competing in the IndyCar Series and USAC Championship. His 
talent and determination on the track earned him recognition, including 
the title of the 1968 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year. Over the 
years, he participated in the Indy 500, achieving six top-10 finishes, 
including a memorable second-place finish in 1973.
  However, what set the Vukovich family apart was not just individual 
success but their unique status as a three-generation racing family: 
Bill Vukovich, Jr., his father Bill Vukovich, Sr., and his son Bill 
Vukovich, III became the first, three-generation family, to compete in 
the prestigious Indianapolis 500. Their ascent from being local racing 
heroes in the heart of the Central Valley to the grandeur of the Indy 
stage deeply resonated with the local community, providing them with 
cherished figures to fervently rally behind. Tragically, alongside 
their triumphs, the Vukovich family also endured profound losses. Bill 
Vukovich, Sr., a two-time Indianapolis 500 champion, tragically lost 
his life in a racing accident in 1955. Bill Vukovich, Jr. was just 11 
years old at the time, forever marked by the radio broadcast that 
informed him of his father&#x27;s fatal crash. Then, in 1990, another 
devastating blow struck the family when Bill Vukovich, III lost control 
of his car during practice at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield, 
resulting in a fatal crash. Bill Vukovich, Jr. was 46 when he 
tragically lost his only son, known affectionately as ``Billy.&#x27;&#x27;
  Reflecting on these unimaginable losses, Bill Vukovich, Jr. once 
said, ``It happened to me twice--the impossible happened twice.&#x27;&#x27; The 
biography of the Vukovich family published in 2012, authored by Bones 
Bourcier, revealed the profound impact of these tragedies, especially 
the loss of Billy Vukovich, III, on Bill Vukovich, Jr., describing it 
as a ``total loss of control.&#x27;&#x27;
  In 1981, Bill Vukovich, Jr. was rightfully inducted into the Fresno 
Athletic Hall of Fame, joining his father, who was part of the 1959 
induction class, and his son, who was honored in 2007. Throughout his 
racing career, Bill Vukovich, Jr. participated in 158 races, achieving 
Top 10 finishes an impressive 85 times. His journey included thrilling 
Saturday nights at Kearney Bowl, a now-defunct dirt oval track in 
southwest Fresno. In 2019, the City of Fresno paid tribute to the 
Vukovich racing legacy by placing a memorial in front of Selland Arena 
in downtown Fresno. Today, as we remember Bill Vukovich, Jr., we can 
find solace in the thought that he has found peace and has reunited 
with his beloved son.
  Mr. Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring 
the life and legacy of Bill Vukovich, Jr. His contributions to 
motorsports and the enduring spirit of the Vukovich racing dynasty will 
forever hold a special place in the heart of our community and the 
world of racing.

             HONORING THE LIFE OF GREGORY ``DON&#x27;&#x27; HUNSUCKER

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Gregory 
``Don&#x27;&#x27; Hunsucker, a beloved husband, brother, father, and leader.
  Born on August 29, 1947, Gregory was one of two sons born to Gragrie 
and Jolene (Frazier) Hunsucker. Growing up, Don learned lessons such as 
to always fight for what is right, to help those who can&#x27;t help 
themselves, and to never, ever give up which served him well when 
doctors told him he would never walk again due to an accident he 
sustained while riding a horse at Church camp. True to his virtues, Don 
not only walked again but went on to pursue his athletic aspirations at 
Parlier High school and even college after.
  Parlier High is also where Don met the love of his life, Linda Mae, 
who he described as the prettiest girl he ever saw. Lucky for him, her 
devotion matched his infatuation and the two shared a bond for the next 
55 years, dedicating their lives to their greatest gifts, Jerry and 
Michelle. As a husband and father, Mr. Hunsucker cherished every moment 
with his family. Whether it was dressing up as Santa on Christmas or 
teaching them how to throw a football, he always made sure to not just 
tell them he loved them but showed them as well.
  In 1971, Don decided to join the fight of the labor movement and 
began serving as a Special Representative and Organizer for the Retail 
Clerks International Association. Eventually, he became the Union 
Representative for the Retail Clerks Local 1288, and following the 
merger of several unions he was elected as the President--Chief 
Executive Officer of the United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 
1288. As the youngest person to ever be elected President of a local 
union, Mr. Hunsucker was fearless in his struggle to advocate for his 
members but always managed to conduct himself with respect when 
interacting with others. Whether it was at the negotiating table or 
heading a picket line, Don always put his members first which grew ten-
fold by the time he retired in 2007.
  Throughout his distinguished career, he also held many titles in 
other organizations such as Vice President of the California Federation 
of Labor, Chair of the Northern California Caucus, Trustee of the 
Northern California Joint Pension Fund, President of the Fresno-Madera-
Tulare-Kings Counties Central Labor Council, and Vice President of the 
Fresno Area Coalition of Organized Labor. Even after his retirement, 
Mr. Hunsucker continued to help and honor workers of the Central Valley 
by becoming President of the UFCW Local 1288 Retiree&#x27;s Club where he 
was instrumental in founding Union Park, and Workers Memorial 
Foundation, Inc. For all of these efforts and more, Don was named Labor 
Leader of the Year three times in his lifetime.
  In addition to his commitment to labor, Don was extremely involved 
within his community as well. For example, he helped raise money for 
the Cancer Society, Leukemia Society, Muscular Dystrophy and the Fresno 
State Boosters Club. He also served as a board member for several 
organizations including United Way, the Easter Seal Society, and the 
City of Fresno&#x27;s Bid Compliance Committee. Don truly did it all and was 
more than deserving of all the recognition he received, including the 
Key to the City of Fresno as well as the City of Parlier.
  Despite his countless achievements, Don always remained true to the 
virtues he learned as a child and committed his life to fighting for 
what he felt was right. He was a leader of the community and his 
willingness to stand up for others was admired by many. Although his 
love and thoughtfulness will be missed greatly by those fortunate to 
know him, his legacy will live on through the love of his life, Linda 
Mae, and their greatest gifts, Michelle and Jerry.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Gregory 
``Don&#x27;&#x27; Hunsucker for his contributions to labor and the community. May 
we continue to be inspired by his story.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Harry Haskins, Jr., who 
passed away on September 1, at the age of 87. Mr. Haskins dedicated his 
life to law enforcement and the well-being of Virginians.
  Mr. Haskins was born in Clifton Forge, Virginia on October 8, 1936. 
He graduated from the old Clifton Forge High School. He later earned an 
Associate&#x27;s degree from Virginia Western Community College and a 
Bachelor of Arts degree from Roanoke College.
  His service to law enforcement began in 1958 as a trooper with 
Virginia State Police, where he dedicated 16 years of his career.
  In 1974, he became a Special Agent with the U.S. Forest Service, 
before accepting a position as Chief of Police for the City of Salem in 
1975.
  As Chief of Police, Mr. Haskins excelled at his job and became a 
fixture in the Salem community. His contributions to Salem&#x27;s police 
force included establishing the Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
program.
  Mr. Haskins was a founding member of the Cardinal Criminal Justice 
Academy, serving as Chairman of the Governing Council for 10 years. His 
experience on the Executive Committee of the Virginia Association of 
Chiefs of Police, which included a stint as President, allowed him to 
advocate for law enforcement officials and improve department 
practices.
  His outstanding service to the Commonwealth of Virginia and City of 
Salem would last two decades until his retirement at the end of 1995.
  The City of Salem elected Mr. Haskins in 1996 to serve on City 
Council. I worked with Mr. Haskins during his time as Chief of Police 
and as a member of Salem City Council. He was a classic southern 
gentleman, and it was an honor to know him.
  The recognition of Mr. Haskins&#x27; character and accomplishments is 
evident. He received in 1996 the Roanoke College Medal, the highest 
honor bestowed on Roanoke College alumni who best exemplify the ideals 
of leadership, integrity and citizenship that Maroons hold dear. He 
also received the Boy Scouts of America Silver Beaver Award.
  He is survived by his loving wife, Judith Barrett Haskins; daughters 
and husbands, Melanie and Scott Leweke of Blue Ridge, Virginia, and 
Kathryn and Kevin Glasgow of Georgia; and Nadine Kelley of Roanoke, 
mother of his children. Also surviving are stepchildren, Will Abernethy 
of Roanoke, Nathan and Julie Abernethy of Roanoke, Whitney Miller of 
Dillwyn, and Steve Wilson and Ken Wilson. Surviving grandchildren are 
Greg and Sam Glasgow, Emma and Mary Leweke, and step-grandchildren 
Kaylee and Rachel Goin, Elijah, Nora and Isaac Abernethy.
  The City of Salem and the law enforcement community is forever 
grateful to Chief Haskins, the professionalism he embodied during his 
law enforcement career, and his dedication to the safety and well-being 
of the people of Salem.

           RECOGNIZING DAVID BAKER&#x27;S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE

                                 ______

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. David 
Baker on winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The Nobel Prize award 
recognizes Dr. Baker&#x27;s tremendous achievement in utilizing 
computational protein design to turn amino acids into proteins. He has 
made significant strides in the field of biochemistry through his 
groundbreaking research and has trailblazed various methods to build 
new proteins.
  Dr. Baker is currently a Professor of Biochemistry at the University 
of Washington in Seattle. He is the eighth University of Washington 
faculty member to receive a Nobel Prize. Dr. Baker&#x27;s research has been 
described as visionary. His lab pioneered the field by developing much 
of the world&#x27;s most popular and effective software for computational 
protein design. Dr. Baker&#x27;s research has helped analyze database 
information about existing proteins to develop new proteins that do not 
exist in nature.
  His success has allowed for the creation of novel proteins to tackle 
some of the greatest challenges in medicine, technology, and 
sustainability. He has deepened scientific understanding of protein 
prediction and made immense contributions to biochemistry research. Dr. 
Baker&#x27;s career has been remarkable--to date, he has published more than 
640 peer-reviewed research papers, been awarded more than 100 patents, 
and co-founded 21 biotechnology companies.
  I was proud to secure $550,000 for the Institute for Protein Design 
at the University of Washington where Dr. Baker&#x27;s lab is housed. I am 
committed to ensuring that Washington&#x27;s 7th Congressional District 
remains a hub for science and innovation. Scientists like Dr. Baker are 
at the forefront of innovation and must have the resources to continue 
to change our understanding of the world.
  On behalf of Washington&#x27;s 7th Congressional District, I would like to 
congratulate Dr. David Baker on receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 
I am so proud to recognize his tremendous contributions to science and 
innovation.

               RECOGNIZING FORMER MAYOR CHRISTOPHER BROWN

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Mayor 
Christopher Brown, a distinguished resident of Dumfries, Virginia, 
whose dedication and service have profoundly shaped his community.
  Mr. Brown&#x27;s roots run deep in Dumfries, where he has spent his life 
contributing to the town&#x27;s growth and prosperity. As a former mayor, 
Mr. Brown played a pivotal role in shaping Dumfries&#x27; future, 
demonstrating exceptional leadership and vision during his tenure.
  Beyond his public service, Mr. Brown continues to be a pillar of the 
community through his successful accounting firm. Established in 1987, 
his business has provided professional personal and business tax advice 
and preparation for more than three decades. His expertise and 
commitment to supporting local enterprises has been instrumental in 
fostering economic growth in Dumfries.
  Mr. Brown&#x27;s many contributions--as a lifelong resident, former mayor, 
and respected business owner--have left an indelible mark on the town. 
His accounting firm stands as a testament to his enduring commitment to 
the local business community.
  Mr. Brown&#x27;s unwavering dedication to Dumfries serves as an 
inspiration to all who strive to make a positive impact on their 
communities. His work ethic, business acumen, and public service 
exemplify the values we hold dear as Virginians.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing former 
Mayor Christopher Brown for his outstanding service and enduring 
commitment to the Town of Dumfries, Virginia. His legacy as a public 
servant, business leader, and admired community member will continue to 
influence and inspire future generations in Virginia.

       RECOGNIZING RETIRED LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN PHILIP KOWZAN

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
retired Lieutenant CoIonel John Philip Kowzan. A native of Spokane, 
Washington, Phil joined the United States Army in 1961 and selflessly 
served his Nation for 28 years. During his time in the military, he was 
called upon to serve in Vietnam where he earned the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with 3 bronze service stars, 
and the Army Commendation Medal with 2 oak leaf clusters.
  During his decorated military service, retired LTC Kowzan developed a 
profound respect for his fellow servicemembers. He saw firsthand the 
personal sacrifices of life and limb that his brothers and sisters in 
arms were prepared to make, as well as the invisible scars they would 
each carry home with them. Phil&#x27;s profound understanding of these 
struggles motivated him to dedicate the remainder of his life to 
honoring those who answered our nation&#x27;s call to service.
  In 2001, Phil was asked to perform Taps in conjunction with a 
military funeral honors service for a longtime friend and fellow 
veteran. A musician at heart who played in a number of community bands 
through the years, he humbly accepted the request as a way of 
fulfilling the obligation cited by President Abraham Lincoln to ``Honor 
to the soldier and sailor everywhere, who bravely bears his country&#x27;s 
cause.&#x27;&#x27;
  Thus began a 23-year long run as a bugler in Eastern Washington.
  In 2010, the community&#x27;s demand for Phil&#x27;s services grew 
exponentially when the Washington Department of Veterans Affairs opened 
the Washington State Veterans Cemetery in Medical Lake, Wash. Without 
hesitation, Phil volunteered to assist with military funeral honors as 
one of the facility&#x27;s three buglers. In the first year alone, he 
performed more than half of the 350 interments at the cemetery, which 
now performs more than 900 services annually. As the facility&#x27;s primary 
bugler, Phil frequently makes the 46 mile round trip--as often as five 
times a week--to ensure every veteran receives the honor and 
recognition of a grateful nation they deserve.
  Phil quickly earned a reputation amongst the region&#x27;s funeral 
directors and soon began receiving calls to perform at community 
cemeteries, funeral homes, event halls, and public events across the 
state.
  At 86 years young, Phil still carries the same burning desire he 
first felt 23 years ago to make sure no servicemember is ever left 
behind. In total, he has rendered honors for more than 3,000 military 
funerals in the Spokane area, making him an inspiration to every person 
he meets. Phil is a decorated veteran, committed public servant, and 
model citizen. He is simply the very best of the United States of 
America.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing retired 
LTC John Philip Kowzan for his more than 50 years of faithful, diligent 
service to our Nation.

Management and Internal Control Program. She ensured sound fiscal 
compliance and safeguarded government resources against fraud, waste, 
and misuse as manager of the Anti-deficiency Act prevention/reporting

Certification. She has earned many significant awards and honors 
throughout her 42-year career, including 2 Civilian Service Achievement 
Medals and The American Society of Military Comptrollers Award for 
Meritorious Performance in Accounting and Finance. She also received a 
Letter of Appreciation from the Secretary of the Army.
  Our great nation is not able to function properly without the work of 
people like Tamara Henderson. Few people have dedicated their entire 
career to Civilian Federal Service, and it is my great pleasure to 
offer my own congratulations for Ms. Henderson on the happy occasion of 
her retirement after 42 years of service to the United States. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the dedicated career of 
Tamara Henderson.

VETERANS DELIVER LETTERS TO U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES ACROSS U.S., 
URGING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF BIDEN ADMINISTRATION&#x27;S ARMS SHIPMENTS 
                               TO ISRAEL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN B. LARSON

                       Tuesday, October 22, 2024

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in 
the Record the following press release from Veterans For Peace, brought 
to my attention by Jim Brasile, a constituent and leader of a local 
chapter of Veterans For Peace who cares passionately about the 
situation in Gaza. While I may have a difference in opinion with some 
of the content, I feel that in a democracy, it is important to consider 
a variety of viewpoints. Mr. Brasile witnessed the violence of war 
first-hand when he served in Vietnam as a member of the U.S. Marine 
Corps. Since then, he has been a steadfast advocate against conflict 
and for non-aggression. I thank Mr. Brasile for his service to our 
country and commend him for his commitment to peace.

 numerous federal criminal statute violations cited, no response from 
                   state department inspector-general

       In sixteen U.S. cities, March 5 through 7, members of 
     Veterans For Peace will hand deliver an exhaustively 
     researched letter to U.S. State Department offices that has 
     gotten no response from the department&#x27;s Inspector-General 
     since February 11.
       The cities are Buffalo, New York, Minneapolis, St. Louis, 
     Portsmouth, NH, Greensboro, NC, Boston, San Diego, Tucson, 
     Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Bridgeport, CT, Los Angeles, 
     Dallas and Houston.
       Josh Paul, former State Department senior official who 
     resigned over weapons shipments to Israel said, ``The 
     Secretary and all relevant officials under his purview should 
     take this letter from Veterans For Peace with the utmost 
     seriousness. It is a stark reminder of the importance of 
     abiding by the laws and policies that relate to arms 
     transfers.&#x27;&#x27;
       The letter from Veterans For Peace alleges violations by 
     U.S. government officials of:
       The Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, which prohibits U.S. 
     weapons transfers when it&#x27;s likely they will be used by 
     Israel to commit genocide; crimes against humanity; and grave 
     breaches of the Geneva Conventions, including attacks 
     intentionally directed against civilian objects or civilians 
     or other serious violations of international humanitarian or 
     human rights law, including serious acts of gender-based 
     violence or serious acts of violence against children. Dozens 
     of authoritative complaints and referrals made by hospital 
     administrators in Gaza, as well as by Amnesty International, 
     Human Rights Watch, Palestine Authority, South Africa, 
     Turkey, Medicins san Frontieres, UNRWA, UNICEF, the 
     Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Norwegian 
     Refugee Council and the World Food Programme, have confirmed 
     that there is an ongoing human rights and humanitarian 
     disaster due to Israel&#x27;s cutoff of water and electricity, 
     deliberate destruction of sewage infrastructure and delaying 
     of aid shipments by Israeli forces.
       The Foreign Assistance Act, which forbids the provision of 
     assistance to a government which ``engages in a consistent 
     pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized 
     human rights.&#x27;&#x27; Arms Export Control Act, which says countries 
     that receive U.S. military aid can only use weapons for 
     legitimate self-defense and internal security. Israel&#x27;s 
     genocidal campaign in Gaza goes way beyond self-defense and 
     internal security.
       The U.S. War Crimes Act, which forbids grave breaches of 
     the Geneva Conventions, including willful killing, torture or 
     inhuman treatment, willfully causing great suffering or 
     serious injury to body or health, and unlawful deportation or 
     transfer, perpetrated by the Israeli Occupying Forces.
       The Leahy Law, which prohibits the U.S. Government from 
     using funds for assistance to units of foreign security 
     forces where there is credible information implicating that 
     unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights.
       The Genocide Convention Implementation Act, which was 
     enacted to implement U.S. obligations under the Genocide 
     Convention, provides for criminal penalties for individuals 
     who commit or incite others to commit genocide.
       Mike Ferner, VFP National Director, said, ``Just as any 
     good soldier can recognize when they are given an unlawful 
     order, we believe some State Department staff are horrified 
     at the orders they&#x27;re given and will decide to uphold the 
     law, find the courage to speak out and demand an end to the 
     carnage. VFP enthusiastically supports Josh Paul for what he 
     did and we believe the public does, too. The IDF has killed 
     over 30,000 Palestinians and is utterly destroying Gaza. 
     These actions amount to genocide, war crimes, and crimes 
     against humanity, and VFP wants them investigated.&#x27;&#x27;
       Veterans For Peace has over 100 chapters in the U.S. and 
     since 1985 has exposed the true costs of war and militarism. 
     Its goal is to abolish war as an instrument of national 
     policy.
