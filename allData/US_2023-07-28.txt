        HONORING ARMY NATIONAL GUARD MAJOR MIRANDA SUMMERS LOWE

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. ANDY KIM

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 28, 2023

  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an 
exceptional member of the Army National Guard, Major Miranda Summers 
Lowe and her distinguished service and dedication to my office and her 
work to connect me and my office better with the National Guard.
  A native of Muncie, Indiana, Major Summers Lowe enlisted in the 
Indiana Army National Guard and was later commissioned as an 
intelligence officer. She has served 21 years in Indiana, Virginia, 
Rhode Island, and Washington D.C. National Guards in a broad range of 
drill status and Active-Duty assignments, including deployments to Iraq 
in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and to Djibouti in support of 
Operation Enduring Freedom. Currently, she is excelling as a military 
personnel liaison for the National Guard Bureau Office of Legislative 
Liaison, where she is working on ways to improve the quality of life 
for our National Guard Servicemembers and Airmen.
  This work builds off of her years of experience in the Legislative 
Liaison Division as the Congressional Activities Branch Chief and an 
Army Congressional Fellow in my office. Major Summers Lowe has served 
Active-Duty tours in the Chief of Staff of the Army&#x27;s Operation 
Enduring Study Group and the Office of the Director, Army National 
Guard. Her attention to detail and responsiveness strengthened the 
relationship between my office and the National Guard immeasurably. 
It&#x27;s my understanding that Major Summers Lowe formulated the 
congressional engagement plan and prepared National Guard leadership 
for over 130 meetings and hearings, as well as playing a pivotal role 
in informing congressional members about the National Guard Bureau&#x27;s 
legislative priorities. Her efforts played a pivotal role in developing 
National Guard healthcare access improvements.
  In my office, Major Summers Lowe answered hundreds of congressional 
inquiries and was an integral part of my office&#x27;s process in reviewing 
and making amendments to the

[[Page E744]]

National Defense Authorization Act. After concluding her current 
assignment in August, Major Summers Lowe will take on another 
challenging role as the deputy director of the National Guard History 
Office.
  She embodies the qualities that our country expects from our officer 
corps. It&#x27;s clear she has a promising career ahead in continued service 
to our Nation. I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to Major 
Summers Lowe for her work with my office and her steadfast dedication 
to National Guard missions. I want to thank her for the work she&#x27;s done 
for me, my office, and wish her all the best in her next chapter.

                          ____________________

             HONORING PRIVATE FIRST-CLASS RICHARD BARANCIK

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KAY GRANGER

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 28, 2023

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of 
Private First-Class Richard Barancik who passed away on July 14, 2023. 
He was the final surviving member of the ``Monuments Men&#x27;&#x27;, the World 
War II heroes who were responsible for finding and safeguarding the 
artistic and cultural achievements of western civilization stolen by 
the Nazis.
  Private First-Class Barancik enlisted in the Army and joined the 42nd 
Division, 232 Infantry in Austria, where he learned of the Monuments, 
Fine Arts, and Archives program, and, applied for duty. For several 
weeks, Private First-Class Barancik and his unit assisted in the 
movement of stolen art treasures to the central repository of Property 
Control Branch and served as its guards. From his arrival in Salzburg, 
he was enamored with the dedication of the citizenry to art. After his 
service, he would go on to attend Cambridge University in London, 
finish his architecture degree at the University of Illinois, and found 
an eponymous architecture firm that designed numerous buildings, 
campuses, and dwellings throughout Illinois. Private First-Class 
Barancik is remembered as a man of sharp mind and strong conviction, a 
lover of art, and a devoted father and grandfather.
  When I first learned about the Monuments Men and Women, I was struck 
by their story and wanted to recognize the brave men and women of this 
unit for their contributions during World War II. In 2014, I had the 
opportunity to sponsor the Monuments Men Recognition Act which awarded 
their unit with the Congressional Gold Medal, and I was thrilled when 
it was signed into law. I was lucky to have the opportunity to meet 
Richard Barancik, and 4 of the other Monuments Men and Women in 2015 at 
the presentation ceremony of their Congressional Gold Medal. They 
fought tirelessly against an unwavering evil to preserve the greater 
parts of our history and I am immensely proud to say that I have been a 
supporter of the Monuments Men and Women Foundation from its inception.
  The closing of Richard Barancik&#x27;s final chapter again underscores the 
reality that our Nation&#x27;s veterans of World War II have already begun 
to recede from our present, and into the endless window of our 
memories. His work, viewed through this lens, has bestowed to younger 
generations the highest legacy to which any man could aspire. Without 
the service of his unit, great treasures of history and art would have 
been irrevocably lost.
  Our country, and our world, owes Mr. Barancik the greatest honor, 
both in memory and in practice. Rest in peace Private First-Class 
Barancik, an irreplaceable part of our Nation&#x27;s greatest triumph, and 
an American hero in his own right.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 28, 2023

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the work of World 
Harvest United Churches during their 2023 National Holy Gathering in 
Dumfries, Virginia.
  An annual event, the National Holy Gathering brings people together 
in the spirit of service. This year&#x27;s theme is ``Ignite 2023,&#x27;&#x27; and it 
is guided by Matthew 5:14-16: ``You are the light of the world. A town 
built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and 
put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives 
light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine 
before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your 
Father in heaven.&#x27;&#x27;
  Guided by Presiding Prelate Bishop Calvin B. Davis, Sr., and hosted 
by Virginia State Bishop Kenneth W. Jones, Sr., this gathering provides 
attendees with activities, classes, and worship events. It culminates 
with a day of volunteerism and outreach in conjunction with Habitat for 
Humanity ReStore, Women of Worth, and Project-Mend-A-House.
  Finally, ``Ignite 2023&#x27;&#x27; would not be possible without the hard work 
of community leaders like Bishop George W. Thigpen, III, Bishop of 
Outreach, Pastor Kathleen Deane, National Director of Outreach, Elder 
Daniel M. Deane, Sr., Adjutant General, Bishop Rick Boykin, Co-Adjutor 
to the State Bishop, and Lady Michelle Thigpen, Director of Women of 
Worth Virginia.
  Mr. Speaker, l ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating World 
Harvest Churches on 11 years of service to the community through their 
annual National Holy Gathering. Their outreach and community-oriented 
mindset is invaluable to Virginia.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 28, 2023

  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart on Marc Fogel&#x27;s 62nd birthday. Marc, a native of Butler County, 
Pennsylvania, isn&#x27;t celebrating with his family today because he&#x27;s 
wrongfully detained in Russia.
  On August 14, 2021, Marc was returning to Russia for the start of the 
school year at the Anglo-American School in Moscow, where he teaches. 
But instead, he was arrested at the airport.
  Since his arrest, Marc was sentenced and is currently serving an 
exorbitant 14-year hard labor sentence. His situation qualifies for a 
``wrongly detained&#x27;&#x27; status from the U.S. Department of State, yet this 
determination has not been made despite repeated requests from 
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including me.
  Mr. Speaker, I proudly support a resolution calling for Marc&#x27;s 
immediate release and I urge my colleagues to do the same, today, on 
his birthday.
  I also encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4388, the Marc Fogel 
Act, to ensure transparency and accountability at the State Department 
when wrongful determinations are considered.
  Mr. Speaker, we have not forgotten Marc. It is time to bring him home 
and I implore the President and Secretary of State to do everything 
they can so he may rejoin his family--his wife, Jane, and sons Sam and 
Ethan--as soon as possible.

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize World War 
II Veteran, Dean A. Preston for receiving the French Legion d&#x27;honneur, 
which honors World War II Veterans for their service as they fought to 
secure France&#x27;s liberation.
  The National Order of the Legion of Honour was established by 
Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 and serves as the highest order of merit 
awarded by the French government for military and civil honors. The 
Legion d&#x27;honneur has been awarded to Veterans from various countries 
for their bravery and service during D-Day military operations who 
assisted in the security of France.
  Dean A. Preston graduated from Pekin Community High School and 
enlisted to serve his country. He attended an advanced radio repair 
school which equipped him with a skillset to manage wireless radio 
networks following his completion of basic training. Dean was inducted 
into the United States Army on March 20, 1943, and served as a member 
of 927th Signal Battalion, Separate, Tactical Air Command.
  Dean earned several distinguished honors throughout his service 
including the American Campaign Medal, the European African Middle East 
Campaign Medal with 5 Campaign Stars, the Army Good Conduct Medal, and 
the World War II Victory Medal. Dean&#x27;s strong communication, bravery, 
and commitment to service distinguishes him as a recipient of the 
French Legion d&#x27;honneur.
  We live in the greatest country in the world because of men and women 
like Dean. Dean is proud to have served and contribute to liberty and 
freedom. I extend my sincere congratulations to Dean A. Preston for 
receiving the French Legion d&#x27;honneur.

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Goodfellows, a 
charitable organization, based in the city of Dearborn in Michigan&#x27;s 
12th District Strong, as they celebrate 100 years of giving.
  Founded in 1923 as the Good Cheer Club, Goodfellows is Dearborn&#x27;s 
oldest charitable organization. Local business owners came together to 
raise money by selling newspapers to ensure ``no child without 
Christmas.&#x27;&#x27; That became the organization&#x27;s motto. Over the years, 
Goodfellows has grown in its reach and capacity, partnering with local 
fire and police departments to serve families in need from far beyond 
its beginnings in Dearborn. Countless families can count on their 
holiday gift distribution program, an event I happily volunteer my time 
to each year. And even more families are served by their school supply 
drives, scholarships and even emergency funding. Dearborn

[[Page E745]]

Goodfellows relies heavily on committed volunteers every year who bring 
heart to everything they do.
  Please join me in recognizing Goodfellows of Dearborn for its 
outstanding work and commitment to serving families in need.

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Reverend 
Solomon W. Kinloch, Jr.&#x27;s incredible community and pastoral leadership 
in Michigan&#x27;s 12th Congressional District.
  Reverend Solomon W. Kinloch, Jr. was born to the late Solomon, Sr. 
and Janie Cousar Kinloch on July 28, 1973. He began his work in 
ministry under the tutelage of Rev. Robert Smith, Jr. at the New Bethel 
Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan. In 1998, Reverend Kinloch accepted 
his call to pastor at Triumph Church in Detroit, Michigan. At the 
beginning of his tenure, Triumph Church&#x27;s membership was less than 50 
people. Under Rev. Kinloch&#x27;s visionary leadership, Triumph Church has 
since grown into several campuses with thirteen weekly services for 
more than 40,000 members.
  During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Reverend Kinloch 
spearheaded the expansion of Triumph Church&#x27;s outreach with the 
creation of `Drive-In Church&#x27; at their Southfield location and 6 online 
worship services, spreading hope and helping the community stay 
connected when they could not safely gather in person. Reverend Kinloch 
held prayer calls to help our community and their membership remain 
grounded in their faith and continuing to spread joy amongst fear. 
Reverend Kinloch ensured our communities had access to basic needs for 
their ability to not just survive the pandemic but thrive, by providing 
free laptops for members in need and other essentials like food and 
access to testing. Reverend Kinloch&#x27;s year-round exemplary leadership 
will always be a testament to his unwavering faith and his commitment 
and drive to serve others.
  Please join me in recognition of Reverend Kinloch&#x27;s numerous 
accomplishments and service to the people of Michigan&#x27;s 12th District. 
We thank him for his service and wish him well.

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Wood County 
Agricultural Society on the 150th Anniversary of the Wood County Fair. 
Since 1873, the Wood County Fair has been a proud tradition of 
Northwest Ohio and has served as an outlet for county residents to 
showcase their talents, skills, and benevolence. Over the course of 150 
years, the Fair has continued to promote the county&#x27;s heritage, bring 
the community together, and encourage friendly competition with the 
junior fair.
  The first Wood County Fair was held near the corner of today&#x27;s W. 
Wooster and N. Grove Streets in Bowling Green, Ohio. Between 1851 to 
1885, it was held in various locations around Wood County including 
Bowling Green, Perrysburg, Portage, and Tontogany. From 1882 to 1927, 
the fair was held in what is now the Bowling Green City Park. Although 
there was not an official fair between 1928 to 1950, events that 
highlighted and celebrated the county&#x27;s agriculture base included 
Tomato Festivals, Harvest Festivals, and Fall Festivals. The fair has 
been held at the current location since 1951.
  Although the first fair wasn&#x27;t held until 1873, Wood County&#x27;s 
beginnings set the foundation for the agricultural spirit that is still 
felt today during the fair. Wood County was once home to the Great 
Black Swamp. This made settlement of the area extremely difficult, but 
the pioneering spirit of early residents produced an extensive system 
of ditches, which drained the swamp and revealed the rich farmland 
beneath. There are still more than 3,000 miles of drainage ditches 
keeping the county dry to this day, and agriculture continues to power 
Wood County&#x27;s economy.
  Even after the population spiked due to the discovery of oil and 
natural gas in the late 1800s, agriculture continued to dominate Wood 
County&#x27;s economy. The county supports the rural traditions and history 
of the area that fosters agricultural ingenuity, manufacturing 
developments, and educational success. All of these factors have 
contributed to a successful fair that highlights all aspects of the 
county.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute 
to the Wood County Agricultural Society on this significant milestone. 
On behalf of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Ohio, I 
wish the Wood County Agricultural Society continued success on this 
150th Wood County Fair.
