                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023

  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Minneapolis City Council 
Member Andrew Johnson for his hard work and dedication to public 
service over the past decade. Over the years, Mr. Johnson has been 
applauded for his community engagement and commitment to small 
businesses and affordable housing. I had the pleasure of working for 
Mr. Johnson from 2013 to 2015 as his campaign manager and then Senior 
Policy Aide.
  Council Member Johnson was first elected to office in 2013 and, at 
the time, was the youngest member on the Council. For three terms, he 
has proudly served the constituents of Ward 12, which includes the 
neighborhoods of Cooper, Ericsson, Hiawatha, Howe, Keewaydin, 
Minnehaha, Morris Park, and Standish, in the southeastern corner of 
Minneapolis. During his tenure, Mr. Johnson served as the chair of the 
Public Works and Infrastructure Committee, Intergovernmental Relations 
Committee, and the Information Technology Subcommittee.
  Over the past ten years, Council Member Johnson has participated in 
nearly 400 community meetings with his constituents. As a devoted 
advocate for housing, he worked on the creation of hundreds of housing 
units within Ward 12. Mr. Johnson also led the City in creating its 
first new public-housing project in more than a decade. He has been a 
champion for transit throughout his tenure, working on ordinances to 
ensure that sidewalks were clear of ice for residents, pushing for 
funding for street repairs, and advocating for more lanes and safety 
precautions for bikers. He worked to ensure that all constituents, 
whether they walked, biked, drove, or used public transit had access to 
safe transportation.
  Council Member Johnson has had an impressive track record of serving 
his community. Key accomplishments that I want to recognize include the 
creation of the Small Business Office and Business Portal to serve 
local small business owners. He also authored the ordinance that 
allowed gender-neutral single-stall restrooms, led the efforts to 
rewrite the Animal Care and Control Ordinances to improve the quality 
of life for animals in shelters and was a co-founding member of the 
Transgender Equity Council. Last, but certainly not least, Mr. Johnson 
was also the lead sponsor of an ordinance that granted paid sick leave 
to over 100,000 constituents.
  No problem has ever been too big or too small for City Council Member 
Johnson. Although his time as a city council member is coming to an 
end, the legacy of his work for our community and the City of 
Minneapolis will never be forgotten. He will truly be missed at City 
Hall and by his constituents.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Mayor 
Mark Senter, who is completing his tenure of dedicated service to 
Plymouth, Indiana at the end of this month.
  Currently serving in his fourth term, Mayor Senter has advanced 
solutions that have made Plymouth a better place to live, work, and 
raise a family. In particular, Mark can and should be proud of his work 
in helping create downtown Plymouth&#x27;s River Park Square, which hosts 
the popular ``Mayor&#x27;s Month of Music&#x27;&#x27; event every August.
  Prior to becoming Mayor, Mark served as a trooper and detective with 
the Indiana State Police for 28 years. Mark&#x27;s service on the thin blue 
line has given him valuable firsthand knowledge of the public safety 
issues our communities face as well as the brave sacrifices law 
enforcement officers make in the line of duty every single day.
  As he prepares to step down as Mayor, spend more time with his 
family, and write the next chapter of his life, I am proud to 
congratulate Mark on a distinguished career and a job well done. The 
Plymouth community and all of Marshall County is unquestionably better 
off thanks to this good man with a servant&#x27;s heart.
  I join Hoosiers throughout Indiana&#x27;s Second Congressional District in 
expressing our gratitude to Mayor Mark Senter for his service and in 
wishing him, his wife Leanne, and their family all the very best going 
forward.

   RECOGNIZING KAREN CLEVELAND FOR HER SERVICE TO LEADERSHIP FAIRFAX

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend Karen 
Cleveland on an inspired career in community service. Earlier this 
year, Karen announced she would be transitioning from her role as 
President &amp; CEO of Leadership Fairfax (LFI), which is Northern 
Virginia&#x27;s premier leadership development organization.
  Karen has become a pillar of our community during her eight-year 
tenure with LFI, so I am pleased to report this is not so much a 
retirement as a turning of the page to her next chapter. I&#x27;ve had the 
pleasure of knowing and collaborating with Karen for the past three 
decades, starting with my service on the Fairfax County Board of 
Supervisors.
  Since 1988, LFI has dedicated itself to shaping the future leaders of 
tomorrow. The dedication of LFI to this endeavor is one that I know 
well; a number of my staff from my time as Providence District 
Supervisor and later as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of 
Supervisors are LFI alumni.
  I know firsthand the value that LFI adds to both the graduates and 
the organizations to which they return. When you walk into a crowded 
room it&#x27;s easy to spot the graduates of LFI--they just stand out!
  Karen has been an invaluable resource to leaders in both the public 
and private sectors, serving as a facilitator, mentor, partner, and 
friend to us through her work on multiple community initiatives.
  In addition to her role with LFI, Karen has made important 
contributions to our community as the first executive director of the 
Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce, inaugural chair of the Reston YMCA 
Board of Directors, and executive director of Habitat for Humanity of 
Northern Virginia. She also previously served on the Wolf Trap 
Foundation Board of Directors, supporting the only national park 
dedicated to presenting the performing art.
  On behalf of our grateful community, I wish Karen, her husband, Jim, 
and their family all the best as she embarks on her next chapter.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in expressing our 
appreciation for Karen Cleveland&#x27;s commitment to helping our community 
reflect the LFI motto to lead, unite, and thrive.

                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 12 New 
Hampshire individuals

[[Page E1215]]

for their recent act of bravery in the Town of Alton. When a man&#x27;s jet 
ski began to sink into the frigid November waters of Lake 
Winnipesaukee, seven New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) 
employees and five Top Notch Tree Service employees stepped in to save 
the man from drowning. I commend the NHDOT workers and the Top Notch 
Tree Team, as well as the EMS response crew, for their efforts to 
rescue the man and provide him with needed care.
  While removing an old dock from the Alton shoreline, the team of good 
samaritans heard screams and cries for help from the water. As soon as 
the workers discovered that a man on a jet ski was sinking deeper into 
the lake, they jumped into action. Some rescuers ran to Sandy Point 
Beach Resort to secure a kayak and canoe to row to the man, others 
called 911 and urged him to continue swimming. When the kayaker reached 
the sinking jet ski, the drowning man latched onto the rescuer&#x27;s kayak 
and was paddled to shore. Although the man was initially unresponsive 
when brought to shore, hard-working EMS personnel quickly revived him.
  The NHDOT and Top Notch Tree teams&#x27; quick and effective response to 
the situation is a result of their empathy, brilliance, and sound 
judgment. By acting quickly and delegating responsibilities, the 
rescuers were able to reach the man and save him before it was too 
late. I commend these individuals for demonstrating a calculated and 
successful save in a difficult situation.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I want to thank these selfless and courageous individuals. 
Let their courage and heroism serve as an example for us all.

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Staff Sergeant 
Willie A. Curtis, U.S. Army, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation. 
His excellent service to both the Army and his local community is a 
shining example of citizenship and commitment to duty.
  During SSG Curtis&#x27;s 20+ years of service to the United States Army, 
he went above and beyond to serve his country. Due to his extensive 
period serving our country, he earned many awards such as the Army 
Commendation Medal, an Army Achievement Medal, and a National Defense 
Service Medal, among other medals, decorations, and badges.
  Upon retirement, SSG Curtis settled in Taylor, Texas. An eternal 
optimist, he has an enormous heart and an endless capacity to 
contribute his time, energy, and resources to assist local students, 
the homeless, and first responders. Whether it&#x27;s organizing public 
music events or celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., SSG 
Curtis is renowned as a man unafraid to do the hard work to do good for 
his neighbors.
  When I reflect on SSG Curtis&#x27; life of service over the years, I am 
reminded of the teachings of Christ when he taught, ``Whatever you did 
for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for 
me.&#x27;&#x27; To SSG Curtis, these are not mere words but a summons by which to 
live a fulfilling life. He is a fitting recipient of a Congressional 
Veteran Commendation.

                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023

  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize B. Dan Berger as 
he prepares to step down from his role at the President/CEO of the 
National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU) at the 
end of the year.
  Dan first joined NAFCU in 2006 and helped the association become a 
strong advocate for credit unions in Washington. I have had the 
pleasure of working with Dan on several issues before the Financial 
Services Committee during that time.
  Dan became the President/CEO of NAFCU in 2013. In a decade under his 
leadership. NAFCU has grown its membership by nearly 50 percent, while 
increasing assets and revenue. His final act for NAFCU will be leading 
it into a merger with the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) to 
create a new voice for credit unions--America&#x27;s Credit Unions.
  Dan earned a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Harvard 
University and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from The 
Florida State University. He is a member of The Economic Club of 
Washington, DC, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Committee of 100, and was 
an adjunct professor at The George Washington University in the 
communications department. He also serves as Vice Chair of the 
conservation group Bonefish and Tarpon Trust and formerly served as 
Chair of The Florida State University Alumni Association.
  I know the credit union community will miss Dan as he heads back to 
Florida to spend more time with his wife Aimee and daughter Shelby. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dan Berger and wishing 
him the best of luck with whatever comes next.

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a doting 
wife, devoted mother, and darling matriarch to many on her 104th 
birthday. Mrs. Ethel Hamilton Kelly of Charleston, South Carolina, will 
celebrate this milestone surrounded by family and friends on December 
16, 2023. We joyfully celebrate her longevity.
  Ethel Hamilton was born in 1919 in Colleton County, South Carolina, 
and was raised along with six siblings. She was joined in holy 
matrimony to lsiah Kelly, and together they had ten children. While 
Isiah worked various jobs, Ethel remained home to care for her large 
family. She instilled in all her children the importance of kindness 
and the ability to respectfully resolve disagreements with others. In 
addition to caring for her own children, Ethel regularly fed other 
children that frequented her home.
  Ethel and Isiah raised all their children to be faithful servants of 
God. The Ten Commandments guide Ethel&#x27;s life, and she believes adhering 
to them is of principal importance.
  As Ms. Hamilton Kelly celebrates her 104th birthday, she remains in 
good health and retains her sharp mind. She continues to follow current 
events and votes in nearly every election. Her eight surviving 
children, twenty-two grandchildren, two sisters, and numerous other

  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in celebrating 
the remarkable life of Ethel Hamilton Kelly. She continues to display 
her boundless maternal love to her family and others every day. We 
congratulate her on a life well lived and wish her continued good 
health and happiness in the days to come.

                    TRIBUTE TO GABRIEL LEE SHAW, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GWEN MOORE

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 12, 2023

  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life and service of Gabriel (Gabe) Lee Shaw, Jr., a dedicated 
individual, a family-oriented man, a lifelong learner, and one of my 
dearest friends. I fondly referred to him as my ``brother-in-love,&#x27;&#x27; it 
saddens me to say that Gabe passed peacefully on Thursday, December 7, 
2023, with his beloved wife of 41 years, Shirley Ellis, District 
Director of Wisconsin&#x27;s 4th Congressional District by his side. The 
breadth of Gabe&#x27;s accomplishments far exceeds his 78 years.
  Gabe was born in Osceola, Arkansas, into the loving union of Gabriel 
Lee Shaw and Mary Hall Shaw. Gabe&#x27;s life began as the first son among 
eight children, including five daughters and three sons. Graduating 
from North Division High School in 1963, he embarked on a path of hard 
work and continuous learning, which led him to proudly join the United 
States Air Force at the age of 17 the same year.
  His dedication was evident as he graduated from the U.S. Air Force 
Explosive Ordinance Disposal School at Eglin AFB in Florida. Gabe&#x27;s 
military service was exceptional, marked by holding one of the highest 
security clearances during the Vietnam era, concluding with an 
honorable discharge in 1968. Gabe&#x27;s work ethic and commitment to detail 
became a hallmark of his character. He often declared, ``you cannot 
talk work done,&#x27;&#x27; demonstrating his resolve to address and solve any 
challenge thrown his way. Following his military service, his pursuit 
of knowledge persisted, leading him to enroll in both UW-Platteville 
and UW-Milwaukee with a focus on mathematics. His passion for cars 
propelled him to become an Automotive Service Excellence Certified 
technician.
  Known for his love of challenges, Gabe accomplished the remarkable 
feat of passing all eight comprehensive exams required for the 
Automotive Excellence certificate on his first attempt, maintaining 
this certification for an impressive 15 years. He later attended 
Milwaukee Area Technical College and became a certified Air 
Conditioning and Heating Specialist. Gabe retired from Miller Brewing 
Company in 2005 after 30 years of service. His illustrious 30-year 
tenure at Miller Brewing Company showcased his dedication and loyalty.
  Gabe, son of a carpenter, had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge 
that extended to various subjects, including taxes, carpentry, 
electrical work, masonry, and heating/cooling. This extensive expertise 
paved the way for his successful career, culminating in becoming a 
licensed Real Estate Broker in 1977. With a wealth of knowledge, Gabe 
thrived as a property owner. His ability to repair and maintain 
properties enabled him to support his family and community. He bailed 
out countless people with home and auto repairs operating as a 
contractor under the telling banner of GOOD AND FAIR.
  Gabe&#x27;s four daughters, son and grandchildren all benefited from his 
talent, intelligence, love, and generosity. In the weeks before his 
death, Gabe shared with me a message to all our progeny. ``Don&#x27;t make 
excuses, if you work hard, look forward and not backwards you can 
accomplish anything with just an average aptitude.&#x27;&#x27; Gabe shared his 
life with his beloved wife, business partner and best friend, Shirley 
A. Ellis, who for over 41 years supported each other in health and 
sickness, exemplifying a dynamic and supportive partnership.
  Gabe&#x27;s role as a great provider extended beyond his immediate family, 
as he generously shared his wisdom with mentees, especially young men, 
offering valuable insights into the trade.
  Personally, Gabriel supported me during some of the most challenging 
times of my life. My brother-in-love was a comforting resource for me 
as an 18-year-old new parent, as a candidate without a dime to donate 
to my own campaign, as a ``handy&#x27;&#x27; friend who rescued me time and time 
again as a new homeowner of an old house.
  Mr. Speaker, Gabriel Lee Shaw, Jr., was a cherished member of 
Milwaukee, the 4th Congressional District, and the entire State of 
Wisconsin. He is an example of how patriotism, hard work, lifelong 
learning, and kindness can create a fulfilling life,
  I will always treasure his personal impact on me, and I rise to honor 
the late Gabriel L. Shaw, Jr.
