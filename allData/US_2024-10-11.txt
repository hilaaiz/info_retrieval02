          CELEBRATING BUTLER MEMORIAL UNITED METHODIST CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RITCHIE TORRES

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I want to celebrate a 
Northeast Bronx staple, Butler Memorial United Methodist Church, a 
place that has continued to be a center of community and worship for 
more than 100 years. The Butler congregation initially met at the 
Williamsbridge Colored Men&#x27;s Association in 1912. The service was led 
by Reverend Gilbert Wilson.
  After years of community service, the Church&#x27;s membership increased, 
the church school had outgrown the available space, and expansion was 
urgently needed to the needs of the community. In 1961 the Church broke 
ground on their current location, and in 1962 the congregation marched 
to the new Church. In November of that year, the congregation held the 
cornerstone laying service in their new house of worship.
  As the congregation continued to grow, so too did the services 
provided by Butler. In 1981, the Church established a scholarship 
program to assist community youth, later other additional scholarships 
were offered. The church began offering Thanksgiving services, and 8 
a.m. services to accommodate increased parishioners. Butler added more 
programming for community members including a weekly newsletter, bible 
study classes, an additional choir, and a Nurses&#x27; unit.
  In 1995, Butler began its expansion program to provide services to 
individuals across the Borough. After years of careful planning and 
hard work, Butler broke ground on their new educational facility in 
2012. The groundbreaking was followed by a 12 years of dedication and 
hard work to provide this service to the community. Under the 
leadership of Reverend Dr. Allen Pickney, Butler&#x27;s 10th pastor, Butler 
completed the final phase of their expansion project, their Butler 
Memorial United Methodist Church Educational Wing.
  I want to say thank you to the entire Butler community for providing 
spiritual, physical, and educational support to families around the 
Bronx. I look forward to hearing about the Church&#x27;s future successes.

                          ____________________

  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the successes of 
Chieftain Elementary School in Logan, Ohio, as they were recognized as 
a National Blue Ribbon School for 2024.
  I have had the privilege of visiting the Logan-Hocking school 
district and the compassion and care the teachers, staff, and 
administrators, have for their students always stands out.
  They are committed not just to the academic success of their 
students, but also to caring deeply about the well-being of each and 
every one of their students. They are invested in the success of their 
students because they know it will result in the success of their 
community.
  A happy and healthy student is a student who is ready to succeed. I 
want to thank the talented teachers and staff for their dedication to 
Ohio&#x27;s youth and I commend Chieftain Elementary on this incredible 
recognition.

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Breast 
Cancer Awareness Month and join the Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation 
in celebrating the unveiling of the BIG hope sculpture by Chicago 
artist Matthew Hoffman.
  Breast cancer is the second most common cancer present in women in 
the United States. Over the course of 2024, it is expected that about 
310,720 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women, 
and about 42,250 women will die from breast cancer. These numbers are 
far too high.
  Since 1985, the Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation has led the fight 
against breast cancer, raising funds for breast cancer research and 
doctors in the Chicagoland area. This organization is named for Lynn 
Sage who died at only 39 years old as a result of her breast cancer. 
The Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation provides funding for research 
grants and fellowships. The organization also holds the annual Lynn 
Sage Breast Cancer Symposium which assembles breast cancer research 
leaders from across the world. The BIG hope sculpture is yet another 
example of their dedication to raising awareness of the fight against 
breast cancer. This sculpture serves as a symbol of hope for those 
impacted by the disease, and it will raise funds which will support the 
Chicago Breast Cancer Research Consortium.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me and all our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives in recognizing the work of the Lynn Sage Breast Cancer 
Foundation and congratulating them on the unveiling of this artwork.

     COMMEMORATING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF POLISH AMERICAN CONGRESS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the 80th 
Anniversary of the Polish American Congress, which was established by 
over 2,600 individuals and representatives of Polish organizations in 
Buffalo on May 28, 1944, just days before the Normandy Invasion.
  The purpose of the Polish American Congress was to fight for a free 
and sovereign Poland which had been attacked in 1939 by Nazi Germany, 
the Slovak Army, and by the Soviet Union.
  As a result of the Second World War, Poland lost between five and 11 
million people due to the genocide committed by the occupying forces 
and border changes.
  After the Yalta Conference of 1945, Poland fell under communist rule 
and lost 20 percent of its territory. It was then that the Polish 
American Congress was founded and committed itself to helping the 
Polish nation.
  The achievements of the Polish American Congress include:
       1948: advocacy for legislation that allowed 140,000 Polish 
     displaced persons and veterans of the Polish armed forces, 
     who fought against Nazi Germany, to settle permanently in the 
     U.S.
       1950: supporting the creation of Radio Free Europe as a 
     voice of truth for the people of Eastern Europe.
       1952: pressuring the House of Representatives to 
     investigate the Katyn Forest Massacre. The investigation 
     found that the Soviet Union was responsible for the mass 
     execution of Polish military officers in World War II.
       1980s: support for Solidarity, a movement that eventually 
     contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the fall 
     of communism in Poland in 1989.
       1999: support for Poland&#x27;s admission into NATO, signed and 
     supported by President Bill Clinton.
       2019: successful conclusion of the multi-year lobbying 
     effort to include Poles in the Visa Waiver Program.
       2022: raising thousands of dollars for the Polish Red Cross 
     and Ukrainian Relief efforts to welcome over one million 
     Ukrainian refugees into Poland in response to Russia&#x27;s war of 
     aggression against Ukraine.

  The bond between the United States and Poland dates back to the 
Revolutionary War.
  Casimir Pulaski, known as the `Father of the American Cavalry&#x27;, was a 
leading commander in the South and died in the 1799 Battle of Savannah. 
Andrew Kosciusko was a colonel in the Continental Army, a military 
architect credited with the construction of fortifications at West 
Point in New York, and a close friend of Thomas Jefferson who dedicated 
his U.S. assets to the education and freedom of American slaves.
  Millions of Poles have since emigrated to the United States. During 
the Industrial Revolution, Polish immigrants contributed enormously to 
the economic flourishing of this country. Polish values and culture, 
like the love of freedom, hard work, hospitality, and pride in family 
and community, are woven throughout the fabric of America.
  Throughout its 80 year history, the Polish American Congress has 
remained committed to its mission: A free and sovereign Poland. I 
congratulate this organization, which advocates for the nearly ten 
million Americans of Polish descent. The Polish American Congress will 
meet this weekend in Chicago to celebrate its history of 
accomplishments, and I wish it many more decades of success as it plans 
for the future.

              GOLD STAR SPOUSE HEALTHCARE ENHANCEMENT ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARCY KAPTUR

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the immense debt our 
Nation owes to the surviving family of servicemembers killed defending 
US interests and the cause of Liberty abroad. Today, I am joined in 
bipartisan fashion by Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska in introducing 
a bill that recognizes their sacrifice by expanding healthcare benefits 
for Gold Star spouses.
  Currently, surviving spouses retain healthcare coverage through 
TRICARE in the ``active-duty family member&#x27;&#x27; category for just three 
years after their servicemember passes away. After three years, they 
automatically shift to ``retired family member&#x27;&#x27; status, which forces 
them to pay higher fees and out-of-pocket costs.
  The debt our Nation owes to the brave men and women who make the 
ultimate sacrifice while serving overseas is not a debt that can be 
repaid within three years. It is our sacred responsibility to honor 
their sacrifice by caring for their surviving spouses.
  It is in this spirit that Representative Bacon and I are proud to 
introduce the bipartisan Gold Star Spouses Healthcare Enhancement Act. 
This Act effectively removes the three-year limitation for spouses who 
meet criteria for the Gold Star lapel button. It enables them to remain 
in ``active-duty family member&#x27;&#x27; status, reducing the costs and burden 
on those who have already sacrificed so much for our country.
  Military service requires our young men and women to risk their lives 
fighting and defeating America&#x27;s enemies. They selflessly accept this 
risk to secure Liberty across the globe. I encourage each of my 
colleagues to support the Gold Star Spouses Healthcare Enhancement Act 
as one small way to honor the debt we as a Nation owe those who 
answered the call to service and perished in defense of our Nation.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
woman, a true american hero, and a beloved member of the Montrose, 
Colorado, community--Betty Jeanne Hayes. Today, Betty celebrates her 
100th birthday, and I can think of no better way to mark this occasion 
than by recognizing her lifelong dedication to service, during World 
War II and throughout her years in our community.
  Betty Hayes embodies the courage and resilience of the `Greatest 
Generation.&#x27; In the early 1940s, when our country faced one of its 
darkest hours, Betty answered the call as a `Rosie the Riveter.&#x27; At 
North American Aviation in Kansas City, she worked to build B-25 
bombers, aircraft that played a crucial role in the war effort. Betty 
and women like her stepped into roles that were then unconventional, 
taking on tasks vital to our Nation&#x27;s success. For nearly two years, 
she worked diligently, earning 95 cents an hour and, more importantly, 
earning the gratitude of a Nation. Her contributions enabled our 
servicemen, including her own husband, Rudy Neill, to serve on the 
front lines. When Rudy returned, deeply affected by the war, Betty 
stood by him, raising their three children with love and determination.
  After the war, Betty continued her commitment to service. She worked 
at TWA in the accounting department, applying the same care she brought 
to her wartime work. Even after retiring over 30 years ago, she found 
new ways to serve.
  Since moving to Montrose, Betty has become a pillar of the community, 
volunteering with organizations like Christ&#x27;s Kitchen, Shepherd&#x27;s Hand, 
and Region 10. At 100, she still gives her time to the Warrior Resource 
Center every Monday. Her warmth, kindness, and dedication to veterans 
have made her invaluable to the Center. As Amy Eifling, the volunteer 
coordinator, put it: `She is sweet, has kind words, and is uplifting. 
She makes all of us better.&#x27;
  Betty&#x27;s service hasn&#x27;t gone unnoticed. This year, she was named Woman 
of the Year at the Women of Distinction event, reflecting the deep 
respect she commands. Her daughter, Sherry Neill, calls her a role 
model and pioneer--one of those women who stepped up during a time of 
need and never stopped serving.
  Mr. Speaker, Betty Hayes is more than a volunteer, more than a `Rosie 
the Riveter,&#x27; and more than a centenarian. She is a shining example of 
the best of America. Her story is one of selflessness, resilience, and 
unending generosity. On behalf of this Congress, I wish Betty a very 
happy 100th birthday. We honor her for her lifetime of service and 
thank her for reminding us all what it means to serve with humility, 
strength, and grace.

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of New Hampshire&#x27;s 
2025 Teacher of the Year, Candice DeAngelis. For 18 years, Candice has 
dedicated her life to being an educator and creating a real impact on 
the lives of students who come through her classroom. She represents 
all of what it means to be an amazing teacher: compassionate, friendly, 
and a lifelong learner.
  From the beginning of Candice&#x27;s career teaching Spanish in 
Londonderry and Kingston to now at Bedford High School, she has always 
cared deeply about her students. Her students are always excited to go 
to her class because she makes learning a new language fun and 
exciting. She always has a smile on her face and is not only ready to 
teach her students but is also ready to learn from them.
  The care and dedication that Candice has for her students comes down 
to an individual level. She always makes an effort to get to know them 
beyond just learning their name. Understanding how each of her students 
learn is an important step in getting them to understand a new 
language. Candice also works to create lasting memories with her 
students that will stick with them long after they leave her class.
  On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I congratulate Candice for being named New Hampshire&#x27;s 2025 
Teacher of the Year. I wish Candice, her family, and her students all 
the best in the years to come as she continues dedicating her life to 
education.

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;m honored to recognize Corporal (Army, 
Retired) Richard Deppen on the auspicious occasion of his 100th 
birthday on October 21, 2024.
  Richard Deppen born on October 21, 1924, was a part of the ``Greatest

Deppen served from April 1943 through the end of the war in 1945--
serving with the 182nd Ordnance Depot Company attached to the Third 
Army under General Patton in the European campaign. His sacrifice and 
the others, enables our Freedom as a Nation today--and we owe them all 
a debt that cannot be repaid.
  After his honorable military career, Corporal Deppen graduated from 
Pennsylvania State in 1950 with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Agronomy. Then 
being called back to service, Mr. Deppen earned a position at The 
Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture--which he served in for

[[Page E1029]]

over 30 years--retiring in 1990 as Chief of the Seed Division. Mr. 
Deppen astoundingly still maintains his independence in Mechanicsburg, 
Pennsylvania and is a blessing to his family and all those that have 
the privilege of sharing his company.
  Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;m honored, privileged, and humbled to recognize 
Corporal (Army, Retired) Richard Deppen on his 100th birthday. His 
tireless, faithful, and selfless service to the Nation and our 
Commonwealth sets the standard by which we all should be judged. I wish 
him continued Godspeed.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Dr. 
Albert Leon McHenry, who we lost at the age of 83 on September 9, 2024. 
A life-long educator and academic, Dr. McHenry&#x27;s contributions to 
advancing engineering technology education will continue to live on 
through the countless lives he positively impacted.
  Albert was born in Ruston, Louisiana to Albert Augusta, a school 
principal and respected community leader, and Irma Giles McHenry, a 
homemaker and a devoted mother renowned for her Southern cooking and 
tireless community service. As a student, Albert excelled in academics 
and extracurriculars--graduating as Class President and Salutatorian, 
competing as a soloist in concert choir and playing baseball, all while 
serving as mentor to his younger siblings Clyde and Hattie.
  With many academic avenues closed in the segregated South, Albert 
began his college education at Southern University in Baton Rouge, an 
HBCU, where, after being inspired by the advent of the Space Race, he 
changed his major from chemistry after one semester to Electronics 
Engineering and Technology. Albert excelled in college, serving as 
chapter president of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. He graduated in June of 
1962 and accepted a position with Boeing&#x27;s Saturn Rocket Booster Branch 
in New Orleans, and married the love of his life, Annette Bostick, in 
December of that year. Their marriage was blessed with two

[[Page E1027]]

daughters, Janet and Joan, to whom Albert was a wise and devoted 
father, just as his father had been to him.
  He taught in the Electronics Department at Southern University for 
more than a decade before Albert and Annette decided to further their 
academic credentials at Arizona State University in Tempe. Albert 
earned his M.S. in Technology in 1976 and a Ph.D. in 1980, and was 
quickly offered a permanent position as Associate Professor. The family 
put down permanent roots in Mesa, where Albert would call home for the 
rest of his life. One of only a small handful of Black professors at 
ASU, Dr. McHenry quickly rose through the ranks to become the 
university&#x27;s Dean of Technology. Under his leadership, enrollment in 
the college rose by 55 percent.
  In the mid-1990s, ASU undertook an ambitious plan to convert the 
recently closed Williams Air Force Base into a new campus which would 
later become ASU Polytechnic. Dr. McHenry became one of ASU Poly&#x27;s two 
founding Deans, creating and directing the College of Technology and 
Applied Sciences in Southeast Mesa, which continues to thrive. He 
retired in 2008, having risen to Executive Vice Provost and Vice 
President. Dr. McHenry was great at many things, but being retired 
wasn&#x27;t one of them, so he continued to serve the university as a part-
time Research Professor Emeritus at the Hispanic Research Center until 
2022.
  Dr. McHenry was just as accomplished and impactful in his community 
service as he was in academia. He was a charter member of the Gamma Mu 
Boule of Phoenix, served on the Mesa United Way and Mesa Senior 
Services boards, chaired the technology committee for the East Valley 
Partnership. He was named the 2003 Mesa Man of the Year and presented 
the East Valley Partnership also Dwight Patterson Lifetime Achievement 
Award. His lifetime love of music let him to form the McHenry Singers, 
a family gospel group that preformed at numerous community events.
  Arizona owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. McHenry for his years of 
service to our community. Thank you, and Godspeed.

                  HONORING THE LEGACY OF WES SELVIDGE

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the indomitable spirit 
and extraordinary life of Wes Selvidge; a true icon whose legacy 
transcends the ordinary. Born on August 8, 1942, Wes was not just a 
man; he was a force of nature, embodying the essence of California&#x27;s 
oldest ranching traditions.
  Raised amidst the vast expanse of the Tracy Ranch in Buttonwillow, 
Wes lived and breathed the farming life, etching his name alongside 
pioneers. In 1971, he co-founded the Buttonwillow Land and Cattle 
Company, a testament to his enduring commitment to the land that shaped 
him. Wes&#x27;s agricultural prowess, keen intellect, and unyielding desire 
to learn elevated him to the ranks of respected growers, contributing 
significantly to the diverse crops he cultivated.
  Wes&#x27;s influence extended far beyond the fields. Engaging in a rich 
tapestry of activities, he raced motorcycles and cars, soared the skies 
on hang gliders, worked cattle with ranching comrades, and piloted 
planes and helicopters with a natural finesse. A licensed pilot since 
his teenage years, Wes not only competed nationally in aerobatic 
competitions but also treated countless individuals to their maiden 
flights.
  His love for speed wasn&#x27;t confined to the air; it translated to the 
ground with a passion for cars. From a Model A hot rod built at age 14 
to a collection of meticulously restored vehicles, Wes&#x27;s mechanical 
acumen was impressive. Beyond these adventures, Wes was a craftsman and 
a restorer. His dedication to restoring sunken boats from the depths of 
Lake Tahoe showcased not just his skills but his determination to turn 
forgotten treasures into award-winning beauties.
  Wes faced over 18 years of health challenges with a resilience that 
mirrored his zest for life. Throughout this journey, his steadfast 
partner of 59 years, Janet, stood by his side, a testament to a love 
that weathered the storms.
  In Wes&#x27;s passing, we celebrate a life that embraced adventure, 
challenged norms, and left an indelible mark on all who were fortunate 
enough to know him. His legacy lives on in his family: his wife Janet, 
daughter Andrea, son Jason, and, undoubtedly his proudest achievement, 
his four grandsons--John, Clay, Owen, and Zachary. May we draw 
inspiration from Wes Selvidge&#x27;s enduring spirit and the richness of a 
life well-lived. I extend my deepest condolences to his family, 
friends, and all who mourn the loss of this remarkable Californian.
  Mr. Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in paying 
tribute to the memory of Wes Selvidge, a true Californian and 
inspiration to the Central Valley.

                  HONORING THE LIFE OF CHRIS SORENSEN

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Chris 
Sorensen, who passed away on Friday, March 8, 2024. Mr. Sorensen was an 
artist in Fresno who founded the city&#x27;s beloved ArtHop, bringing 
artists and the community together to share and enjoy the talent and 
creativity that Fresno&#x27;s residents have to offer.
  Mr. Sorensen was born on June 30, 1925, in Fresno, CA. He grew up in 
Mendota, CA before moving to Fresno where he graduated from Fresno High 
School in 1944. After graduating, he served our country and joined the 
U.S. Navy during World War II. When he came back home, he worked at his 
family&#x27;s machine works business in Mendota until he moved back to 
Fresno and started WECO, a welding supply business.
  Art was not Mr. Sorensen&#x27;s initial career. Prior to his legacy as an 
artist, he had been a draftsman, inventor, a partner in farm equipment 
and manufacturing, and a welder. His interest and career in art started 
because of his son, John, who took an art class at McLane High School 
and asked him for help with welding. After that, Mr. Sorensen took art 
classes as well--kickstarting his legendary career as one of Fresno&#x27;s 
most revered artists.
  Sorensen&#x27;s impact extended beyond his beautiful sculptures when he 
began the Chris Sorensen Studio in the early 1990s. This studio brought 
artists in Fresno together to work on their art, providing the original 
home for Fresno&#x27;s ArtHop. Now, ArtHop is spread out through multiple 
locations in the city and is held on the first and third Thursday of 
every month, providing a space for the community to come together to 
appreciate and enjoy the work of our local artists. Sorensen&#x27;s gallery 
and art studio has been proclaimed the ``The Heart of Art in Fresno,&#x27;&#x27; 
bringing together artists for more than 30 years.
  His specialty in welding landed him the nickname of ``Man of Steel,&#x27;&#x27; 
as he became known for his large metal sculptures. His impressive 
sculptures and artistic prowess can be witnessed throughout the Valley, 
including a massive heart at St. Agnes Hospital, a metal tree on Friant 
Road, a life size mammoth in Madera, and a bulldog at his welding 
company, WECO.
  Mr. Sorensen has also demonstrated his generosity and dedication to 
the arts extensively in his time. He has organized a fundraiser for the 
Mariposa Arts Council when they lost their headquarters in a fire, put 
on an annual Pink Show to raise money for breast cancer research, 
supported the Timberline Gallery in Oakhurst in keeping their gallery 
open, among many other instances of philanthropy.
  Chris was a loving husband to Mitzi Christensen and loving father to 
their two children, Vicki and John. He was also a grandfather and 
great-grandfather to 7 great-grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Chris 
Sorensen for his dedication and achievements in advocating for local 
artists and bringing the community together. May we never forget his 
contributions and continue to be inspired by his legacy.

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Sally M. 
Caglia, whose commitment to maintaining her family&#x27;s commercial legacy 
and philanthropic contributions has left an indelible mark in her 
community.
  Born on April 20, 1947, Sally inherited the Italian work ethic, 
ingenuity, and family devotion from her Caglia lineage. These values 
aligned well with her upbringing as Sally seized her opportunities and 
became the women, we all knew and loved, one who devoted her life to 
her family, her work, and traveling.
  The family business was Sally&#x27;s pride and joy. Starting at a young 
age as a cashier at Orange Avenue Disposal and working as the Executive 
Assistant at the Electric Motor Shop, Sally worked tirelessly to ensure 
the viability and success of the Caglia family&#x27;s commercial legacy.
  Sally will be fondly remembered by all who knew her for her 
adventurous spirit; a passion for travel, fishing, and the arts; her 
devoted civic engagement; and for her love of leopard print and 
turquoise jewelry.
  Sally was an avid traveler and some of her most memorable trips were 
to Australia, India, and Tanzania. She went with The Rotary Club to 
Israel and to Palestine with the Catholic Church. She visited 
Antarctica with the National Geographic ship. She traveled all over the 
world to be with her globetrotting children and grandchildren.
  Quick to laugh and always smiling, Sally never met a stranger. She 
hosted numerous foreign exchange students and wayward travelers. She 
was an avid supporter of higher educational pursuits of many local and 
international students.
  The dedication to her family business reached its pinnacle when she 
was awarded the Leon S. Peters Award issued to business leaders who 
embody the spirit of service, community engagement, and the 
philanthropy of its namesake. Sally was tremendously honored to have 
been the third member of her family to receive the award and often said 
that she just couldn&#x27;t believe it. There was no greater joy for her 
than being recognized for following in the footsteps of her beloved 
brother, Dick Caglia, and her father, Frank Caglia.
  Sally&#x27;s legacy is one shared with family, but her qualities as an 
individual were uniquely her own. Beyond her professional 
accomplishments, she was involved in countless local and international 
organizations, charities, boards, and fund-raisers including the 
Cultural Arts Rotary Club, Cultural Arts District Association, Fresno/
Clovis Convention and Visitors Bureau Research and Development Board, 
the Fresno Chamber of Commerce, the City of Fresno Historic 
Preservation Commission, the Warnor&#x27;s Center for the Performing Arts, 
Storyland and Jazz, the Shenzen Stroll, St. John&#x27;s Cathedral annual 
carnival, the Italian museum at Fresno State, and the St. Elia 
Festival, to name only a few.
  In her community, Sally will be remembered not only as a successful 
businesswoman and friend but also as a compassionate and caring 
individual. She touched the lives of many with her kindness, warmth, 
and willingness to lend a helping hand.
  Sally has finally reunited with her parents Frank and Florence Caglia 
and her brother Joseph Caglia. Still, she is survived by her loving 
family including her four children, Noelle Iles, John Hester, Rebecca 
Darche Hester, and Andrea Olsen; her five grandchildren, India Iles, 
Ella Iles, Jack Hester, Jean Baptiste Hester-Dorbe and Sophia Hester-
Dorbe; her siblings Dick Caglia, Vince Caglia, Mary Ann Caglia, 
Bernadette Boyle, and Rose Caglia, and countless cousins, and nieces 
and nephews.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
lifelong contributions of Sally M. Caglia to her family, and the Fresno 
community. May her story serve as an inspiration to us all.

                      RECOGNIZING JORGE RODRIGUEZ

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETH VAN DUYNE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
extraordinary contributions of Jorge Rodriguez. Originally from Rio 
Piedras, Puerto Rico, he has called Grapevine his home since 1995. 
Jorge&#x27;s passion for education and unwavering commitment to his 
community has made a lasting impact on the Grapevine-Colleyville 
Independent School District. For 15 years, Jorge served as an elected 
member of the Grapevine-Colleyville ISD Board of Trustees, where his 
leadership and vision played a pivotal role in elevating the district&#x27;s 
academic performance. Under his stewardship, Grapevine-Colleyville ISD 
achieved the distinguished rank of sixth in Texas for its advanced 
studies program, a reflection of his dedication to fostering academic 
excellence and creating opportunities for all students.

[[Page E1030]]

  Jorge&#x27;s leadership was further highlighted in 2018 when the 
Grapevine-Colleyville ISD Board was awarded the Texas School Board of 
the Year, an honor that speaks to his forward-thinking approach and 
commitment to education. His contributions have left an indelible mark 
on the district, shaping its future and enhancing the educational 
experience for countless students. In addition to his work on the 
school board, Jorge founded the Exito Hispano program in 2011, a 
groundbreaking initiative aimed at empowering Hispanic parents through 
educational workshops. These workshops provide essential information 
about public school programs, scholarships, universities, and academic 
opportunities, helping to bridge gaps and ensure that all Hispanic 
students in Grapevine-Colleyville ISD have the tools to graduate and 
pursue higher education.
  Jorge Rodriguez&#x27;s efforts to expand educational opportunities, 
empower Latino families, and promote youth development have made him a 
true champion for progress, inclusion, and a brighter future for all in 
Grapevine and the Hispanic community.
  It is my pleasure to recognize Jorge Rodriguez for his exemplary 
contributions and unwavering dedication to North Texas, as well as 
congratulate him on receiving the 2024 Latino Service Award.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY STUDY 
                               INSTITUTE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 11, 2024

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) on its 40th 
anniversary. Since its inception, EESI has steadfastly worked to 
provide policymakers with timely, relevant, educational resources about 
environmental, clean energy, and climate topics. Through seven 
presidential administrations throughout its forty-year history, EESI 
has remained dedicated to its mission and providing much needed 
information to better the lives of Americans across our country.
  The story of EESI begins in the 1970s when a bipartisan group of 
members of Congress--led by then-Rep. Richard L. ``Dick&#x27;&#x27; Ottinger--
established the Environmental and Energy Study Conference to help 
policymakers understand sustainability issues that were gaining in 
importance on Capitol Hill. By 1984, the Conference had evolved into an 
independent nonprofit organization: EESI.
  As climate, clean energy, and environmental challenges have become 
more complicated and more urgent over the years, EESI has produced 
briefings, articles, fact sheets, issue briefs, and podcasts that 
clearly explain and synthesize issues for policymakers, with an 
emphasis on Congressional staff, while remaining objective and 
nonpartisan.
  Moreso, I have the privilege of serving as a co-chair of the 
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, which highlights, on a 
bipartisan basis, the many benefits of clean energy. Each year, EESI 
works with House and Senate Caucus leadership to organize the 
Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency EXPO and Policy 
Forum. Dozens of leaders, experts, and practitioners descend on Capitol 
Hill to exhibit their solutions and raise awareness of how clean energy 
is creating good-paying jobs, promoting environmental justice, 
expanding economic development in rural communities, and contributing 
to national security and resilience. Now in its 27th year, the EXPO and 
Policy Forum is firmly established as an essential showcase and venue 
for policymaker education.
  Many congratulations to EESI on 40 impactful years on Capitol Hill. 
As my colleagues in Congress and I consider new policies and 
investments to meet the climate challenges of today and tomorrow, I 
have no doubt that EESI will continue to be an essential resource and 
eager partner. On behalf of the United States Congress and Missouri&#x27;s 
Fifth District, I applaud EESI for 40 years of achievements and I look 
forward to the years of success to come.

                          ____________________
