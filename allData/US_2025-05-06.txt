              CELEBRATING TRINIDAD GOMEZ&#x27;S 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PETE AGUILAR

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 6, 2025

  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 100th 
birthday of Ms. Trinidad ``Trini&#x27;&#x27; Gomez, a constituent and friend who 
has led an incredible life and made our community better and brighter 
for everyone who crossed her path.
  Born in Gallup, New Mexico, in 1925 as the eldest of 12 children, 
Trini was no stranger to hard work. From learning English so she could 
attend school, to joining the railroad industry alongside other women 
during World War II, to becoming the sole breadwinner for her household 
following her husband&#x27;s passing, Trini Gomez never met a challenge she 
could not overcome.
  As a San Bernardino resident. Trini has had a profound impact on the 
Inland Empire&#x27;s culture and history. In 1986, Trini and her late 
husband, Graciano Gomez, founded the Inland Empire Hispanic News, a 
newspaper that aimed to advocate for the greater Hispanic community in 
the region. The publication quickly became the largest-circulated 
English-language community newspaper in the Inland Empire and had a 
lasting impact on the community. The Inland Empire Hispanic News 
provided a platform for Hispanic voices, shed light on important 
political and activist issues and recognized the achievements and 
contributions of the Hispanic community. After 23 years of service, the 
archive of the publication became an indispensable record of Mexican 
American history in the Inland Empire.
  Today, I wish Trini Gomez a happy birthday and thank her for her 
dedication to and love for the Inland Empire and the people who call it 
home. I hope all of us can pay tribute to her achievements and the 
profound impact she has had on countless people. May the coming year 
bring Trini good health, happiness and time spent with loved ones.

                          ____________________

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 6, 2025

  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Kim A. 
Wilcox on his tenure as the ninth chancellor of UC Riverside. Since 
2013, he has led the university through a remarkable transformation, 
turning UCR into a national model for student success and social 
mobility.
  Dr. Wilcox&#x27;s vision brought bold expansion in research, enrollment, 
graduation rates, and campus development. He guided the creation of the 
Schools of Medicine and Public Policy, grew enrollment by over 25 
percent, and championed faculty diversity. His efforts resulted in over 
2 million square feet of new academic, residential, and dining space.
  A passionate advocate for access and equity, Chancellor Wilcox has 
made UC Riverside a hub of scientific innovation and has brought future 
innovators to the Inland Empire.
  Chancellor Wilcox has been a partner and friend to my office during 
his tenure, and I am proud to have partnered with him to secure grants 
to further the reach and impact of UC Riverside. We have collaborated 
to bring grant money from the National Science Foundation, funds from 
the Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act back to UC 
Riverside. While we will miss his unwavering commitment to academic 
excellence and thoughtful stewardship, perhaps what many of us will 
miss most is the sound of his truly infectious laugh echoing throughout 
the room. It always had a way of brightening even the toughest days.
  Happy retirement to Chancellor Wilcox and go Highlanders.

                          ____________________

             HONORING THE LIFE OF JEROME PRESTON OWENS, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BRIAN BABIN

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 6, 2025

  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Jerome 
Preston Owens, Jr., who passed away on Monday, April 21, 2025, at the 
age of 85.
  Jerome was born on June 28, 1939, in Jasper, Texas to Reverand Jerome 
Preston, Sr. and Louise Nichols Owens. He graduated as Valedictorian of 
his class in Jena, Louisiana, where his father was the pastor of the 
First Baptist Church. Upon graduating, he received a football 
scholarship to play for Louisiana College. Jerome then patriotically 
served our country in the United States Marine Corps from 1960 to 1963.
  His father served as pastor for the First Baptist Church in 
Nederland, Texas, which is where Jerome met Marilyn Fraser, the love of 
his life. In 1965, Jerome&#x27;s father officiated their marriage and they 
began their lives together. Jerome and Marilyn were married for almost 
60 years and were blessed with two daughters named Stacey and Sharla.
  He earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1969 from Baylor School of Law. 
While studying at Baylor, he was actively involved in the collegiate 
community, serving as a member of Alpha Chi and Senior Class President. 
Jerome practiced as an attorney specializing in corporate law for 
Coastal Corporation in Corpus Christi and Houston, Texas, where he 
traveled extensively. Jerome&#x27;s primary devotion throughout life was for 
his family. His young daughter&#x27;s drawing of him holding his suitcase 
inspired him to relocate to a smaller community to have more time with 
his family. He chose to move to Woodville, Texas where he established 
his own law practice and raised cattle with his father.
  Truly a man with a commitment to serve others and seeking to make a 
difference in the community, Jerome served as County Judge of Tyler 
County for 17 years. He then served as a Texas State District Judge and 
a Texas Senior Judge. Jerome continued to faithfully serve his 
community by being a deacon and trustee of the First Baptist Church of 
Woodville. After moving to Houston, he became a deacon at Second 
Baptist Church in Kingwood, Texas.
  He received many awards recognizing his dedication to public service. 
Jerome was named the ``Ralph W. Steen Memorial East Texan of the 
Year,&#x27;&#x27; and ``Tyler County Citizen of the Year.&#x27;&#x27; For his leadership 
and skills, he received the ``Award for Excellence in Community 
Service,&#x27;&#x27; and the ``American Hometown Leadership Award.&#x27;&#x27; Jerome was 
appointed by Governor Rick Perry to chair the Texas State Community 
Development Review Committee. Additionally, he served on the board of 
trustees for East Texas Baptist University, board of directors for the 
Tyler County Hospital, served as president for Deep East Texas Council 
of Governments, president for Deep East Texas County Commissioners and 
Judges Association, the Tyler County Bar Association, and fellow at the 
Texas Bar Association. He was also a member of the American Legion.
  Jerome is remembered as ``one who loved his family and friends, for 
his deep commitment to God, his unwavering integrity, his eloquent 
speeches, deep wisdom, quick wit, humor and bellowing infectious 
laugh.&#x27;&#x27; Jerome was highly esteemed and adored by his family and 
community. His family has said, ``He was an all-around kind of man, one 
that loved sports, southern food, current events and a good joke. He 
was well versed in politics and had an answer for any question asked of 
him.&#x27;&#x27; He served diligently, was a loving husband, father, and 
grandfather. Jerome was a lifetime friend and inspiration.
  Jerome was preceded in death by his parents, Reverend Jerome Preston, 
Sr., and Louise Owens, and sister, Jane Owens Griffin. He is survived 
by his wife Marilyn Fraser Owens; daughter Stacy Owens Ekstein, son-in-
law Chris Ekstein, daughter Dr. Sharla Owens Sundberg, son-in-law Dr. 
Eric Sundberg; grandchildren, Bella Frances Ekstein, Sophia Marilyn 
Ekstein, Savea Kenny Sundberg, Soren Jon Jerome Sundberg and Anders 
Owens Sundberg, sister, Diann Owens Dotson, brother-in-law Ray Dotson; 
brothers-in-law, Tom Fraser, III, and Ed Fraser, sister-in-law Jean 
Fraser; and many nephews and nieces.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor my dear friend, Jerome Owens, for 
his many years of faithful service to his community. My most sincere 
prayers remain with his family and friends during this difficult time.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 6, 2025

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;m honored to recognize Mr. Brian Wisler on 
his well-earned retirement after 35 years.
  Mr. Wisler was hired by the Central York School District in 1990 as 
an elementary physical education teacher--where he shortly after, in 
May of 1991 was the creator of the Central York School District 
Elementary Track meet--which was later renamed in honor of long-time 
principal Jefferey Fox (who supported the initiative), to the Jefferey 
Fox Track Meet. Starting with just five events the track meet has grown 
to now include myriad events including dozens of runs, javelin throws, 
high jump, long jump, tug of war, softball and foxtail throws and 
others--that sometimes feature entire classrooms on the field.
  The incredible day of sportsmanship directed by Mr. Wisler has 
positively impacted thousands of students over the years--proving his 
dedication to the students of North Hills and Sinking Springs 
elementary schools. After 35 years of teaching and engaging students, 
and 33 track meets, Mr. Wisler&#x27;s service sets the standard by which we 
should all be judged.
  Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;m privileged and honored to recognize Mr. Brian Wisler 
on his retirement. I wish him and all his students Godspeed on their 
future adventures.

   RECOGNIZING COAST GUARD AUXILIARY CLEARWATER FLOTILLA 11-1&#x27;S 75TH 
                              ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 6, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coast Guard 
Auxiliary Clearwater Flotilla 11-1&#x27;s 75th Anniversary. The U.S. Coast 
Guard Auxiliary was established by Congress to support the Coast Guard 
with its boat safety mission. Clearwater Flotilla 11-1&#x27;s service to the 
Clearwater area predates the Coast Guard&#x27;s presence in the city. Today, 
though, the Auxiliary provides direct and continuing support to Coast 
Guard Air Station Clearwater and to Coast Guard Station Sand Key. This 
June, the Clearwater Flotilla 11-1, celebrates its 75th anniversary of 
service to the boating public throughout the Tampa Bay area. The Coast 
Guard Auxiliary and Flotilla 11-1 provide invaluable support to the 
active-duty Coast Guard through a variety of non-law enforcement 
programs. These include search and rescue missions, marine 
environmental patrols, youth programs, public education and safety 
patrols. Additionally, their missions include search and rescue ``call 
outs&#x27;&#x27;, back up marine radio coverage and near short patrols as part of 
the America&#x27;s Waterway Watch Program. As the Coast Guard&#x27;s homeland and 
national security responsibilities continue to expand, the men and 
women of the Auxiliary have stepped up to increase their port security 
patrols to provide for the defense of our Nation&#x27;s and in our case 
Florida&#x27;s coastline and waterways.
  Last year, the Flotilla 11-1 members volunteered more than 9,100 
hours in support of the Coast Guard. The group conducted ten boating 
safety education classes with more than 200 graduates, including over 
100 children ranging from kindergarten to fifth grade. The group also 
performed almost 150 Vessel Safety Checks to ensure recreational 
boaters have all the safety gear they need to be legal and safe and 
conducted more than 175 Recreational Boating Safety Program Visits to 
boat equipment stores, marinas, and harborages to improve public 
safety. Flotilla 11-1 Clearwater operates under the leadership of Karen 
Miller, Commander, and Betsy Scott, Vice-Commander. The Flotilla 11-1&#x27;s 
officers include: Jeff Otto--Communication Services, Debbie Mallory--
Finance, Steve Bushnell-Fowler--Human Resources, Karen Miller--
Information Services, Public Affairs, and Public Education, Joe 
Garisto--Materials, Mavrick Putnam--Marine Safety and Environmental 
Protection, Lisa Repetto--Publications and Recreational Boating Safety 
Program Visitations, Gerard Gaudry--Navigation Systems,

[[Page E394]]

Tim Dolan--Operations and Rescue and Survival Systems, Mark Kolupa--
Secretary/Records, and Andre Skoinezny--Vessel Examinations. It is my 
hope that my colleagues will join me in thanking the men and women of 
Clearwater Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 11-1 for their 75 years of 
service to our community and for a job well done.

                          Tuesday, May 6, 2025

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Walter Eugene 
Hunter of Celina, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot 
Award. Walter has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community 
and country.
  As a young man, Walter was a decorated Boy Scout and Cub Scout leader 
and worked as a messenger boy for Western Union. During the Second 
World War, he heeded the call to defend our nation after witnessing the 
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and he proudly enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps. Walter served in combat as a Field Communications 
Specialist during the grueling battles of Guadalcanal, Bougainville, 
and Green Island, in which he was awarded a Unit Citation for his 
meritorious actions. He later worked in aviation electronics in North 
Carolina before being honorably discharged in 1945. During the conflict 
in Korea, Walter was also briefly called back to duty from the 
Reserves.
  After his service, Walter has continued to be an upstanding American 
citizen, patriot, and family man. He met his late wife Irene, a US Army 
cadet nurse, and they were happily married for a remarkable 77 years. 
Together, they had three daughters and many more grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren. Walter earned his doctorate degree from the 
University of Colorado and guided the doctoral research of 65 graduate 
students at the University of Missouri. For his excellent teaching 
abilities and his students&#x27; achievements, Walter received cash awards 
from the American Chemical Society, which he used to purchase science 
books for the school library. He also raised thousands of dollars to 
install an FM radio station for students interested in learning radio 
communications. At the young age of 103, Walter frequently travels 
across the country to spend time with his family and remains passionate 
about learning. In his free time, Walter studies science and Chaos 
theory. I am grateful for Walter&#x27;s extensive contributions to our 
community and country, and I wish him good health for many years to 
come.
  It is an honor to bestow Walter with the Patriot Award for his 
exceptional service to the people of North Texas.

   RECOGNIZING SUE ABDERHOLDEN FOR HER WORK ON BEHALF OF THOSE WITH 
                   DISABILITIES AND MENTAL ILLNESSES

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. KELLY MORRISON

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                          Tuesday, May 6, 2025

  Ms. MORRISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Sue 
Abderholden for her decades of tireless service and steadfast 
commitment to Minnesotans living with disabilities and mental 
illnesses.
  For the past 24 years, Ms. Abderholden has served as Executive 
Director of the Minnesota chapter of the National Alliance on Mental 
Illness.
  Under her leadership, our state has become more compassionate, more 
informed, and more responsive to the needs of those facing mental 
health challenges.
  She played a central role in passing over two dozen laws that 
expanded access to care and improved how we support people with mental 
illnesses.
  Ms. Abderholden&#x27;s advocacy brought mental health training into our 
schools, ensured screenings for individuals entering the justice 
system, and reformed civil commitment laws to emphasize voluntary 
treatment.
  She expanded crisis and early intervention services, championed a 
more diverse mental health workforce, and worked to strengthen housing 
and community-based support services.
  Her compassion extended to her home where Ms. Abderholden and her 
family fostered children with disabilities and youth aging out of 
foster care, offering stability and care when it was most needed.
  On behalf of myself and countless Minnesotans, I offer my gratitude 
to Ms. Abderholden for her decades of hard work and service.

                         TRUMP&#x27;S FIRST 100 DAYS

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 5, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the 
challenges and burdens placed on Black Americans during the first 100 
days of the Trump Administration. Donald Trump is undoing the progress 
African Americans have fought for, threatening justice, equality, and 
our democracy. His administration has cut jobs, programs, and services 
that help Black professionals, students, and business owners thrive. 
Mississippi&#x27;s public universities invested over $23 million in DEI 
programs that supported Black students, and now those programs are at 
risk. Donald Trump has also removed protections for minority-owned 
businesses, weakened civil rights enforcement, and cut funding for 
public health research, all while costs rise. More than 664,000 
Mississippians are at risk of losing Medicaid. Black families, already 
facing chronic illness and poor healthcare access, will bear the full 
burden. Head Start, which serves nearly 20,000 children in Mississippi, 
is also in danger. Black children, who already face significant 
barriers to education, will be hit the hardest. These cuts cause actual 
harm and send the message that Black lives and futures don&#x27;t matter. We 
deserve leadership that sees, hears, and fights for us. And we won&#x27;t 
stop demanding it.
