                           HON. ERIC SWALWELL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues, Representative 
Lee and Representative Khanna to recognize the Community Child Care 
Council of Alameda County, which will celebrate 50 years of serving 
children and families in Alameda County on Thursday, October 5, 2023.
  The Community Childcare Coordinating Council of Alameda County, which 
later became the ``4Cs&#x27;&#x27; of Alameda County, was founded in December of 
1972 to offer essential resources to assist families with a network of 
community services.
  4Cs provides access to affordable childcare and family-focused 
services including childcare referrals, payment assistance, playgroups, 
free tax preparation assistance, car seat installation checks, and 
family workshops. 4Cs also supports local childcare providers by 
offering health and safety trainings, best practices seminars, and 
ongoing consultation support.
  Operating with locations in Hayward, Oakland, and Fremont, 4Cs is 
governed by a 14-member Board of Directors which employs 75 team 
members providing services in 18 languages, including English, Spanish, 
Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi.
  As a leading family resource agency, 4Cs has provided over 3,500 
personalized referrals, 91 trainings, and over $28 million in payments 
to cover childcare costs for 1,961 families in Alameda County in 2022.
  For 50 years, the 4Cs of Alameda County played a pivotal role in 
ensuring families can secure culturally competent, high-quality 
childcare in Alameda County. They have truly embodied their values of 
diversity, accountability, professionalism, teamwork, growth, 
innovation, and friendship for all children and families. We join the 
Community Child Care Council of Alameda County in celebrating its 
legacy and wish it many more productive years to come.

             CELEBRATING THE HOUSE CAREER OF MR. ANDY FLICK

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DAVID J. TRONE

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career of Mr. 
Andy Flick, my former Chief of Staff, as he departs the People&#x27;s House 
after 14 years to serve Vice President Harris as her new Director of 
Legislative Affairs.
  When I was elected to Congress in 2018, I had achieved success in 
business, but I was a novice at operating in the halls of Congress. I 
had big ideas about what our country needed, and I knew I needed the 
right team in place to execute and help me be as effective a legislator 
as I possibly could. It was recommended I speak with Andy, who had 
significant experience in the House, an impressive professional 
network, and was brimming with ideas on how to run a Congressional 
office.
  I hired Andy and we were off and running. Andy knew how to both move 
legislation and manage a team to bring out their potential. Our best 
conversations revolved around my experience running a business and 
applying it to management on Capitol Hill. From Andy, I learned from 
his insights into politics and procedure. As a manager, Andy ran our 
team with professionalism and empathy, and consistently pushed the team 
to achieve our shared goals. Andy helped me realize one of my top 
priorities in Congress when we founded the Freshman Working Group on 
Addiction--which has since grown into the Bipartisan Mental Health &amp; 
Substance Use Disorder Task Force, a 140-member group dedicated to 
overcoming the opioid epidemic. We signed four bills into law my 
freshman term and chalked up more wins in the 117th Congress.
  As a true talent, Andy was eventually offered a position he couldn&#x27;t 
refuse--to become Executive Director of the New Democrat Coalition. 
Over the three years he served in my office, Andy proved himself a 
consummate leader by hiring and training a team that operated with his 
same dedication to public service--and so was able to take the new 
opportunity, knowing he left the office in good hands. Similarly, he 
leaves the New Democrat Coalition for another opportunity, leaving 
behind a Coalition that is stronger and more impactful for his 
leadership.
  I will continue to support Andy to achieve all his professional and 
personal goals. His hard work and innovative thinking have earned my 
respect, and his commitment to public service has earned my admiration. 
He will always be my first great advisor in public office, and a true 
friend.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the staff of my office past and present, I 
celebrate Andy&#x27;s 14-year career in the U.S. House of Representatives 
and wish him nothing but success in his next chapter.

                          ____________________

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Shell for his 
service to Alabama&#x27;s First Congressional District. John Shell initiated 
the Eagle Reef Project, which involves deploying reef structures to 
foster marine life. These reefs are installed under docks or wharfs to 
filter and clean up to 10,000,000 gallons of water annually. They 
provide homes for many species of fish and crabs. John raised $52,000 
for 175 reefs in aims to expand the project to reach 1,000 reefs along 
the coast of Alabama, and eventually to Mississippi and Florida. He 
hopes to do a similar project in coastal areas along the Gulf and the 
Atlantic.
  His environmental impact on our waters is remarkable. We wish him all 
the best in his future endeavors.

               FILIPINO AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH RESOLUTION

                                 ______
                                 

                              HON. ED CASE

                               of hawaii

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, each year our country recognizes October as 
Filipino American History Month, a time for all Americans to celebrate 
the incredible past, present and future of our fellow citizens whose 
heritage lies in the great country of the Philippines.
  I am especially humbled to do so as the Representative of Hawaii&#x27;s 
First Congressional District, where some 190,000 Filipino Americans 
live, more than any other of our 435 districts throughout the country. 
With Hawaii&#x27;s Second Congressional District that has the second largest 
Filipino Americans population at about 180,000, our Fil-Am community in

[[Page E919]]

Hawaii stands at 370,000. In total, fully a quarter of all Hawaii 
residents are Filipino Americans, by far the largest percentage of any 
state or territory.
  We observe Filipino American History Month in October because the 
first recorded arrival of Filipinos in the continental United States 
took place on October 18, 1587, when the ``Luzones Indios&#x27;&#x27; came ashore 
from the Manila-built galleon Nuestra Senora de Esperanza in Morro Bay, 
California. Today, across the country Filipino Americans have a 
population of approximately 4,400,000 and are the third largest Asian 
American and Pacific Islander group in the United States.
  Many of the early Filipino immigrants were young men who came to the 
United States seeking a better life. Most found work in Hawaii, 
California, Washington and Alaska. This first generation of Filipino 
immigrants are commonly referred to as the Manong generation (Ilocano 
for first-born male). They worked mostly physically demanding jobs in 
tough conditions for very little pay. Over the years, they fought 
against discrimination, found a way forward and made a better future 
for themselves and their future generations. They became respected 
members of communities throughout our nation.
  The history of the Fil-Am community in Hawaii is particularly rich 
and echoes the national story. In 1906, the first 15 sakada contract 
laborers arrived in Honolulu from the Philippines aboard the SS Doric, 
marking the first sustained immigration into our country and the humble 
beginnings of Fil-Ams in Hawaii. These first immigrants, those that 
followed and the subsequent generations eventually became trailblazers 
in politics and government, the military, business and 
entrepreneurship, journalism, popular culture, music and the arts and 
more.
  Domingo Los Banos was Hawaii&#x27;s first Filipino American school 
principal and a loyal veteran of the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment 
that fought in the Philippines during World War II.
  Carolina Dizon Wong broke a glass ceiling when she obtained an M.D. 
degree and became the first Filipino American to start a medical 
practice in Hawaii in 1952.
  Peter Aduja became the first Fil-Am elected to public office in the 
United States when he was elected to the Hawaii Territorial House of 
Representatives in 1954.
  Ines Cayaban was the first Filipino American graduate of the School 
of Public Health, Nursing and Social Work at the University of Hawaii. 
She received the prestigious Jefferson Award in 1986 for her service.
  In 1994, Ben Cayetano was elected the Governor of Hawaii, becoming 
the first Filipino American governor of a state in our union.
  In 2019, Roy Macaraeg became the first Fil-Am to become a general 
officer in the history of Hawaii&#x27;s citizen soldier ranks.
  In Hawaii, we also regularly honor the over 250,000 Filipinos who 
answered the call to protect and defend America and the Philippines in 
the Pacific theater. In 2016, President Obama signed into law the 
Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act to 
bestow Congress&#x27;s highest honor upon those veterans. With my colleagues 
in the House, I have introduced our Filipino Veterans Family 
Reunification Act, which seeks to reunite World War II Filipino 
soldiers with their children, so that we can honor those living in our 
community who fought to protect the free and open Indo-Pacific that we 
have today.
  Each and all of these lives of achievement are but a small sampling 
of a broader community that has achieved so much and contributed so 
much to the rich fabric of our country. And the story of Filipino 
Americans is still in its early chapters.
  This is why it is important that we take the time to recognize groups 
like Filipino Americans. The story of Filipino Americans, and to an 
extent, the stories of all of our various ethnic groups, is the story 
of America. From very humble beginnings, they have risen through hard 
work, sacrifice, commitment to advancing the next generations and 
mutual support to achieve so much already. That well describes Filipino 
Americans overall--embracing the responsibilities and opportunities of 
America while honoring and treasuring the rich heritage of their 
ancestral homeland.
  All of this is why I joined my friends and colleagues Congresswoman 
Michelle Steel, Congressman Bobby Scott, Congressman James Moylan and 
others in introducing this bipartisan resolution to express support for 
the designation of October as Filipino American History Month. We urge 
our colleagues&#x27; support to promote an ongoing appreciation of the 
contributions of Filipino Americans to our country and the rich 
diversity of our nation.
  To Fil-Ams everywhere, ``Maraming Salamat Po&#x27;&#x27; and ``Dios ti 
Agngina&#x27;&#x27;--congratulations. I truly look forward to partnering with 
them on their next proud chapters.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Dave Cort&#x27;s 
32 years of service as the San Geronimo Valley Community Center&#x27;s 
Executive Director.
  Dave became the Community Center&#x27;s first executive director in June 
of 1991. This part-time job was the first paid position for the 
organization and came with only three required qualifications: owning a 
truck, being able to lift 100 pounds, and possessing people skills. His 
role and the services provided by the Community Center expanded 
exponentially over the next 3 decades.
  Dave ensured the Community Center was a successful resource for the 
San Geronimo Valley residents. He reformed the local delivery service, 
partnered with Lagunitas School District to facilitate after-school and 
daycare programs, and managed the expansion of senior services to 
include a new Senior Lunch program in the early 2000s. Understanding 
the need for recreation opportunities to promote community wellness, 
Dave also worked to build the Community Gym in 2010.
  In 2019, Dave rallied community donors to seed the Deepening Roots 
Endowment with $2 million. A year later, the COVID-19 pandemic 
underscored the need for financial security for the Center in order to 
provide critical services to the San Geronimo Valley community 
emergencies. During the pandemic, Dave assembled the Community Center&#x27;s 
resources to bring vaccines, tests, food, emergency funds, accurate 
information, and a sense of community to the residents of West Marin.
  Today, the San Geronimo Valley Community Center has a staff of 22 
people and a comprehensive mission to foster healthy communities within 
the San Geronimo Valley and Nicasio. Thanks to Dave Cort&#x27;s dedication 
and leadership, the organization has become integral to the quality of 
life for the community, ensuring local residents have access to quality 
programs in the arts, youth services, senior services, community 
events, and more.
  Mr. Speaker, Dave Cort exemplifies what it means to be a community-
minded public servant. His contributions to the San Geronimo Valley 
Community Center and the people of West Marin are extraordinary and 
appreciated. Therefore, please join us in congratulating him for 
decades of inspiring work.

 HONORING REUNION OF U.S. ARMY NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER CANDIDATE COURSE

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute 
to hundreds of United States Army veterans who are gathering in and 
around our nation&#x27;s capital the week of September 25, 2023, to join in 
reunion of their graduation from the Noncommissioned Officers Candidate 
Course (NCOCC).
  The program was established for the training of noncommissioned 
officers in the U.S. Army. The program operated at Fort Benning, GA, 
Fort Bliss, TX, Fort Knox, KY, Fort Sill, OK, and Fort Leonard Wood, 
MO, from 1967 to 1972, during the height of the Vietnam War. As a proud 
graduate of the program and fellow Vietnam War veteran, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring and saluting these leaders, combat 
veterans--many of them wounded--and unsung heroes.
  As the Vietnam War progressed in the 1960s, the Army was running out 
of noncommissioned officers in several combat specialties. In order to 
meet these unprecedented requirements for Noncommissioned Officer

[[Page E920]]

(NCO) leaders, the Army developed a solution based on the proven 
Officer Candidate Course. If a carefully selected soldier can be given 
23 weeks of intensive training that would qualify him to lead a 
platoon, then others can be trained to lead squads and fire teams in 
the same amount of time. From this seed, the NCOCC was born.
  Army Chief of Staff Gen. Harold K. Johnson approved the concept on 
June 22, 1967, and on September 5, the first course at Fort Benning 
(now Fort Moore), Georgia, began with Sgt. Maj. Don Wright serving as 
the first NCOCC Commandant.
  Potential candidates for the course were selected from groups of 
initial entry soldiers who had a security clearance of confidential, an 
infantry score of 100 or over, and demonstrated leadership potential. 
Based on recommendations, the unit commander would select potential 
NCOs, but all were not volunteers. Those selected to attend NCOCC were 
immediately made corporals and later promoted to sergeant upon 
graduation from phase one. The select few who graduated with honors 
would be promoted to staff sergeant. The outstanding graduate of the 
first class, Staff Sgt. Melvin C. Leverick, recalled ``I think that 
those who graduated [from the NCOCC] were much better prepared for some 
of the problems that would arise in Vietnam.&#x27;&#x27; The NCO candidate course 
was designed to maximize the two-year tour of the enlisted draftee.
  Though over 300 hours of instruction was given, eighty percent was 
conducted in the field. The final basic phase was a ``dress rehearsal 
for Vietnam,&#x27;&#x27; a full week of patrols, ambush, defensive perimeters, 
and navigation. Twice daily, the Vietnam-schooled rangers critiqued the 
candidates, and all training was conducted tactically.
  These men, many now of advanced age, served our country with great 
honor under challenging circumstances. Four were awarded the Medal of 
Honor. Six are still missing. Many--1,118 in all--never made it home.
  Mr. Speaker, it is evident that these outstanding noncommissioned 
officers and combat veterans were an indispensable part of our armed 
forces and served our country with bravery, dedication, and honor.

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Bertha Ramsey, a 
long-time resident of the City of Detroit, as she celebrates 100 years 
of life.
  Born October 2, 1923, Mother Ramsey&#x27;s loving parents instilled in her 
the values of patience and hard work, as they raised her and her 12 
siblings in rural Laurel, Mississippi. Her compassionate nature shined 
through in everything she did, and she always held onto faith, 
especially in trying times.
  A move to Detroit in 1942 was pivotal for Mother Ramsey. It wasn&#x27;t 
merely a change of address. In Detroit, she witnessed the World War II 
era, the Detroit race protests of 1943, the milestones of the Civil 
Rights Movement, the profound impact of the 1967 Detroit Rebellion, 
Detroit&#x27;s first Black mayor, and the groundbreaking election of Barack 
Obama. Detroit was also where Bertha&#x27;s path crossed with Burnett 
Ramsey. Together, they raised 4 children in a home full of love. As the 
family tree expanded to 8 grandchildren, 20 great-grandchildren, and 6 
great-great-grandchildren, Bertha emerged as the spiritual compass, 
always emphasizing the importance of faith and kinship.

                       RECOGNIZING DIXIE FERGUSON

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
dear friend, Dixie Ferguson, for her outstanding work and life-long 
dedication to serving our men and women in uniform and the veterans of 
our Eastern Washington community.
  Dixie began her service journey in 1966 when she joined the American 
Red Cross after graduating from the University of California, Davis. 
She joined the Clubmobile Service and provided support to our combat 
troops in Vietnam as a ``Donut Dolly.&#x27;&#x27; Dixie became well-known for her 
work at USO shows--singing, dancing, and serving food--to the young men 
fighting for our freedom who were missing home. After returning home in 
1968, Dixie served as a social worker at Long Beach Naval Hospital in 
California, Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Colorado, and the Naval 
Hospital at Camp Pendleton where she supported those wounded in combat.
  Fast forward more than 50 years later, and Dixie is still serving our 
active duty and retired service members through the American Red Cross 
Chapter in Walla Walla. In 2016, she earned the Red Cross Volunteer of 
the Year Award for her work as an outreach and emergency communications 
caseworker.
  Dixie has gone above and beyond volunteering her time through the 
years. Most recently, she has played an instrumental role in 
documenting the stories of those who served in World War II and Vietnam 
through the Library of Congress&#x27; Veterans History Project. To date, she 
has helped record nearly 200 veterans&#x27; stories. Additionally, Dixie has 
helped coordinate flights in the skies of Walla Walla for nearly 700 
veterans as part of The Honour Project, while also proudly helping 
members of the Greatest Generation make their journey to visit the war 
memorials in Washington, D.C. as a part of the Inland Northwest Honor 
Flight.
  There is truly no task too big or too small for Dixie. Throughout the 
years, she served on a local committee responsible for bringing the 
second Gold Star Families Monument to Washington state. In 2021, she 
established Volunteers Love Serving Veterans, a local non-profit 
committed to service. Most recently, she organized and planned an 
annual POW/MIA ceremony event, where she welcomed a Congressional Medal 
of Honor recipient to be the guest speaker.
  One thing is certain: There are very few in our country who have 
rolled out the red carpet for our veterans like Dixie Ferguson has. Her 
love of service and dedication to our veterans has brought endless joy 
to the Walla Walla military and veteran community that continues to 
grow each year.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the 
outstanding service of Dixie Ferguson to our men and women in uniform. 
Her work on their behalf is awe inspiring, and the profound impact she 
has had on our Nation&#x27;s heroes will leave a legacy not soon to be 
forgotten.

      RECOGNIZING JAMES MANUEL VILLA WITH A CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN 
                              COMMENDATION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PETE SESSIONS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to present James Manuel 
Villa of Waco, Texas with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  James Villa&#x27;s dedication is evident from his three combat deployments 
in Iraq with the Marines First Division, Second Battalion, 5th 
Regiment. Joining the Marines in 2002, his initial engagement in 2003 
saw participation in the Battle of Al Faw, capturing pivotal regions 
around the Rumaila Oil Field, and ensuring security and stability in 
Samawah, Iraq. His subsequent deployment in 2004 to Ramadi earned him 
the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with combat distinguished 
service, a testament to his leadership as a fire team leader.
  Even after fulfilling his enlistment and intending to pursue 
education at Baylor University, duty called him back. His third 
deployment brought more accolades for distinguished service in 
Fallujah, coupled with the significant responsibility of training 70 
Iraqi police recruits. He attained the rank of Sergeant, receiving his 
honorable discharge in 2009.
  Following his service with the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton in 
2009, James transitioned to education. He achieved his Bachelor of Arts 
from Rockhurst University in 2011 and later a Master of Education from 
Tarleton State University. Besides his academic achievements, James&#x27;s 
impact in the community of Waco is profound. As an eighth-grade science 
teacher, he was celebrated as the 2017 Waco ISD Secondary Teacher of 
the Year. Today, he stands as a beacon of leadership and hope as the 
principal of La Vega High School, holding a deep-seated belief in the 
potential of every student and their ability to effect change in their 
community.
  James, alongside his wife Ivy, are the proud parents of five 
daughters and three sons, reflecting his commitment both to family and 
nation.
  For his relentless dedication to his country, and now his community, 
it is with deep respect that I present the Congressional Veteran 
Commendation to James M. Villa.

                    RECOGNIZING OUR LADY OF VICTORY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RASHIDA TLAIB

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 29, 2023

  Mr. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize the parish of Our 
Lady of Victory and its founding mother, Anna Bates, as they celebrate 
eighty years of service in faith to the people of Detroit in Michigan&#x27;s 
12th Congressional District.
  Our Lady of Victory&#x27;s story begins in a store front on Eight Mile 
Road in 1943. Mother Bates was instrumental in ensuring that the parish 
had a home in Detroit in spite of segregation and other challenges to a 
predominately Black place of worship. In 1941, the city built an eight-
foot segregation wall that extended a half-mile long just blocks from 
the new Our Lady of Victory mission site. As tensions over disparity 
and racial injustice came to a head, resulting in the 1943 protests, 
the wall became a symbol for the increasingly unjust living conditions 
for Black residents.
  Spurred by the protest and increasing tension, Mother Bates spent ten 
years petitioning the archdiocese to create a house of worship for 
Black residents who were not permitted to enter any of the neighboring 
white Catholic Churches. Nearby Catholic parishes were adamantly 
opposed to welcoming Black Catholics. But Mother Bates persevered. Our 
Lady of Victory was finally recognized as a parish. Though the parish 
has relocated over the years, we are glad they are now housed in the 
St. Scholastica campus in Michigan&#x27;s 12th District.
  Please join me in recognizing of Our Lady of Victory&#x27;s legacy in the 
fight against racial injustice, as they celebrate eighty years of 
service and fellowship in faith.
