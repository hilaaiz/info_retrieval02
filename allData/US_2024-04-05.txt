I rise today to commend the remarkable 
leadership and service of Van Mobley, President of the Village of 
Thiensville, whose unwavering dedication has significantly enriched the 
lives of his constituents and propelled the progress of his community 
over the last twelve years..
  Throughout his dedicated career, Van Mobley has demonstrated an 
extraordinary commitment to public service and community development. 
His journey began in 2006 when he was appointed to the Village Board as 
a Trustee, filling a vacant seat, and subsequently earning the trust of 
his constituents through two additional three-year terms. In 2012, he 
was elected Village President, a position he has since held for four 
consecutive three-year terms.
  Under President Mobleys stewardship, Thiensville has experienced 
remarkable growth and advancement. His visionary leadership has spurred 
significant infrastructure improvements and development projects 
throughout the village. Notably, he spearheaded the development on 
South Main Street, overseeing crucial water infrastructure 
installations and the establishment of key properties, including the 
Thiensville Health Alliance, Reuter Insurance, and a new Village 
parking lot. His pivotal role in the Pigeon Creek flood control project 
has been instrumental in safeguarding Main Street from flooding during 
major rain events.
  President Mobleys commitment to collaboration and intergovernmental 
cooperation has been exemplified by his efforts to merge fire and EMS 
services with the City of Mequon, resulting in the formation of the 
Southern Ozaukee Fire and EMS Department. This innovative partnership 
has garnered recognition from the Wisconsin Policy Forum for its 
effectiveness and efficiency.
  Beyond infrastructure, President Mobley has overseen numerous 
enhancements in Village Park, including the construction of the Port 
Washington State Bank River Stage, new Comfort Station, playground 
upgrades, and boat launch improvements. Van Mobleys dedication to 
preserving Thiensvilles rich history and heritage is evident in his 
personal investment in the historic Thiensville State Bank building on 
Green Bay Road, which he purchased and meticulously renovated.
  In recognition of his exceptional service and tireless efforts on 
behalf of the residents of Thiensville, I extend my heartfelt gratitude 
and congratulations to Van Mobley. His accomplishments have had a 
profound and lasting impact on the community, and I wish him continued 
success in all his future endeavors.
CELEBRATING UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND PROFESSOR EMERITA DR. ANN WYLIES 
                              of maryland
over the weekend, a great Marylander and 
important member of our University of Maryland community celebrated her 
eightieth birthday: Dr. Ann Wylie. She has educated countless students 
from across Maryland and America ever since she first became an 
Assistant Professor for the University of Marylands Department of 
Agronomy in 1972. The following year, she became a founding faculty 
member of the University of Marylands renowned Department of Geology.
  From the Presidents Medal and the Scholar-Teacher Award at the 
University of Maryland, College Park, to the Butler Prize awarded by 
the Geological Society of Washington, Dr. Wylie has received widespread 
acclaim for her research and leadership in academia. Crucially, Dr. 
Wylie has displayed a commitment to service that deserves the 
admiration of every Member of this Congress. Her work on how exposure 
to minerals--including many mined in Maryland--affect human health has 
helped us better safeguard the well-being of the American people. 
Whether for the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. geological 
survey, the U.S. Bureau of Mines, or the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health, she has made important contributions to 
our governments understanding of these issues.
  As a Terp, Im also grateful for her leadership in the University of 
Maryland, College Parks administration. Throughout her distinguished 
career, she has served as Interim Vice President and Chief Financial 
Officer, Senior Vice President and Provost, Vice President for 
Administrative Affairs, Interim Dean of the Graduate School, and many 
other vital positions. My staff and I have had the pleasure of working 
closely with Dr. Wylie on many occasions over the years--especially 
when she served as Chief of Staff to my friend Dan Mote during his 
tenure as the universitys president.
, we at the University of Maryland, College Park, could 
never have known just how lucky we were to have Dr. Wylie join our 
community more than a half century ago. She has propelled the 
university and its students to greater heights and leave an indelible 
mark on campus. I ask that all my colleagues join me in wishing my 
fellow Terp well as she marks this terrific milestone. May they also 
join me in thanking her for her many years of service and leadership.
I rise today to commemorate the 
remarkable journey of B&amp;B Theatres as they mark their centennial 
milestone. As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of B&amp;B Theatres, we 
reflect upon a century of enriching experiences, cherished memories, 
and cultural contributions in my home state of Missouri, as well as 
communities across the U.S.
  Beyond its cinematic offerings, B&amp;B Theatres has been a beacon of 
community engagement, fostering connections and bringing people 
together. Through partnerships with local organizations, schools, and 
charities, B&amp;B Theatres has demonstrated a profound dedication to 
giving back to the communities it serves.
  Moreover, B&amp;B Theatres has continuously embraced innovation, adapting 
to the evolving landscape of the entertainment industry while staying 
true to its core values. From the introduction of state-of-the-art 
technology to the enhancement of amenities and services, B&amp;B Theatres 
has consistently elevated the moviegoing experience, ensuring that 
patrons receive nothing short of excellence.
  As we honor the legacy of B&amp;B Theatres on this momentous occasion, 
let us extend our heartfelt congratulations to the founders, employees, 
and patrons who have contributed to its enduring success. May the next 
century be filled with continued prosperity, innovation, and memorable 
experiences for all who walk through the doors of B&amp;B Theatres.

  In recognition of its 100 years of unparalleled entertainment and 
community service, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 
remarkable legacy of B&amp;B Theatres and the profound impact it has had on 
our Nations cultural landscape.
I rise to honor Mr. Alvin 
Joseph Picard, a son of South Louisiana who by nature of his service in 
World War II has been recognized with the Congressional Gold Medal--the 
highest expression of national appreciation through Congress.
a native of Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, born on 
December 9, 1919. He grew up amid the Depression and reached adulthood 
at a time of national crisis. When America entered the Second World 
War, Mr. Picard enlisted in the United States Army. He held the rank of 
Technician Fifth Grade with Signal Company of the 23rd Headquarters 
Special Troops. This top-secret unit is now known fondly as the ``Ghost 
Army. The 1,100-man unit was assigned a critical task: to mask and 
misrepresent the whereabouts, trajectory, and strength of Allied forces 
in Nazi-occupied France.
  Operating in the European theater, the Ghost Army was engaged in 
battlefield operations beginning in June of 1944. The units deception 
strategies were critical to many Allied victories across Europe, 
including the D-Day landings. As a Cryptographic Technician in Signal 
Company, Mr. Picard employed ``spoof radio to confuse Axis forces and 
conceal the movements of other Allied troops. His efforts and those of 
others in the Ghost Army saved countless American lives.
  Thirty years after the war, a U.S. Army report noted: ``rarely, if 
ever, has there existed a group of such few men, which had so great an 
influence on the outcome of a major military campaign. While aiding 
the victory in Europe, the Ghost Army also laid the foundation for 
modern defense strategies, on which our national security depends. As 
we confront present threats in psychological, cyber, and information 
warfare, the legacy of the Ghost Army and soldiers like Mr. Picard 
endures.
  Although the Congressional Gold Medal reaches Mr. Picard 
posthumously, he is survived by a grateful family, community, and 
country. On behalf of Louisianas 3rd District, I thank Mr. Picard for 
his service. May God bless his family and his Veteran Brothers of the 
Ghost Army.
today I rise to honor the memory of the late 
Scott Nicholas, a remarkable individual from Smithtown, New York. Scott 
Nicholas was not only a Captain in the United States Naval Reserve but 
also a dedicated professor at the United States Merchant Marine Academy 
in Kings Point, NY.
1999 to 
2010. His contributions during Operation Iraqi Freedom aboard the USNS 
Algol earned him well-deserved recognition. Furthermore, he served with 
distinction on the USNS Mendonca and Pililaau from 2006 to 2008 and as 
Captain on the USNS Brittin from 2008 to 2010.
  Beyond his service in the Naval Reserve, Mr. Nicholas continued to 
serve his country as a professor of Nautical Sciences and Simulation at 
the United States Merchant Marine Academy until his untimely passing on 
November 19, 2023. His dedication and commitment to his Nation 
exemplify true heroism.
  My heartfelt condolences and profound appreciation for his service 
extend to his beloved wife, Heather, and his entire family. May the 
United States and the State of New York forever cherish patriots like 
Scott Nicholas. May his legacy endure, and may he find eternal peace.
I rise to honor the memory of Clay Adam 
Bryant, a cherished resident of Pottsville, Arkansas, whose passing on 
March 23, 2024, leaves a profound void in the community and in 
Arkansas Fourth Congressional District.
  Born on March 21, 1977, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Adam was the beloved son 
of Clay and Dianna Bryant. Throughout his life, he exemplified 
compassion, dedication, and a steadfast commitment to service. Adams 
legacy as a devoted firefighter spanned over 24 years, during which he 
selflessly served the Chickalah and Pottsville Fire Departments. His 
bravery and resilience in the face of danger touched countless lives 
and inspired admiration among his peers.
  Beyond his role as a firefighter, Adam was known for his caring heart 
and willingness to lend a helping hand. He found joy in coaching 
softball for his children, embodying the values of teamwork and 
camaraderie. A staunch supporter of the Razorbacks, Adams passion for 
sports brought together friends and family in celebration of shared 
victories.
  In his spare time, Adam found solace in the great outdoors and 
enjoyed hunting and fishing. His presence brought warmth and laughter 
to every gathering, especially when surrounded by his family, including 
his wife, Esperanza, his children, grandchildren, brother, sister, 
nieces, nephews, and a multitude of cherished friends.
  As we reflect on Adams life, let us remember his infectious smile, 
his dedication to his community, and his profound impact on all who had 
the privilege of knowing him. May his legacy of kindness and service to 
others continue to inspire future generations.
  May we honor Adams memory by embracing the principles of compassion, 
unity, and selflessness that defined his life. Our thoughts and prayers 
are with his loved ones during this time of loss.
today I pay tribute to an incredible 
advocate--Tony Spaniola--whose unwavering commitment and tireless work 
have made an indelible mark on his community, the state of Michigan, 
and beyond.
  In 2016, Tonys world shifted when he learned that his home, and many 
others near Lake Huron in Oscoda, Michigan, had been exposed to 
contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, more commonly 
known as PFAS, a class of chemicals used by industry and, in Oscodas 
case, our military. At the time, the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in 
Oscoda had been identified as the first site contaminated with PFAS in 
Michigan, and the first U.S. military PFAS site in the country.
  This revelation ignited a fire within Tony--one fueled by a 
determination to confront the threat of these ``forever chemicals. 
Studies have shown PFAS exposure may lead to an increased risk of 
cancer, decreased fertility in women, developmental delays in children, 
and other health risks. Tony became a driving force behind efforts to 
address PFAS contamination on local, state, and federal fronts.
  His leadership was instrumental in the founding of the Need Our Water 
(NOW) community action group in Oscoda. Tonys vision also extended 
beyond Michigan, as he co-founded the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network, 
and also serves on the leadership team of the National PFAS 
Contamination Coalition. He played a pivotal role in the creation of 
the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team, where he currently serves on 
the Citizens Advisory Workgroup. Furthermore, his efforts contributed 
to the establishment of the bipartisan Congressional PFAS Task Force of 
which I am proud to be a member--a group dedicated to advancing 
legislative solutions and raising awareness about the urgent need to 
address PFAS contamination nationwide. Because of his relentless 
advocacy and uncanny ability to bring stakeholders together, Tony has 
earned the respect and the ear of senior Pentagon leadership, including 
Undersecretary of Defense Bill LaPlante, and has played a major role in 
pushing the Department of Defense to act more urgently on PFAS cleanup.
  Tony has been an advocate his entire life, which can in part be 
attributed to the influence of his father, Francis Spaniola, a retired 
Army officer who served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 
1975 to 1990, representing Corunna in Shiawassee County. During his 
fathers tenure in the state legislature, when the toxic flame 
retardant polybrominated biphenyls, more commonly known as PBB, was 
mistakenly sent to Michigan farmers as livestock feed and entered the 
food supply, Tony worked alongside his father at the forefront of 
tackling the PBB health crisis. Together, they initiated legislation 
that led to the creation of the Michigan Cancer Registry, regulated 
PBB, and compensated farmers for poisoned livestock.
  I have had the privilege of bearing witness to Tonys unwavering 
passion since I took office in 2019 and remain grateful to have been

able to work with him in our fight to clean up contaminated sites 
across Michigan and this country.
  In recognition of his extraordinary contributions to our state and 
his steadfast advocacy on behalf of impacted families and communities 
nationwide, it is my honor to recognize his service.
today I want to recognize Motaz Azaiza, a 
Palestinian journalist, for his ongoing coverage of the Palestinian 
people and his commitment to telling their stories.
Since the war began, he has bravely used his 
platform to document the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the lives of the 
innocent people who have been killed. Mr. Azaizas images on the ground 
have exposed the war crimes being committed by the Israeli government 
for the world to see. We applaud his efforts and bravery for risking 
his life to report on these atrocities.
  Please join me in recognizing the numerous contributions of Motaz 
Azaiza in the field of journalism
I rise today to recognize Rabbi Bennett 
Miller as he celebrates his 50th year in the Rabbinate. It is my honor 
to join with the members of Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple and the greater 
community in celebrating this milestone.
  Upon becoming a rabbi in 1974, Rabbi Miller served under Rabbi Harvey 
Fields at Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple. In 1977 he became Senior Rabbi 
at Anshe Emeth, where he continued to serve until his retirement in 
2018.
  Following his retirement, Rabbi Miller became Rabbi Emeritus of Anshe 
Emeth Memorial Temple; he also served for one year as the Interim 
Senior Rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in Westfield. He also served as 
National Chair of the Association of Reform Zionists of America (ARZA) 
and currently serves as Chair of the URJ/ARZA Herzl Society. As Rabbi 
Emeritus, Rabbi Miller provides pastoral guidance and leadership to the 
congregation and continues to support Anshe Emeth Memorial Temples 
mission of religious education, spiritual growth, and social action.
  Rabbi Miller attended Hebrew Union College--Jewish Institute of 
Religion in Cincinnati and earned his Doctor of Ministry degree from 
Princeton Theological Seminary. In 2024, he received the Builders of 
Zion Award and in 2023 he was the recipient of Matans Trail Blazers 
Award.
  Despite his retirement, Rabbi Bennett Miller has continued to provide 
outstanding rabbinical leadership and contributions to the community. I 
sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Rabbi 
Miller on his 50th year in the Rabbinate and thanking him for his 
ongoing service.
I rise today to congratulate the 
Alzheimers Association on their 5th Annual Gala and thank them for 
their work to increase awareness and understanding of this disease and 
other related dementias. Im grateful for how they empower North Texans 
with knowledge and strategies to cope with the complexities of 
Alzheimers disease.
  The Dallas and Northeast Texas chapter of the Alzheimers Association 
advocates for those in our community impacted by Alzheimers disease, 
while pushing forward vital research endeavors focused on treatment, 
prevention, and finding a cure. Leading the way in Alzheimers 
research, the association is a critical piece of expediting global 
advancements towards ultimately ending the heartbreaking effects of 
this disease on individuals and families. As they celebrate their 5th 
anniversary, I sincerely thank the Dallas and Northeast Chapter for 
their tireless work in our community.
I rise today to honor a loving 
wife, dedicated mother, committed community servant, and effective 
higher education administrator, Dr. Marion Ross Fedrick. President Dr. 
Fedrick will be honored for her seven years of service at Albany State 
University during the annual Blue and Gold Gala that will take place on 
Saturday, April 6, 2024. Dr. Fedrick is leaving the university to 
become the new Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff for Georgia 
State University. She will also serve as Special Advisor to Chancellor 
Sonny Perdue for his Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
Initiative.
  A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Dr. Fedrick has sought to 
better herself through education to serve others. She is a three-time 
graduate of the University of Georgia, earning a bachelors degree in 
adult education, with a concentration in organizational development, a 
masters degree in public administration, and a Ph.D. in higher 
education.
  Because of her commitment to excellence, she has excelled 
professionally. She has given her time and talents to several 
organizations to include Clark-Atlanta University, Emory University 
Hospitals, State of Georgia Office of State Personnel Administration, 
AT&amp;T, and the Former Bell South Corporation. Dr. Fedrick also served as 
the University System of Georgias Vice Chancellor of Human Resources.
  On August 14, 2018, the trajectory of Albany State University changed 
forever when Dr. Fedrick was appointed at the 10th President of the 
University after serving as Interim President and Executive Vice 
President. It has been said that: ``Education is the passport to the 
future, it belongs to those who prepare for it today. Dr. Fedrick 
used her time at Albany State to prepare thousands of young people to 
embrace their futures with confidence. She has done this by being a 
leader who has embraced focusing on the whole being of the student--
academically, socially and spiritually. Dr. Fedrick has expanded access 
and opportunities for students by increasing campus-wide resources. Dr. 
Fedrick has truly lived by the words of Mary McLeod Bethune when she 
said that ``We have powerful potential in our youth, and we must have 
the courage to change old ideas and practices so that we direct their 
power toward good ends. Dr. Fedrick has helped all students who have 
come through the doors of Albany State during her tenure to direct 
their power towards the betterment of humankind.
  Dr. Fedrick has truly advanced the University though a variety of 
initiatives to include a redesign of the universitys academic 
colleges, approval of the University System of Georgias first nexus 
degrees and the design and implementation of the Universitys 
integrated student success model. As a result of her ingenuity and 
visionary leadership, the University has achieved a sixteen percent 
increase in retention and a six percent increase in enrollment.
  Dr. Fedrick is widely respected by her colleagues because of her 
enduring commitment to student success, racial and social equity and 
the power of community. She has used her powerful voice to be a 
spokesperson for access, equity, and fairness. Dr. Fedrick has helped 
to strengthen the bond between Albany State and the greater Albany 
community. Dr. Fedrick has been associated with and contributed to a 
wide variety of initiatives in the University System of Georgia to 
include the mental health task force and The Georgia COVID-19 Health 
Equity Council. This initiative helped the Georgia Department of 
Community Health to improve its outreach to communities most affected 
by the virus. This ensured the fair distribution and administration of 
the COVID-19 vaccine.
  Dr. Fedrick has accomplished much in her life but none of it would 
have been possible without the grace of God and the love and support of 
her husband, Horace and her daughter, Grace.
  On a personal note, I have worked with many University Presidents 
over the years. Dr. Fedrick has been one of the most effective 
presidents that I will have worked with during my time in Congress.
, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the 
765,000 people of Georgias Second Congressional District in expressing 
our deepest gratitude and best wishes to President Dr. Marion Ross 
Fedrick for her dedicated service to Albany State University. May God 
continue to bless her and her family as she enters a new chapter in her 
remarkable life.
I rise today to recognize the 
Everett High School Rifle Team on winning the 2024 Pennsylvania 
Interscholastic Rifle Championships held in Meyersdale, Pennsylvania.
  The discipline, focus, and sportsmanship demonstrated by each member 
of the Everett High School Rifle Team are a testament to

their character and the exceptional coaching they have received. 
Through countless hours of practice and unwavering determination, they 
have honed their skills to perfection.
  Under the leadership of Coach Coltin Rice, the team has gone 
undefeated since 2017. Their dedication, perseverance, and unwavering 
commitment to excellence have propelled them to new heights, setting 
the bar even higher for future teams.
  On behalf of the people of Pennsylvanias 13th Congressional 
District, I congratulate the Everett High School Rifle Team, and wish 
them every continued success in the years to come.
I rise to congratulate the Hot Springs 
World Class High School Education Accelerated by Service and Technology 
(EAST) team on winning the 2024 Founders Award at the 2024 EAST 
Conference. This award is given to students who demonstrate a 
commitment to EASTs core values of authenticity, innovation, 
collaboration, dedication, and service. Mr. Speaker, it is evident that 
these students exemplify all of these and more. The teams 
accomplishment stems from an interactive map they created for the solar 
eclipse passing through the state of Arkansas on April 8, 2024. The map 
allows individuals to see all viewing options for this once-in-a-
lifetime event happening across the country. I am proud of the students 
for collaborating with the local community, working as a team, and 
accomplishing their goals.
  Im proud to recognize the students on this team and their EAST 
facilitator, Ms. Breanna Burris, for all their hard work on this 
extraordinary project. They have not only achieved a prestigious 
national award, but they have simultaneously improved the lives of 
their peers in Hot Springs.
I rise today to recognize the seventy-fifth 
anniversary of the Texas Lions Camp in Kerr County.
  The Texas Lions Camp was incorporated as a 501(c)3 by the State of 
Texas on April 4, 1949. The polio epidemic was rampant during this 
time, and the Texas Lions were looking for ways to give children 
affected by polio a place where they could experience some normalcy in 
their lives. Congress passed two resolutions that authorized the sale 
of excess federal land surrounding the Kerrville Veterans Hospital. One 
of my predecessors, Congressman Ovie Clark Fisher, was instrumental in 
the passage of this legislation. Then-Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson was 
also an early supporter of Texas Lions Camp. Mr. Bill Mickelsen, a Lion 
from Kerrville, traveled tirelessly to Washington D.C. to advocate for 
the ``Texas Lions League for Crippled Children camp in Texas. Mr. 
Mickelsen and his friend J.C. ``Buddy Murray created a detailed scale 
model of the Camp and eventually constructed the buildings.
  However, one of the strings attached to the sale of five hundred and 
four acres was that the Lions had to raise $100,000 within six months 
to guarantee construction. In pursuit of these dollars, the Lions 
established their ``life membership status. A Lion was Governor of 
Texas at the time, Allan Shivers. He broadcasted over the radio a call 
for donations to the Camp. Mr. Jack Wiech served as the first president 
of Texas Lions Camp in Kerrville. He went on a speaking tour across the 
State to drum up donations. As the six-month deadline loomed, the Lions 
were still $20,000 short of their goal. Mr. Sealy McCreless of San 
Antonio wrote a check that pushed the Lions over their goal for the 
Camp fundraiser.
  The next step was to begin construction and raise $150,000 to cover 
those costs. The Lions hit the road again for a second fundraising 
campaign.
, the Lions Clubs International president at the time, 
said the Camp for special needs children ``is the best example of 
Lionism in action. Mr. Petry went on to say that ``what is being done 
in Kerrville under the banner of Texas Lionism must be pleasing in the 
sight of Him Who first taught us to serve, to be our brothers keeper, 
and to put the Golden Rule into practice.
-scale model. Famous 
Kerrville names, including Hal Peterson and Howard Butt of the HEB 
Grocery Company, donated resources to round out the construction and 
supplies for Camp.
  Over the years, the Camp adapted to allow other special-needs 
children to participate. Children living with blindness, hearing and 
speaking disorders, and various crippled limbs all enjoyed Texas Lions 
Camp together. This defied the original prognostications of 
psychologists in the 1950s, who believed children with varying 
disabilities could not get along. However, they learned to help each 
other and combine their strengths to thrive. Several hundred adult 
blind were also trained at the Camp through a contract with the State 
of Texas for a couple decades into the 1980s.
  Every summer, children with physical handicaps such as diabetes, down 
syndrome, polio, missing limbs, blindness, and other disabilities are 
accommodated every year at a weeklong camp session at no cost to their 
families. Over 82,000 children have attended Texas Lions Camp since it 
opened in 1949. The Camp motto is ``All Can Do! Campers experience a 
zip line, climbing wall, ropes course, fishing, boating, swimming, 
archery, arts and crafts, miniature golf, and much more. Therapeutic 
horseback riding was added in the 1980s and became a favorite pastime 
for campers. A more recent addition is the family camping experience, 
allowing the families of kids with special needs to experience Texas 
Lions Camp.
  On a more personal note, my grandfather was afflicted by polio, and 
my grandmother was his devoted caregiver. I will never forget their 
sacrificial love for one another and my family. I am grateful to the 
eight hundred Texas Lions Clubs International that work tirelessly to 
provide funds for children with special needs to attend Texas Lions 
Camp.
