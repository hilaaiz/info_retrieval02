CELEBRATING MOUNTAIN LAKE FIRE COMPANY AND LADIES AUXILIARYS 75TH 
                             of new jersey
I rise today to congratulate the 
Mountain Lake Fire Company and Ladies Auxiliary on their 75-year 
anniversary. A team of 25 volunteers including firefighters, Emergency 
Medical Technicians (EMTs), and first responders, the Mountain Lake 
Fire Company has generously supported the communities of both Liberty 
and White Townships during any and all kinds of emergencies. The 
Company was founded in 1949 with a single small fire truck, and over 
the past 75 years the Company has grown into a pillar of the community, 
from bringing townspeople together for their annual car show to 
educating children on fire safety. Reflecting on their dedicated 
service, it is no surprise that the Mountain Lake Fire Company and 
Ladies Auxiliary is still thriving after 75 years. As a former 
volunteer firefighter myself, I am honored to have such dedicated first 
responders and community members in the 7th Congressional District, and 
I look forward to seeing them continue to flourish in years to come.
I rise today to recognize and commend the 
dedication and hard work of an outstanding employee, Stella Jimenez, as 
I bid her farewell as she moves on to the next step of her career.
  Stella Jimenez brought a wealth of experience and an unwavering 
commitment to community service.
  Stellas journey was characterized by her unwavering dedication to 
enact positive change.
  In her capacity as District Director, Stella assumed a pivotal role 
in leading diverse initiatives aimed at enhancing the well-being of 
residents in Imperial and Riverside Counties.
  Stella demonstrated a profound understanding of the communitys needs 
and challenges. Her leadership, characterized by a unique combination 
of grace and effectiveness, garnered admiration and respect from 
colleagues and constituents alike.
  Stellas dedication to community engagement was unparalleled. Whether 
it was championing the proposed Chuckwalla National Monument or 
ensuring full stakeholder engagement in Imperial County, she approached 
each initiative with unwavering determination and a genuine desire to 
make a difference.
  Stellas influence extended to coordinating high-profile events, such 
as the Department of Homeland Securitys visit to present the 
Outstanding Citizen by Choice Initiative Award by Secretary Alejandro 
Mayorkas.
  Under her guidance, these events not only achieved success but also 
carried a deeply personal touch, reflecting Stellas commitment to 
meaningful engagement and connection.
  Collaborating closely with the staff of White House Senior Advisor 
Mitch Landrieu, Stella facilitated impactful visits to various sites.
  Through her efforts, she fostered community dialogue and left a 
lasting impact, further solidifying her reputation as a dedicated and 
effective advocate for change.
  Stellas colleagues referred to her as someone who was always 
reachable, willing to advocate for them, and someone who went above and 
beyond to go across the aisle and work with local and state partners to 
help a constituent in need.
  She empowered others to navigate challenges with newfound assurance 
and strength.
  The impact of Stellas mentorship on many is immeasurable. Her 
guidance not only shaped others professional trajectories but left an 
indelible mark on their personal development as well.
  I am profoundly grateful for the privilege of working with Stella 
Jimenez.
  Through her tireless efforts and unwavering passion, Stella Jimenez 
stood as a beacon of inspiration, leaving an enduring and profound 
impact on the communities she served. Her legacy continues to inspire 
others to strive for positive change and to make a difference in the 
world around them.
  I look forward to seeing what Stella Jimenez does next and know that 
she will continue to inspire those around her.
I rise to celebrate the extraordinary 
heroism displayed by Timberline Lodge employees and first responders 
from Hoodland Fire, Clackamas Fire, Estacada Fire, Portland Fire, 
Gresham Fire and the United States Forest Service.
  In the middle of the night on April 18, 2024, a fire was detected in 
the attic of the historic Timberline Lodge on Oregons iconic Mount 
Hood. Lodge staff jumped into action with fire extinguishers and safely 
evacuated guests who were staying at the Lodge, many of whom were 
roused from their sleep to be escorted out. Fire crews from around the 
mountain arrived in record time to battle the blaze and protect 
Timberline Lodge, a national historic treasure.
  Constructed in 1937, Timberline Lodge stands on the south slope of 
Mount Hood at an elevation of 6,000 feet. Iconic and awe-inspiring in 
its architecture and design, it is a tribute to the rugged spirit of 
the Pacific Northwest. The Lodge was declared a National Historic 
Landmark in 1977 and is one of Oregons most popular tourist 
attractions, drawing nearly two million visitors every year.
  The quick thinking, bravery, and exemplary effort by both staff and 
first responders ensured that fire damage was limited to the attic and 
that all the guests made it out safely with no injuries reported. To 
think, we couldve lost this national treasure if it wasnt for the 
courageous actions of a few brave souls. I am forever grateful for 
their response.
I rise today to honor a 
remarkable servant, Fredrick Tidwell.
  Fredrick ``Fred Tidwell hails from Grenada, Mississippi, where he 
was born to Tinal Lott Rias and Fredrick Tidwell, Sr. Fred graduated 
from Grenada High School in 2018, where he distinguished himself as the 
Vice President of the Class of 2018.
  Deeply rooted in his community, Fred is an active member of Mt. Olive 
Pentecostal Holiness Church, where he serves as one of the youth 
leaders, demonstrating his commitment to both faith and leadership.
  Continuing his education journey, Fred attended Northwest Community 
College, earning an associate of arts degree in 2020. He then pursued 
his passion for social work at the University of Mississippi, 
graduating with a Bachelor of Applied Science. Currently, Fred achieved 
another milestone by receiving his masters degree in higher education 
administration.

  Driven by his aspirations, Fred envisions a future where he plays a 
significant role in higher education, aspiring to become Vice President 
of a Historically Black College or University. With his dedication, 
leadership skills, and academic achievements, Fred is headed to make a 
lasting impact in his community and beyond.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. 
Frederick Tidwell for his dedication and tenacity to serving his 
community and desire to be an example for all.
I rise today to honor a 
trailblazer in the realm of education and civil rights, John L. Barnes.
  A native of Charleston, MS, John grew up about 10 miles north of 
Charleston and attended Sherman Creek Elementary School. He was also 
the valedictorian of his 1964 graduating class at Allen-Carver High 
School.
  He courageously shattered racial barriers while pursuing his 
education at Mississippi State University (MSU). During his time at 
MSU, John encountered significant challenges due to racial prejudice 
and discrimination. As one of the first African American students at 
the university, he faced hostility, exclusion, and limited 
opportunities. Despite these obstacles, John persevered, contributing 
to the gradual transformation of MSUs campus climate. His courage and 
resilience paved the way for future generations of students seeking 
equal access to education.
  His enrollment at MSU in 1965 marked a significant milestone, as he 
became the first African American student to graduate from the 
university, June 2, 1968. He received a Bachelor of Arts from the MSU 
College of Arts and Sciences. His brother, Aaron was the third African 
American to graduate from MSU. After graduating from MSU, he briefly 
taught at Allen-Carver School before embarking on his corporate career 
in New York City. His achievements as the first African American 
graduate from MSU and his subsequent professional path demonstrate 
resilience and determination.
  While specific achievements beyond this groundbreaking moment may not 
be widely documented, Johns legacy remains an inspiration for those 
who continue to fight for educational equity and social justice.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing John L. 
Barnes for his dedication to advocacy in education, civil rights, his 
courage and perseverance.
I rise today to acknowledge 
and commend the remarkable achievements of Karmen Ashlee Bernard, a 
trailblazing student from Yazoo City High School.
  Karmen has made history by becoming the first student from Yazoo City 
High School to fulfill all requirements for an Associate of Arts Degree 
from Holmes Community College before graduating high school. This 
monumental accomplishment is a testament to her exceptional scholarly 
abilities, relentless dedication, and unwavering perseverance.
  Throughout her time at Yazoo City High School, Karmen has 
distinguished herself as a scholar of extraordinary caliber. Her 
participation in dual enrollment courses at Holmes Community College 
has not only showcased her commitment to academic excellence but has 
also set a remarkable example for future generations of students. 
Karmens dedication is further evidenced by her consistent placement on 
both the Presidents and Deans Lists at Holmes Community College, 
highlighting her tireless work ethic and intellectual prowess.
  In addition to her academic achievements, Karmen has been inducted 
into Phi Theta Kappa, an esteemed organization that recognizes high-
achieving college students. This honor reflects her outstanding 
academic performance and commitment to the values of scholarship, 
leadership, and service.
  Karmen has expressed deep gratitude for the opportunities provided by 
Holmes Community College, stating, ``I am incredibly honored and 
humbled to have had the opportunity to pursue my academic interests at 
Holmes Community College. Completing my associates degree before 
graduating from high school has been a truly transformative experience, 
and I am grateful to God and for the support of my teachers, mentors, 
and family throughout this journey.
  As Karmen prepares to begin her undergraduate studies at Prairie View 
A&amp;M University in the fall, she will major in Chemistry with a 
concentration in Biomedical Sciences. Thanks to her dual-enrollment 
credits, Karmen will enter as a Junior, fast-tracking her path towards 
achieving her goal of becoming an orthodontist.
  Karmen Ashlee Bernard serves as an inspiration to her peers and the 
entire community, embodying the values of scholarship, leadership, and 
perseverance. Her historic achievement at Yazoo City High School paves 
the way for future students to aspire to and achieve their highest 
academic goals.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Karmen 
Ashlee Bernards exceptional accomplishments and wish her continued 
success as she embarks on her next chapter at Prairie View A&amp;M 
University. Her story is a testament to the power of ambition and the 
importance of supporting our students in their educational endeavors.
Mr, Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
remarkable individual, Ms. Linda Keys.
  Linda Keys was born in July 1955 to the late Willie and Mary Phipps 
Keys. She grew up in a rural farming community where hard work and 
familial support were fundamental values. Being the youngest of seven 
children, Linda witnessed her parents dedication firsthand. Her father 
worked tirelessly as a farmer to provide the necessities of life, while 
her mother juggled he roles of homemaker and wage earner, demonstrating 
an unparalleled work ethic.
  Raised in Mississippi Lindas upbringing instilled in her a drive for 
academic excellence and a belief in the transformative power of 
education. She graduated from Quitman County High School (QCHS) in 
Marks, Mississippi, in 1973 and then pursued higher education at St. 
Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri, where she obtained a Bachelor 
of Arts in Education in 1978.
   Although Linda initially aspired to become an educator, her path 
took an unexpected turn when she was offered a full-time position at 
Ford Motor Company after completing internships. Embracing the 
opportunity Linda embarked on a career that required her to balance the 
demands of work. education. and motherhood with unwavering 
determination.
  After the passing of her husband in 2012, Linda transitioned into a 
retired lifestyle until her mothers declining health prompted her to 
move back to Mississippi in 2015. It was during this period that 
Lindas compassion for the less fortunate was reignited, as she 
witnessed children enduring the bitter cold without adequate clothing.
  Motivated to make a difference, Linda founded Mississippi Coats4Kidz 
in January 2016, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing coats, 
blankets, and other essentials to children living in poverty across 
Mississippi. Through her steadfast leadership and the support of 
various stakeholders, including grants, sponsors, and donors, Lindas 
organization has distributed over 100,000 coats to date offering warmth 
and hope to countless children in need.
  Lindas philanthropic efforts have garnered recognition and 
accolades, including certificates of recognition from the Mississippi 
State Senate awards from organizations such as Men United and WMC 
Action News 5, and the prestigious Governors Initiative for Volunteers 
of Excellence award in 2022.
  In addition to her charitable endeavors, Linda is an active member of 
various professional and nonprofit associations, including National 
Association of Professional Women and the Mississippi Alliance of 
Nonprofits. She is a devout believer in the power of faith and 
community and attends Pleasant Grove M.B. Church in Crenshaw, 
Mississippi, where she finds spiritual guidance under the leadership of 
Pastor Prez Jackson.
  As Linda continues her mission to serve the vulnerable members of her 
community, her unwavering commitment to making a difference, one coat 
at a time, stands as a testament to the transformative impact of 
compassion and resilience.
, I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing Ms. 
Linda Keys for her service to the community.
I rise today to honor the life of Coach 
Doug Blevins, who passed away on March 9th, at the age of 60.
  Coach Blevins was born with cerebral palsy. While his condition 
confined him to a wheelchair for his life, he was not deterred in 
pursuing a career in the sport of football.
  As a student at Abingdon High School, Mr. Blevins served as a student 
assistant coach, specializing in the kicking game. He would continue 
his education at Virginia Highlands Community College, University of 
Tennessee, and Emory &amp; Henry University seeking more student coaching 
opportunities. Coach Blevins would stay close to home, starting his own 
consulting firm and assisting prospective kicking talents at summer 
camps, clinics and more.
  In 1994, Coach Blevins was hired to be a consultant for the New York 
Jets. He would go on to coach for several years in the National 
Football League, working for the Miami Dolphins and NFL Hall of Fame 
Coach Jimmy Johnson, New England Patriots and Minnesota Vikings. From 
1995 to 2000, he served as kicking coordinator for the NFL Europe 
League. He earned the remarkable achievement of becoming the NFLs 
first-ever disabled coach.
a coach caught the attention of many talented 
kickers dreaming of playing in the NFL. Modern-day kicking legends, 
Adam Vinatieri and Justin Tucker, are just two of 26 current and former 
NFL kickers and punters who were trained and mentored by Coach Blevins.
  Coach Blevins years of hard work and tutoring prompted a significant 
recognition from the NFL community: his nomination to the NFL Pro 
Football Hall of Fame. Perhaps, someday he will be inducted.
  Most recently, he served as the kicking specialist at East Tennessee 
State University (ETSU), his alma mater, and as a volunteer assistant 
on the football staff at Science Hill High School.
  Coach Blevins inspirational journey from Southwest Virginia to the 
NFL, and his contributions to the sport of football, will not be 
forgotten--along with his kindness and compassion for others. Despite 
his lifelong disability, Coach Blevins followed his dreams of coaching 
football and helped scores of young football players develop and 
succeed in the sport. May his legacy live on.

life and legacy of Dr. Stephen Pappas. A lifelong Washingtonian, 
Stephen was born in 1930 to the late Steve and Georgia Pappas and was a 
proud graduate of Western High followed by his ophthalmology residency 
at Episcopal Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. In 1961, Dr. Pappas 
completed his clinical fellowship in the retina service at Harvards 
teaching hospital, Massachusetts Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary, in Boston. He 
returned to Washington as the first formally fellowship-trained retina 
specialist in the region. A deeply patriotic American, Dr. Pappas was
