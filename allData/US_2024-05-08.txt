             CELEBRATING 175 YEARS OF TOLEDO PUBLIC SCHOOLS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARCY KAPTUR

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 8, 2024

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of a milestone in our 
region&#x27;s history. Toledo Public Schools celebrated 175 years of 
education today.
  As the school system notes, ``or 175 years, Toledo Public Schools has 
been one of the most influential institutions in the history of our 
city. The lives of hundreds of thousands of Toledoans have been formed 
within the walls of their neighborhood schools, leading to each one&#x27;s 
mark on the future of our society. From its inception on May 8, 1849 to 
present day, TPS remains a progressive, forward-thinking school 
district.&#x27;&#x27;
  The first Toledo Public School Board was convened 175 years ago 
today. Only two years later, in 1851, Lagrange School was the first 
school to open. Two years after that, on August 15, 1853, the 
cornerstone was laid for the high school. When it opened in 1854 it 
also provided an education for girls, graduating the first young lady 
in the original Class of 1857. Leading social change again and again, 
Toledo Public Schools became integrated in 1871 and opened a school for 
children with disabilities in 1918.

[[Page E469]]

  Toledo has long been at the forefront of the election of women to 
public office, starting with the election of Pauline Steinem to the 
board of education in 1904, the first woman elected any office in the 
city. Many years later, in 1990 Toledo Public Schools would once again 
prove itself a progressive agent for change with the appointment of Dr. 
Crystal Ellis, a longtime educator, as the first African-American 
Superintendent.
  In addition to academic excellence, vocational and college 
preparatory training, Toledo Public Schools&#x27; students have won praise 
on the athletic field as well. From its beginnings, when Scott High 
School was declared the national football champs in 1916 and subsequent 
years, Toledo Public Schools have boasted many powerhouse athletic 
teams. At the same time, leading citizens in our community trace part 
of their success to the lessons learned in Toledo Public Schools.
  Reflecting the general population growth during the baby boom 
generation, Toledo Public Schools saw its highest numbers of both 
schools and students during the 1960s. Even now, it remains one of the 
area&#x27;s largest employers and the fourth largest school district in the 
State of Ohio. Today, Toledo Public Schools is led by Dr. Romulus 
Durant, himself a product of Toledo Public Schools, who ably leads the 
school district&#x27;s navigation in the 21st Century, declaring students, 
teachers, parents, administrators, and community to be ``TPS Proud.&#x27;&#x27;
  Toledo Public Schools is the core of our city. Graduates of years 
past, present and future are tied to one another with an invisible 
thread with memories and experience connecting them.
  In the Fall of 1967, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. visited 
the student at Scott High School, delivering inspiring oratory. Since 
its inception 175 years ago, Toledo Public Schools has delivered on the 
promise of words Dr. King once spoke when he explained, ``The function 
of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think 
critically. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true 
education.&#x27;&#x27; As Toledo Public Schools marches TPS Proud into the next 
years, that goal remains strong. Onward.

  HONORING JUDGE DEAN A. COLVIN&#x27;S SERVICE TO MARSHALL COUNTY, INDIANA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RUDY YAKYM, III

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 8, 2024

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my friend and fellow 
Hoosier Judge Dean Colvin of Marshall County Superior Court No. 2 as he 
prepares to retire this coming September after more than 37 years of 
serving on the bench.
  Born and raised in Marshall County, Judge Colvin&#x27;s distinguished 
career in public service

[[Page E470]]

goes back 50 years to 1974. Starting out as a special deputy with the 
Marshall County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, a Plymouth Police Officer, 
Investigator with the Marshall County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, and Deputy 
Attorney General for the State of Indiana. Dean was appointed to serve 
the citizens of Marshall County as judge in 1986. In that time, Judge 
Colvin has dedicated himself to advancing the principles of justice and 
ensuring Hoosiers get a fair shake before the law.
  The Rule of Law tradition we have inherited helps secure individual 
liberty and promotes the conditions necessary for human flourishing. It 
is incumbent on us to do our part to make sure these principles of 
justice and Rule of Law precepts are passed seamlessly from one 
generation to the next. That mission is one Judge Colvin has embraced 
wholeheartedly and worked tirelessly to advance throughout his career.
  As Judge Colvin&#x27;s career comes to a close, I am reminded of the 
saying ``I like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives. I 
like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him .&#x27;&#x27; I 
believe this quote applies uniquely well to Judge Colvin. The Plymouth 
community and all of Marshall County are unquestionably better off 
thanks to this good man with a servant&#x27;s heart. I am also very happy 
for him personally in that with his upcoming retirement, Dean will have 
more time to devote to his three great passions in life in addition to 
his family: baseball, cars, and cooking.
  I join Hoosiers throughout Indiana&#x27;s Second Congressional District in 
expressing our gratitude to Judge Dean Colvin for his service, and in 
wishing him a very happy retirement and all the best going forward. I 
thank Dean.

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Mia Norton for 
her invaluable work as a congressional intern serving in my D.C. 
office. I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her hard 
work and recognize the meaningful contributions she has made to the

                                 ______

                         Wednesday, May 8, 2024

  Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to 
congratulate the Central Cabarrus boy&#x27;s high school basketball team on 
winning back-to-back 3A state championships. In recent years, the 
Central Cabarrus Vikings have been the dominant force to reckon with in 
North Carolina boys&#x27; basketball. Local Charlotte news anchor Jim 
Tritsch described it perfectly when he said, ``there is no defense they 
cannot breach; there is no level of dominance they can&#x27;t unlock.&#x27;&#x27;
  Led by Coach Jim Baker, the Vikings put up an astounding record of 
95-1 over the past three seasons. The Vikings&#x27; most recent win not only 
earned them a second consecutive championship but raised Central 
Cabarrus&#x27; winning streak to 65 straight games, the longest current 
winning streak in the country.
  Once again, on behalf of the 8th District of North Carolina, 
congratulations to Coach Baker and Viking Nation on this outstanding 
achievement.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 8, 2024

  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable 
contributions of Mr. Efrain Casillas, the Coordinator of Music Programs 
for the Tolleson Elementary School District in Tolleson, Arizona. For 
the past 24 years, Mr. Casillas has dedicated himself to the education 
and enrichment of his students, serving as a public-school music 
teacher and imparting his passion for music to countless young minds. 
Mr. Casillas&#x27; own journey exemplifies what it means to break through 
barriers to achieve success through dedication and commitment. Mr. 
Casillas has beaten the odds and was named the Arizona Teacher of the 
Year in 2024 by the Arizona Educational Foundation, representing the 
state of Arizona at the national level among many more recognitions.
  Mr. Casillas has had a profound impact on countless students, 
pioneering innovative music programs, including the district&#x27;s first 
Mariachi, Jazz, Marching, Concert, and Latin Jazz bands. As a native of 
Puerto Rico, Mariachi was not part of his musical heritage, but 
Casillas made it a priority to learn it because it is part of the 
culture of many of his students who are native to Mexico.
  Under Mr. Casillas&#x27; guidance, the Mariachi band has secured multiple 
awards, including the Tucson Mariachi International Conference Choice 
Awards for three consecutive years. Notably, his dedication led to the 
Mariachi band performing at the 2024 Annual White House Easter Egg Roll 
event and the marching band proudly participating in the Disneyland 
Parade. Additionally, Mr. Casillas directed the Tolleson Elementary 
School marching band in the Fiesta Bowl Parade for three consecutive 
years. Mr. Casillas&#x27; commitment and talent have garnered numerous 
accolades and awards, including being named the Tolleson Elementary 
School District Teacher of the Year in 2015 and nominated for the Life 
Changer of the Year Award in 2017. He has also received the Esperanza 
Award from Chicanos Por La Causa and Arizona&#x27;s Esperanza Latino Teacher 
Awards in 2018, along with the 2019 Music Teacher of Excellence 
Foundation Award by the Country Music Association. Furthermore, he was 
honored with the Music Teachers of Excellence from the Country Music 
Foundation Award (CMF) in 2020 and featured on the Kelly Clarkson Show.
  Mr. Casillas&#x27; dedication to music education and advocacy for public 
education were further recognized when he received the Phoenix Arts 
Hero Award in 2022. Mr. Casillas&#x27; commitment to music education extends 
beyond the classroom, as he is an active member of many notable and 
impactful organizations. He has also served as a presenter for the 
National Symposium of Multicultural Music at the University of 
Tennessee in Knoxville in 2004 and as a clinician for the 2024 Tolleson 
High School Honors Mariachi Music Festival.
  The highest honor Mr. Casillas has received is having many of his 
former students return to assist in the music program as teachers or 
instructors. His impact is now extending to more students.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Efrain Casillas for his unwavering 
dedication to music education, his outstanding achievements as a 
teacher, and his tireless advocacy for public education. His passion, 
talent, and leadership have enriched the lives of countless students 
and inspired us all. I join my colleagues in expressing our deepest 
appreciation for Mr. Casillas&#x27; contributions and in wishing him 
continued success in all his future endeavors.

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ross Freeman for 
his historic contributions to the Scientific and Technological 
communities
  One of the UP&#x27;s very own, Mr. Freeman grew up on a farm near 
Engadine. He graduated from Michigan State University in 1969 and 
received his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Illinois in 1971.
  Mr. Freeman invented the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), a 
computer chip which revolutionized programming as we know it. The FPGA 
created what came to be known as ``open gates,&#x27;&#x27; which allowed 
engineers brand new reprogramming capabilities to adapt to changing 
standards and specifications and make last second changes to designs.
  Mr. Freeman further revolutionized the tech industry with his unique 
hypotheses and worked to make those customizable chips affordable for 
everyone.
  His incredible life was unfortunately cut short at the age of 41, not 
long after his vision for the future began taking shape. However, his 
contributions to society are immense and will be remembered by proud 
Yoopers all across our great state.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ross Freeman for his 
contributions to both the Scientific Community and our Nation as a 
whole.

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Susie Bell of 
Canon City for being inducted into the Fremont Hall of Fame.
  Susie was a pillar in Fremont County and spent decades improving the 
community before her passing in November of 2022. Her many

County.
  Susie was committed to advancing education--she built several 
scholarships for current and future learners, supported early childhood 
development programs, and donated and volunteered for many events to 
promote the arts. Her tireless work and dedication to Fremont County 
did not go unnoticed. She will be missed, but her contributions will

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 8, 2024

  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the one-hundred 
fortieth anniversary of the Doss School in Gillespie County, Texas. It 
is the longest continually running school in the State and is located 
northwest of Fredericksburg.
  Alumni, faculty, and students of the Doss School will gather to 
celebrate this milestone on May 18, 2024. Its motto is ``The small 
school with a big heart.&#x27;&#x27;
  School board president Cecil Crenwelge had this to say about the 
occasion, ``The history behind Doss School is truly remarkable. As we 
celebrate the incredible history of the school and its many alumni, we 
also have an eye to the future that is very bright.&#x27;&#x27;
  The original building for Doss School was officially designated a 
Texas Historic Landmark in 1985. The first classes at Doss School began 
in 1884. Mr. Tom Nixon donated land for the construction of a school 
building. Upon completion, students at Squaw Creek and Onion Creek 
schools merged with Doss and shared the new building. The school 
further expanded with a new building in 1927.
  I would like to thank the Friends of Doss School for preserving local 
history and this community treasure. I wish the students and faculty of 
Doss School well in the upcoming school year.

                          ____________________

                    TRIBUTE TO DR. MATTHEW B. RETTIG

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 8, 2024

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to 
Dr. Matthew B. Rettig, Medical Director of the Prostate Cancer Program 
at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, 
Los Angeles and Chief of Hematology-Oncology at the Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center in Greater Los Angeles, on receiving the Department of 
Veterans Affairs&#x27; Office of Clinical Science Research and Development 
John B. Barnwell Award in recognition of his significant contributions 
to the field of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.
  Dr. Rettig began his Veterans Affairs (VA) career as a staff 
physician in the Division of Hematology-Oncology at the VA Greater Los 
Angeles Health Care System in 1996. He became a leader within the 
department, and his unwavering commitment to improving health outcomes 
for veterans diagnosed with prostate cancer led to the development of 
the VA Precision Oncology Program Cancer of the Prostate (POPCaP) 
network. Dr. Rettig is credited for fostering the partnership between 
the VA and Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF), which has resulted in the 
PCF committing $50M to support this program and expanding services to 
over 20 centers across the nation to meet the critical care needs of 
American veterans with prostate cancer.
  Along with his leadership of the Prostate Cancer Program, Dr. Rettig 
is also a Professor of Medicine and Urology at UCLA where he is 
training the next generation of clinicians and researchers. Dr. Rettig 
has dedicated himself to the future of the field, having generously 
mentored and trained over 31 residents, fellows, post-doctoral 
scholars, and junior faculty in veteran-centered clinical research, a 
majority of whom continue to serve the VA to meet the healthcare needs 
of veterans while also conducting their own independent cutting-edge 
research in various disciplines. The impact of his work is far-reaching 
and truly immeasurable.
  Dr. Rettig is ranked among the top ten clinical investigators 
nationally both within and outside of the VA and is a major asset for 
the VA and the veterans they serve. His expertise and achievements in 
genitourinary oncology and research are evidenced by invitations to 
serve on local and national committees and boards including the VA 
National GU Cancer Working Group Steering Committee, Brentwood 
Biomedical Research Institute, Greater LA Research &amp; Education 
Foundation, Department of Defense, and the Prostate Cancer Foundation, 
among many others. Additionally, he serves on an editorial capacity for 
13 scientific and medical journals.
  It is with great honor that I congratulate Dr. Rettig upon receiving 
the Barnwell Award, the highest honor conferred by the VA Clinical 
Science Research and Development Service, in recognition of outstanding 
scientific achievements in clinical research. I ask that all Members 
join me in congratulating Dr. Rettig on his award and his service to 
our Nation&#x27;s veterans.

                          ____________________
