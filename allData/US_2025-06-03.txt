  CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY&#x27;S 
          PARTNERSHIP WITH THE KRAKOW UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
milestone--the 50th anniversary of Grand Valley State University&#x27;s 
long-standing partnership with the Krakow University of Economics in 
Poland. For five decades, these two institutions have stood as a 
shining example of the power and promise of international collaboration 
in higher education, and I could not be prouder of the great work they 
have achieved together.

[[Page E510]]

  GVSU is a pillar of our community. Year after year, their commitment 
to academic excellence and innovation has led generations of students 
to reach their full potential. With a dedication to fostering global 
understanding, GVSU has always known the importance of offering 
students opportunities that extend beyond our borders, and they have 
worked tirelessly to connect their students with experiences that 
broaden their global understanding. This is why their partnership with 
the Krakow University of Economics is so meaningful--a true testament 
to their mission.
  This partnership began in 1975, at a time when the United States and 
Poland shared more differences than they did similarities. Still, they 
came together with a mission to educate, building a strong connection 
based on mutual respect and a shared goal of helping students grow 
through global learning. Over the course of 50 years, their partnership 
has helped foster not only academic excellence, but cultural exchange 
and understanding between our two nations. As our world becomes more 
interconnected than ever, this partnership continues to serve as a 
shining example of what can be achieved when we come together to learn 
and grow from each other.
  On behalf of Michigan&#x27;s Third Congressional District, congratulations 
to those at both Grand Valley State University and the Krakow 
University of Economics who have maintained this collaboration over the 
years. This partnership has touched the lives of countless students, 
faculty, and communities across the globe. Today and every day, we 
thank both institutions for their lasting impact on the communities 
they serve.

                          ____________________

              HONORING INTERNATIONAL HOUSE DAVIS (I-HOUSE)

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
International House Davis (I-House) as the organization celebrates 40 
years of service. Since its founding, I-House has helped make our Davis 
community a more welcoming and inclusive place by building cultural 
understanding and supporting international residents.
  I-House was originally established in 1981 to connect International 
students attending UC Davis to our greater Davis community. In 1984, 
the organization opened its permanent location at 10 College Park, 
which has since become a central space for cultural exchange, language 
learning, and public programming in our area. What began as a small, 
volunteer-led effort has grown into a well-established nonprofit 
reaching thousands of people each year.
  Each year, over 250 international residents participate in I-House&#x27;s 
English language programs. In addition, more than 2,500 individuals 
take part in the organization&#x27;s cultural events and community programs. 
These include music and dance classes, parenting groups, public 
speaking workshops, and the I-House World Tour, a program that features 
cultural traditions from around the world and partners with local 
organizations to deepen community ties.
  After the COVID-19 pandemic, I-House reevaluated its operation norms, 
and decided to begin work on expanding its programming and reaching a 
broader cross-section of our Davis community. The organization has 
since strengthened its support for immigrants, refugees, and newcomers 
by launching new English language offerings and volunteer-driven 
initiatives. It has also added more community-led cultural programming, 
including classes in Persian drumming, French and Peruvian dance, and 
other areas that reflect the diversity of its participants.
  Throughout its four decades of work, I-House Davis has remained 
committed to the values of community, curiosity, collaboration, 
culture, and belonging. These principles are reflected in the 
organization&#x27;s day-to-day efforts to promote civic engagement, foster 
cross-cultural understanding, and support individuals as they navigate 
life in a new place. Whether through language instruction, cultural 
exchange, or shared community space, I-House has created opportunities 
for people from many different backgrounds to learn from one another 
and feel connected.
  As part of its 40th anniversary, I-House has launched a community 
storytelling project titled ``40 Years of Stories,&#x27;&#x27; highlighting the 
organization&#x27;s history and its continued importance to the region. 
Under the leadership of Executive Director Shelly Gilbride and a 
dedicated staff and board, I-House Davis remains a trusted and active 
presence in the Davis community.
  Mr. Speaker, International House Davis has spent four decades 
promoting cultural exchange and supporting our international and 
immigrant communities. It is fitting and proper that we recognize the 
organization today for its 40 years of dedicated service to our 
district.

                          HONORING KATE MILLER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Kate Miller, the Executive Director of the Napa Valley Transportation 
Authority (NVTA). After 12 years of service at NVTA, Ms. Miller is 
retiring, ending her 30 year career in transportation and leaving 
behind a lasting impact on our Napa County community and the broader 
Bay Area.
  Born and raised in the Bay Area, Ms. Miller earned a Bachelor of Arts 
in U.S. and International Studies from the University of Washington and 
a Master&#x27;s in Public Administration, Urban Studies, and Transportation 
from San Francisco State University. She began her career in 
transportation in 2000 at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, 
where she worked as a Senior Planner before moving to AC Transit as the 
Manager of Capital Development, Legislation, and Grants. In 2012, she 
became Executive Director of NVTA.
  Ms. Miller&#x27;s leadership at NVTA has resulted in significant 
improvements to our Napa County&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. She 
led the passage of Measure U, a sales tax expected to generate $1.2 
billion over 30 years for local streets and road projects. Under her 
direction, NVTA completed the $56 million Soscol Junction Interchange, 
reducing traffic congestion and improving mobility. She also played a 
key role in expanding the Napa Valley Vine Trail, securing funding, and 
guiding its construction from Napa to Yountville and from Calistoga to 
St. Helena.
  Ms. Miller oversaw the operations of Vine Transit, which serves over 
600,000 passengers annually and connects Napa County to Vallejo Ferry, 
Amtrak, and BART. During the 2017 Tubbs Fire, Vine Transit worked with 
emergency services to evacuate residents and visitors while maintaining 
limited bus service, earning NVTA and its partners the Bay Area Metro 
(Grand) Award from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in 2019. 
The agency later provided similar emergency response efforts during the 
2020 Glass Fire. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Vine Transit also played 
a critical role by delivering meals to shelters and isolation sites, 
transporting high-risk individuals to quarantine facilities, assisting 
emergency staff, and ensuring access to testing and vaccination sites 
for those without transportation.
  Beyond our Napa Valley community, Ms. Miller has been a key voice in 
statewide transportation policy. She served as Chair of the Bay Area 
Partnership Board at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and was 
appointed to the California Transit Transformation Task Force, where 
she worked on long-term funding solutions and operational improvements 
for public transit. Ms. Miller is also a well-respected mentor, 
collaborator, and advocate for sustainable transportation. Known for 
her ability to bring together local governments, agencies, and private 
partners, she has strengthened Napa&#x27;s position in regional and 
statewide transportation planning.
  Outside of her professional life, Ms. Miller is a dedicated family 
member and friend. She has been married to her husband, Greg, for 21 
years and is a devoted aunt to her nieces and nephew Ashley, Natalie, 
and Wesley. A proud Napa resident, Ms. Miller is an cyclist and enjoys 
spending time with friends, sharing meals, and walking her dog, Lilly, 
through the streets of Browns Valley.
  Mr. Speaker, Ms. Miller&#x27;s leadership has improved transportation 
infrastructure, expanded transit services, and advanced sustainability 
efforts in our Napa Valley and beyond. It is fitting and proper that we 
recognize her contributions here today.

                 HONORING RALPH VIGIL&#x27;S LIFE AND LEGACY

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Ralph Vigil&#x27;s life 
and legacy. He lived a life of passion--passion for the protection of 
the water, the land, the ecosystems, and the community of our beautiful 
Pecos, New Mexico.
  The first time I heard Ralph, he was talking about the importance of 
protecting our land as a place for everyone and everything, including 
our wildlife. He repeated the dicho, or Spanish saying:

       ``Un poquito para mi, un poquito para vos, un poquito para 
     las criaturas de Dios&#x27;&#x27; (``A little for me, a little for you, 
     and a little for the creatures of God&#x27;&#x27;)

  as he spoke of how he farmed and left some of the bounties in the 
field.
  Ralph was colorful and strong in his language when he asked me and 
others in leadership if we would stand with the people and the places 
we all loved. (You all are laughing because you can hear him now.) The 
lands we love don&#x27;t fight for themselves. They need leaders like Ralph 
who understand our ``herencia (heritage), cultura (culture), y futuro 
(future)&#x27;&#x27;), to organize the parciantes, organize the meetings, 
organize the hikes, and the advocacy. He was a tireless advocate for an 
array of conservation issues, from the Caja del Rio to our beloved 
acequias to protecting the Pecos watershed. There aren&#x27;t many people in 
the Pecos Valley or in the conservation community who don&#x27;t know the 
great Ralph Vigil because if there was ever a problem to fix or 
knowledge to learn, he was the person to call.
  New Mexico is blessed with a beautiful landscape. Ralph understood 
this better than anyone because there wasn&#x27;t a day he wasn&#x27;t recording 
footage or capturing photos of this beauty. His social media was 
sprinkled with beautiful sunsets and sunrises, clean flowing water, and 
the oasis of green that evokes awe in our desert landscape.
  With his collaboration and leadership, some of the victories for our 
cultura, herencia y futuro include the moratorium on mineral 
development on state trust lands in the Pecos with Stephanie Garcia 
Richards, the two-year protection of the Pecos River Watershed from 
mining claims put in place by Secretary Haaland, and the inspiration he 
gave to leaders from Santa Fe to D.C.
  Love is at its most powerful when it is unconditional when nothing is 
asked in return and setbacks and faults do not diminish the passion. 
Ralph loved New Mexico&#x27;s lands and people unconditionally. Ralph was 
connected to the land and people of Northern New Mexico as if there 
were an umbilical cord that was never severed. He was connected to the 
land through his farming, his gentle care of acequias, and his 
protection of the watershed that in turn protected the water that is 
our lifeline. He embodied the definition of querencia (no translation--
a place where one feels safe, happy, and strong, a place where they can 
truly be themselves).
  He was a son, a father, a brother, an uncle and friend that everyone 
could look to for leadership and wisdom. Like so many, I cried when I 
learned of his passing.
  I am honored to recognize the legacy that is Ralph Vigil. We are 
living through a historic moment where we need leaders like Ralph whose 
ability to transcend and translate is needed more than ever. His legacy 
will not only live on in his beloved rural communities but, today, also 
in the records of our great Nation--a Nation that Ralph made endlessly 
better during his incredible life.

   HONORING SUNAYANA DUMALA FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO CENTRAL FLORIDA 
        DURING ASIAN AMERICAN &amp; PACIFIC ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DARREN SOTO

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Sunayana Dumala is an Indian immigrant who 
moved to the United States in 2007 to pursue her master&#x27;s degree, 
hopeful about building a new future and achieving the American Dream.
  While working as a data integration engineer in Olathe, Kansas, her 
life was tragically altered on February 22, 2017, when her husband, 
Srinivas Kuchibhotla, was murdered in a hate crime that shocked the 
Nation. In the face of unimaginable loss, Sunayana chose to rise with 
purpose. She emerged as a leading advocate for immigrants, founding the 
Forever Welcome Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting 
immigrant and refugee communities through advocacy, education, and 
programs that foster unity and bridge diverse communities.
  Through Forever Welcome, Sunayana leads dialogue workshops that 
create space for understanding and connection between immigrants and 
non-immigrants, and runs a family support program that provides 
emergency assistance to refugee and low-income immigrant families.
  Her advocacy has extended to national platforms. She has worked with 
Immigration Voice to advance policy solutions for high-skilled 
immigrants and participated in campaigns like Spread AAPI Love by Stop 
AAPI Hate.
  She has also been featured in national documentaries, including PBS&#x27;s 
``Healing Hate&#x27;&#x27; and ABC&#x27;s ``Divided States: Olathe,&#x27;&#x27; which highlight 
her journey and the broader fight against hate. Sunayana&#x27;s work has 
earned her honors, including the Heart Award by Med Ad News, the Peace 
Award from the Crescent Peace Society, and the Humanitarian Award from 
the Olathe Human Relations Commission.
  Apart from focusing on her foundation, since relocating to Lake Nona, 
Florida, in 2022, Ms. Dumala has been actively involved with Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders Coming Together (ACT), a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to civic engagement and community empowerment. 
Through her work with ACT, she is helping increase civic engagement and 
voter awareness across Central Florida.
  Sunayana&#x27;s story is especially remarkable considering that when 
tragedy struck, she had no immediate family in America, was not born 
here and was still learning the nuances of American culture. In the 
face of devastating loss, she had a choice: to turn away from the 
country that had become her home, or to stay and fight against hate.
  Her journey is a testament to resilience, compassion, and a deep 
commitment to building a country where everyone has a place to belong.

           HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HMONG EXODUS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th anniversary of 
the Hmong Exodus, the mass displacement and migration of Hmong people 
from Laos to the United States beginning in 1975.
  The Hmong people originated in North Central Asia before migrating to 
Southeast Asia to settle in Laos. Despite achieving independence from 
French colonial rule in 1954, their relations to foreign powers 
remained complex, particularly during the Vietnam War. From 1961 and 
1975, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), employed a secret army of 
Hmong soldiers led by General Vang Pao to assist U.S. war efforts 
during the Vietnam War era. Known as the Special Guerrilla Unit (SGU), 
they fought in the ``Secret War,&#x27;&#x27; often against insurmountable odds, 
to stop the spread of

[[Page E512]]

communism inside and beyond Laos. In one of the most devastating and 
traumatic wars in our nation&#x27;s history, the Hmong people bravely fought 
side by side with U.S. troops resulting in 35,000 SGU casualties.
  Following the Paris Peace Accords, all U.S. military personnel exited 
Southeast Asia in 1973, but General Vang Pao and the SGU remained. Laos 
was then split into three factions, but after the city of Long Cheng 
fell in 1975, the communist-backed Pathet Lao seized power and 
retaliated against the CIA-sponsored soldiers and their families. This 
forced an estimated 20,000 Hmong to flee to Thailand to avoid 
persecution before relocating to the United States. This marked the 
first wave of the Hmong Exodus, in which over 100,000 Hmong emigrated 
to the U.S. between 1975 and 1997. They settled primarily in 
California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
  Today, the Hmong population in the United States is approximately 
345,000. The City of Fresno has the second-largest Hmong population in 
the country, behind only Minneapolis, with roughly 35,000 people living 
in the region. To recognize their cultural, social, political, and 
economic contributions to the city, Mayor Jerry Dyer proclaimed May 
14th as Hmong American Day in Fresno. This day commemorates the 
anniversary of the final airlift that brought Hmong veterans and their 
families to the U.S. It also serves a reminder to celebrate generations 
of Hmong Americans and their contributions in business, education, 
government, healthcare, and public safety. Fresno also has the 
distinction of hosting the largest Hmong New Year celebration in the 
country, attracting over 100,000 visitors each year.
  In the 115th Congress, I introduced the Hmong Veterans&#x27; Service 
Recognition Act to secure burial rights in national cemeteries for SGU 
veterans. It was signed into law as part of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2018 and serves as a symbol of grateful Nation 
for the service and loyalty of the SGU soldiers and their families.
  Mr. Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in 
commemorating the resilience and enduring spirit of the Hmong people 
and their contributions to the United States over the last five 
decades. May their story be our story.

               NEWSLETTER FROM CONGRESSMAN CHUCK EDWARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents on the budget 
reconciliation process, reforming our education system, and bills that 
have been introduced:

       Dear Friend,
       Congress is working through a budget reconciliation process 
     to:
       Keep taxes low for families and small businesses
       Strengthen our borders
       Bolster our economy
       Support domestic energy production
       Make the federal government more effective and efficient 
     for the American people
       As a member of the House Budget Committee, I helped craft a 
     budget resolution that is serving as the framework to 
     accomplish an agenda that puts America First.
       Now that this budget resolution has passed out of the 
     House, it is up to the Senate to move it forward so that we 
     can deliver on the priorities that an overwhelming number of 
     Americans have been asking for.
       We are at a pivotal moment in which we can pave the way to 
     implement significant changes in policies to get our nation 
     back on track, and I will continue to support opportunities 
     to make life better for Western North Carolinians.
       Strengthening and protecting our education systems:
       President Trump took a major step forward in reforming out 
     education system by signing an executive order to shut down 
     the Department of Education.
       This order paves the way for education authorities to 
     finally be back in the hands of the states and parents who 
     know what their students need to succeed best.
       The historically high tax dollars funding the department 
     have not paid off, with repeatedly low test scores among 
     students, and it&#x27;s time that we take a hard look at the root 
     causes that are preventing students from achieving their 
     potential.
       The House is also working to protect our education system 
     with the passage of the Defending Education Transparency and 
     Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act 
     (DETERRENT Act). I voted for this bill to strengthen 
     oversight and disclosure requirements for gifts and contracts 
     with foreign donors or entities. If a foreign entity is found 
     to be of concern, for example--if they are connected with the 
     Chinese Communist Party--then this bill allows for contracts 
     with those concerning entities to be banned.
       The CCP should not have the ability to influence our higher 
     education institutions or students through expensive gifts 
     and large donations. This bill will stop the infiltration and 
     influence of bad actors on college and university campuses 
     and make our education systems more transparent by staying 
     focused on the core mission--preparing America&#x27;s youth for 
     the workforce.
       Bringing contaminated properties back to life in our 
     mountains:
       Many investors who are interested in developing properties 
     that have environmental challenges decide not to invest 
     because the cost of cleanup exceeds the business&#x27; benefit. 
     Due to the challenges associated with cleaning up Superfund 
     and brownfield sites, contaminated properties will sit 
     unoccupied for years.
       The current Opportunity Zone program, which offers tax 
     incentives for investors to redevelop areas that are 
     designated as ``Opportunity Zones,&#x27;&#x27; focuses solely on low-
     income communities and fails to consider the need for similar 
     investment in communities with additional hardships, such as 
     brownfields and Superfund sites.
       To address this overlooked issue, I introduced the 
     bipartisan Economic Opportunity for Distressed Communities 
     Act, to designate all Superfund and brownfield areas as 
     Opportunity Zones and to encourage the clean-up, 
     redevelopment, and revitalization of these contaminated 
     sites.
       If cleaned, brownfields and Superfund sites can be 
     redeveloped into new housing or business space, and promoting 
     cleanup and development of these sites will create jobs, 
     business opportunities, and increase property values in 
     Western North Carolina and nationwide.
       Supporting small businesses in the aftermath of disaster:
       The destruction left by Hurricane Helene has forced many 
     Western North Carolinians to depend on federal resources to 
     rebuild their homes and businesses.
       One obstacle that stands in the way of recovery is a 
     current law that restricts hurricane survivors from double-
     dipping in the disaster aid system by prohibiting folks from 
     receiving a ``duplication of benefits.&#x27;&#x27;
       Unfortunately, wrapped up in this law is limitation from 
     accessing federal loans and federal grants for the same 
     disaster. That means if a business owner receives a federal 
     disaster recovery loan from the Small Business 
     Administration, they are ineligible to receive a federal 
     recovery grant from the $1.65 billion Community Development 
     Block Grant--Disaster Recovery funding that I authored and 
     secured in the American Relief Act.
       Even though SBA loans are required to be repaid and CDBG-DR 
     grants are one-time payments to victims that do not require 
     repayment, the federal government views the two as a 
     ``duplication of benefits.&#x27;&#x27;
       That&#x27;s why I introduced the Helene Small Business Recovery 
     Act, which would temporarily waive loans from being 
     considered as a duplication of benefits for disasters 
     occurring in calendar year 2023 or 2024. This clarification 
     would provide an exemption to the duplication of benefits 
     issue for all WNC businesses that received an SBA loan from 
     Hurricane Helene.
       Hurricane Helene caused nearly $60 billion in damage in 
     WNC&#x27;s mountains, and the state of North Carolina estimates at 
     least $30 billion of the damage was to the economy and 
     housing. With damage far exceeding currently available 
     resources, our communities must be able to access every 
     possible dollar appropriated for Helene recovery.
       Congress must pass this bill so that disaster survivors are 
     not restricted from accessing critical federal aid needed to 
     sustain our region&#x27;s businesses and keep our families in our 
     mountains.
       Now accepting Congressional Art Competition submissions:
       The 2025 Congressional Art Competition is open, and my 
     office is accepting submissions from high school students 
     living in North Carolina&#x27;s 11th congressional district.
       The winner of the competition will have their artwork 
     displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year.
       After the Congressional Art Competition winner is selected 
     by a panel of judges, I&#x27;ll also hold a ``Facebook Favorite&#x27;&#x27; 
     competition posted on my official Facebook page, 
     @RepChuckEdwards, for Western North Carolinians to vote for 
     their favorite piece of art.
       The annual Congressional Art Competition is a great way for 
     students in WNC to showcase their talent, creativity, and 
     passion, and I hope you&#x27;ll share this with a high school 
     artist whom you know.
       For details about the competition requirements and to 
     submit your artwork, visit edwards.house.gov/artcompetition 
     or contact my Hendersonville office with further questions.
           With my warmest regards,
                                                    Chuck Edwards,
     Member of Congress.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Merlyn Lewis has made to our community through her 
work as an exceptional volunteer for Service Dog Alliance, an all-
volunteer non-profit, which promotes and supports the rights and 
responsibilities of service dog teams, businesses, and the community. 
Merlyn Lewis exemplifies servant leadership by empowering volunteers, 
the community, and individuals with disabilities to ensure safe and 
unfettered access for service animal handlers. Volunteering more than 
10,000 hours, Ms. Lewis has served as President of the Board and Lead 
Trainer for the organization. She currently serves on the Executive 
Board as Secretary/Treasurer. Ms. Lewis and her service dog, Sterling, 
have traveled throughout Florida as role models of what to expect from 
a well-trained team. She has assisted individuals with disabilities in 
becoming better handlers and in understanding how to follow state and 
federal law. Her training for health care professionals, first 
responders, government staff, and private businesses about the vital 
work service animals perform has reduced barriers to access in housing, 
employment, and places of public accommodation and increased community 
partnerships to combat the misrepresentation of service animals. 
Service Dog Alliance achieves its mission because Merlyn Lewis is on 
the front lines and in the trenches doing whatever is necessary to 
ensure the organization and those served have all that is needed to be 
successful.
  It is clear that Merlyn Lewis has made a profoundly positive impact 
on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive 
to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the outstanding contributions of Parvin Ahmadi, a lifelong educator 
whose 36 years of service in public education have profoundly shaped 
the lives of students, families, and educators across California.
  Parvin Ahmadi began her career as a classroom teacher in San Jose 
before taking on administrative roles in Fremont and ultimately serving 
as Superintendent of the Castro Valley Unified School District for the 
past decade. Her unwavering belief that ``nothing you do for children 
is ever wasted&#x27;&#x27; has guided her leadership and inspired a generation of 
educators to pursue equity, access, and excellence in every classroom.
  Over the course of her distinguished career, Superintendent Ahmadi 
has served as a teacher, principal, director, assistant superintendent, 
and superintendent--holding the latter position for 15 years. 
Throughout her journey, she has built inclusive learning environments 
by collaborating with school boards and communities to ensure that 
every student has the opportunity to thrive.
  Superintendent Ahmadi holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree from San Jose State 
University, a master&#x27;s in teaching from Chicago, and a master&#x27;s in 
educational leadership from Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California. She 
also earned a School Management Certificate from UCLA.
  In addition to her district leadership, Parvin Ahmadi has made a 
lasting impact at the state level. As President of the Association of 
California School Administrators (ACSA), she represented more than 
18,000 administrators serving six million students. She continues her 
advocacy as Past President, mentoring new superintendents through 
ACSA&#x27;s professional development academies. In 2019, she was named 
Senate District 10 Woman of the Year by Senator Bob Wieckowski and also 
contributed her expertise as a member of Assemblymember Anthony 
Rendon&#x27;s State Blue Ribbon Commission on Early Childhood.
  It is my honor to recognize Parvin Ahmadi for her decades of service, 
leadership, and enduring impact on public education. Her legacy is one 
of integrity, dedication, and a deep commitment to the belief that 
every child deserves a champion. We thank her for her remarkable career 
and wish her continued success in all her future endeavors.

 RECOGNIZING TOHICKON MIDDLE SCHOOL&#x27;S HONORING THE LEGACY OF VETERANS 
     FROM BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA AND THE USS NEW JERSEY (BB-62)

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound respect and 
admiration that I rise today to recognize the extraordinary efforts of 
the students from Tohickon Middle School, part of the Central Bucks 
School District, in Bucks County Pennsylvania, who have demonstrated 
exceptional civic commitment through their participation in the Central 
Bucks Veterans Recognition Project, the Library of Congress Veterans 
History Project, and the United States Navy Memorial Student Interview 
Program.
  These students embody the very best of American youth--curious, 
compassionate, and committed to preserving the legacy of those who have 
selflessly served our Nation. Through countless hours spent 
interviewing and documenting the personal histories of our Veterans, 
they have become stewards of memory, ensuring that the voices of our 
heroes are not lost to time but instead honored and heard by future 
generations.
  For over a decade, students from Tohickon Middle School, Lenape 
Middle School, Central Bucks High School East, and Central Bucks High 
School West have gone above and beyond the classroom. After school 
hours, they have dedicated themselves to capturing the lived 
experiences of local Veterans--contributions that now form part of a 
national archive of living history. These stories, rich with courage, 
sacrifice, and resilience, serve not only as a tribute to those who 
served but also as a powerful educational resource for all Americans.
  Today, I especially commend the Tohickon Middle School History Corps, 
led with vision and dedication by Dr. Fash, Mrs. Fox, Mrs. Girardi, Mr. 
Neely, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Pakstis. Under their guidance, students have 
conducted interviews with Veterans from every branch of the Armed 
Forces, spanning from World War II to the present day. Many of these 
Veterans had never before shared their stories on record. By capturing 
these memories, the students have created an irreplaceable bridge 
between generations--one that deepens our collective understanding of 
service, sacrifice, and patriotism.
  One particularly moving example of their work took place during the 
reunion of over 100 Veterans from the USS New Jersey, the most 
decorated battleship in U.S. Navy history Invited to document this 
historic gathering, the students traveled to the ship to interview its 
clew members--many of whom were returning to their vessel for the first 
time in decades. From September through May, the students meticulously 
crafted short documentaries that not only chronicled the Veterans&#x27; 
experiences but also honored their enduring legacy.
  These documentaries were presented on May 22, 2025, at the United 
States Navy Memorial in Washington, D.C., before an audience that 
included USS New Jersey Veterans, retired military personnel, and 
leadership from both the Navy Memorial and the Library my of Congress 
Veterans History Project. This moment was not only a celebration of the 
Veterans&#x27; service but also a testament to the students&#x27; remarkable 
ability to preserve and elevate the stones that define our national 
character.
  Mr. Speaker, the work of these students is more than an academic 
exercise--it is a profound act of remembrance and gratitude. Their 
efforts remind us that history is not merely written in textbooks but 
lives in the hearts and voices of those who lived it. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in commending these young historians for their 
dedication, their empathy, and their unwavering respect for those who 
have worn their uniform of the United States of America.
  I include in the Record the following who have documented the Service 
Memories of Veterans and their families from Bucks County, 
Pennsylvania:

       Dr. Matthew Fash
       Mr. James Neely
       Mrs. Bridget Fox
       Mrs. Amanda Girardi
       Mr. Marcus Smith
