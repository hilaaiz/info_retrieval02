I rise today to recognize a milestone year 
in the Toledo Zoos remarkable journey in my district. The Zoo is 
celebrating 125 years in our community with a series of events 
culminating in a special gala on Thursday, October 23, 2025. Rated the 
top zoo in our Nation, Toledoans are justifiably proud of our treasure.
  The Toledo Zoo began modestly in 1900 when Megan Cole donated a 
woodchuck for display at Walbridge Park along the Maumee River in South 
Toledo. The attraction was popular, and within the year, thanks to 
continued donations, the zoo had 39 animals in its collection. 
Unprepared to properly house and care for the growing collection, the 
Toledo Zoo built the Lion House in 1907. During these earliest years, 
when housing was a challenge, animal escapes were not uncommon.
  The Toledo Zoological Society was subsequently founded in 1913 to 
spark development. William H. Roemer was the first president, and by 
1916, the Toledo Zoo exhibited

471 animals. In 1922, the position of curator was developed, and the 
indefatigable Frank Skeldon was the first curator for the zoo. It was 
during this time that national recognition was pursued. Building 
continued, and by 1929, the Giraffe House, Carnivora Building, and 
Primate House were all housing the animals.
  Building continued through the Depression-Era WPA, so that by the 
1930s the Reptile House, Aviary, Museum of Science, Amphitheatre, 
indoor theatre, and Aquarium were all completed, along with structural 
improvements, the subway and zoo entrances.
  The 1940s, 50s, and 60s brought new adventure with the addition of a 
miniature railway, the publication of Safari magazine, the nations 
only indoor trout run, the development of waterways, and other 
improvements. By the 1960s, the Toledo Zoos collection included more 
than 3,600 animals.
  Facing significant funding challenges following the regions 1980s 
financial collapse, the Toledo Zoo was on the verge of closure. A zoo 
levy was initiated in 1980, and in 1981, Bill Dennler became the new 
zoo director following Frank Skeldons retirement. Under his tutelage, 
buildings were restored, a childrens zoo opened, the birth of two baby 
hippos was caught on tape, and China lent the zoo two giant pandas. 
People flocked to the zoo to view these wonders.
  The 1990s saw continuing innovation, community support, and national 
and global supremacy for the Toledo Zoo. By the early 2000s, the zoo 
was well into its successful breeding program, including the rare birth 
of an African elephant. Development continues to this day. There are 1 
Million visitors a year and 78,000 households hold membership. The 
highest in the nation! There are 16,000 animals from more than 680 
species, including 90 endangered species, and 73 Million dollars are 
generated for our local economy.
  The Toledo Zoo has arrived at its 125th birthday as the top zoo in 
our nation and a global leader in wildlife conservation and engagement 
in sustainable practices. There are forty acres of native plants and 
110 prairies planted at the zoo and around the region. More than 45,000 
students and families learn from tours, camps, overnights, virtual 
programming, scouts, and gardening workshops. The Zoo hosts Music Under 
the Stars in its lovely Amphitheatre, where people can hear the 
symphony and creative performers on beautiful nights. People from all 
over come to view the Toledo Zoos African Savannah, Aquarium, Arctic 
Encounter, Aviary, Rescue Roost, Cassoway Crossing, Conservatory, 
Flamingo Key, Kingdom of the Apes, Museum of Natural History, Natures 
Neighborhood, Penguin Beach, Pheasantry, Primate Forest, Reptile House, 
Tembo Trail, Tiger Terrace, Snow Leopards, beautiful flora, fun 
amusements, nourishing treats and the stunning Lights Before Christmas.
  The Toledo Zoo is an absolute star on the map of Northwest Ohio. It 
truly and uniquely lives up to its motto: ``Enjoy. Inspire. Educate. 
Act. Our entire community congratulates our wonderful Toledo Zoo as 
we look back on a fantastic journey and look forward to an awesome 
future.
I rise to celebrate a true Texas 
treasure, 200 years of the Port of Galveston. It is an honor to mark 
this historic milestone and to recognize the men and women, past and 
present, whose hard work, grit, and vision have made this port what it 
is today. I especially want to thank Rodger Rees and the Ports 
leadership for their stewardship of this vital gateway to the Gulf.
, Ive lived on the Texas Gulf Coast my whole life. Down 
here, ports arent just infrastructure, theyre the backbone of our 
economy. Representing seven ports, more than any other Member of 
Congress, I know firsthand how critical they are to jobs, commerce, 
energy, and Americas security.
  The Port of Galveston is a shining example. Established on October 
17, 1825, by the Congress of Mexico, it quickly became a hub of 
strategic importance. During the fight for Texas Independence, it 
served as the home of the Texas Navy, brave men who risked everything 
to secure freedom. That fight laid the foundation for Galveston to grow 
into one of the most important cities on the Gulf Coast. In 1940, the 
people of Galveston, proud, determined, and invested in their future, 
came together to purchase their port. That move secured local control 
and ensured the Ports place as an engine of growth for generations.
  From a vital shipping center to one of the busiest cruise ports in 
the nation, the Port of Galveston continues to adapt and expand. This 
fall, a fourth cruise terminal will open,

bringing more visitors, more commerce, and more opportunity for 
Southeast Texas.
  Two hundred years is no small achievement. The Port of Galveston has 
stood the test of time, through storms, wars, and economic change, and 
it has remained a symbol of Texas perseverance and prosperity.
, heres to the next 200 years of success for the Port of 
Galveston, for Galveston Island, and for the great state of Texas.
CELEBRATING ROGER CARPENTERS 75 YEARS OF SERVICE AS SCOUTMASTER OF 
                                of ohio
I rise today to honor a truly remarkable 
American, Mr. Roger Carpenter of Oak Harbor, Ohio, who just celebrated 
an extraordinary milestone: seventy-five years of service as 
Scoutmaster of Troop 316.
  Seventy-five years, thats three-quarters of a century of guiding, 
teaching, and uplifting generations of young people. Shaping their 
character, their sense of service, and their love for community. Few 
can say they have given so much of themselves, for so long, to a single 
purpose. But Roger Carpenter can. And he has done so with a humble 
heart, steadfast faith, and a pair of calloused hands that never stop 
building, fixing, or helping.
  At 97 years young, Roger remains active with his troop, recently 
repairing the very log splitter used to make the Scouts famous apple 
butter. This tradition has warmed both hearts and bellies at the Oak 
Harbor Apple Festival for decades. This festival, itself a celebration 
of community spirit, fittingly chose this year to honor Roger for his 
life of selfless service.
  He is believed to be the longest-serving Scoutmaster in our nations 
history. But beyond the record books, his impact is written in the 
lives of the hundreds, more likely perhaps thousands, of young men he 
has mentored. Many of them have gone on to serve their country, their 
neighbors, and their families with the same quiet strength they learned 
under his guidance.
  During this years festival, we presented Roger with a flag flown 
over our United States Capitol as a symbol of the deep gratitude we 
hold for his unwavering devotion to the values that Scouting and 
citizenship share: duty, honor, leadership, and service.
  As we constantly reflect on what it means to build a strong America, 
we must look to people like Roger Carpenter. Those who invest in 
others, who give without seeking recognition, and who, year after year, 
live the ideals they teach. His life is a testament to what one 
dedicated citizen can do to shape the moral fabric of a community and a 
nation.
  So today, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives and 
the people of Northwest Ohio, I extend our deepest congratulations and 
gratitude to Scoutmaster Roger Carpenter for 75 years of remarkable 
leadership, for his enduring spirit, and for reminding us all that 
service to others is the truest form of patriotism.
  I thank Roger for being a living example of the Scout Oath and Law 
and for inspiring us all to leave this world a little better than we 
found it.

Others(M2HO) exemplifies this exceptional leadership, as she mentors 
youth affected by gun violence and helps those in need. Alizes 
resilience has also taken her beyond the scope of her local work, as 
she has amplified issues of youth empowerment, environmental justice, 
and gun safety laws through various platforms, including Miss 
California USA 2024, Delegate for Miss Earth 2025, and as part of the 
Everytown National Training Team. Alize is a dedicated member of the 
community, an ardent supporter of youth opportunities, and her

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SUPERVISOR JAMES M. ``JIM HOLLAND
I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of the Honorable James M. ``Jim Holland, who faithfully served the 
people of Chesterfield Countys Dale District for nearly two decades 
before his passing on October 14, 2025. I had the honor of working 
closely with Jim and witnessing firsthand his deep love for and 
unwavering dedication to his constituents. His kindness, humility, and 
steadfast commitment left a lasting impression on everyone who knew 
him, and his influence will be felt for generations to come.

I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate Bethel Temple Church in Hampton, Virginia, on the occasion of 
its 70th anniversary. For seven decades, Bethel Temple has been a 
steadfast pillar of faith, service, and fellowship in the Hampton 
community.
  In the early 1950s, Reverend Beverly W. Fox, then pastor of Phoebus 
Assembly of God, led efforts to build a new house of worship. With the 
support of the community, a modest sanctuary was completed and 
dedicated as Bethel Assembly of God. In the summer of 1955, Reverend 
Fox and thirty congregants held the churchs first service, laying the 
foundation for a ministry that would thrive for generations.
  Under the leadership of pastors, including Reverends Howard S. Ryan, 
G.P. Hertweck, Gerald Ogg, Sammy Hayes, and Arnold Brown, the church 
grew in both membership and outreach. Expanding facilities, 
establishing new ministries, and adopting the name Bethel Temple 
Assembly of God reflected its evolving mission and growing 
congregation.
  In the decades that followed, Reverends Ron Johnson and Glenn 
Reynolds deepened the churchs community engagement through programs 
such as the Great Turkey Giveaway, Christmas Toy Giveaway, and weekly 
Community Dinner. These initiatives have benefitted countless families 
across Hampton Roads.
  Today, under the leadership of Senior Pastor Reverend Charles Ricks, 
Jr., and Pastor Lori Ricks, Bethel Temple continues to embody faith in 
action. Through partnerships with local organizations and tireless 
service for the Hampton community during the COVID-19 pandemic, they 
have strengthened the churchs legacy of compassion and service.
, as they mark this milestone, I extend my sincere 
gratitude to Bethel Temple Church for seventy years of faithful service 
and enduring impact on the people of Hampton.
I rise today along with my 
colleague, Congressman Mark DeSaulnier, to recognize and celebrate the 
retirement and career of Stacey Mortensen, whose visionary leadership 
has transformed public transportation across the Central Valley and 
Northern California.
  For more than three decades, Stacey has championed investments in 
passenger rail that have connected communities, expanded opportunity, 
and laid the groundwork for a more sustainable future. As Executive 
Director of the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission, she led the 
launch of the Altamont Corridor Express--ACE--in 1998, uniting San 
Joaquin, Alameda, and Santa Clara Counties through a first-of-its-kind 
commuter rail partnership. This complex initiative required building 
infrastructure and relationships across three different regions, a 
challenge Stacey met with innovation and unwavering determination. 
Through her work, Stacey helped establish the San Joaquin Joint Powers 
Authority and spearheaded the Valley Rail Program, securing nearly $2 
billion in funding and enabling major infrastructure projects such as 
the Stockton Diamond Grade Separation.
  Under her leadership, ACE has continued to evolve to meet modern 
needs, including the recent launch of a specialty train service to 
Levis Stadium for San Francisco 49ers games--an example of the 
flexible, community-responsive transit vision she has cultivated. Her 
efforts brought together more than 20 local and regional agencies to 
develop a shared vision for passenger rail in the Central Valley.
  In 2024, Stacey helped launch the Rail Academy of Central California 
(TRACC), a critical workforce development program that prepares young 
people for careers in the rail industry. Her deep commitment to the 
next generation is reflected in this initiative, which ensures the 
continued success and sustainability of our regions transit systems by 
investing in talent right here in the Valley. What truly sets Stacey 
apart is her deep belief in partnership and public service. Her 
collaborative approach has not only built rail lines--

it has built trust across counties, cities, and communities. Thanks to 
her leadership, thousands of Central Valley residents now have better 
access to jobs, education, and opportunity.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Stacey Mortensen for her 
extraordinary contributions and for her steadfast commitment to the 
people of Californias Central Valley.
I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Douglas M. Mancino, an esteemed attorney, civic leader, and 
philanthropist whose distinguished career and lifelong dedication to 
public service enriched countless institutions and communities across 
the nation. Mr. Mancino passed away unexpectedly on September 10, 2025, 
leaving behind a profound legacy of excellence, compassion, and 
integrity.
  For more than four decades, Doug Mancino stood as one of the nations 
foremost authorities on health care and tax-exempt organization law. A

Foundation in 1995 and served for 20 years as its Chairman of the 
Board. He also served as Commissioner, El Pueblo de Los Angeles

health care institutions that form the backbone of our society, 
ensuring they could better serve the public good.
He served as President of the American Health Lawyers 
Association, Chair of the American Bar Associations Exempt 
Organizations Committee, and Vice-Chair of Publications for the ABA Tax 
Section. He was a Fellow of the American College of Tax Counsel and 
served on the Editorial Advisory Board of Taxation of Exempts. A 
prolific author, he wrote or co-authored five books and more than 
ninety articles that advanced understanding of nonprofit and health 
care law nationwide.
  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Doug was a devoted husband 
to his wife, Carol, of 52 years, and was known as ``Uncle Spice to 
his many nieces and nephews. He was admired not only for his brilliance 
but for his kindness. He was a mentor to many, a trusted colleague, and 
a friend whose moral compass never wavered. His passing is a loss not 
only to the legal and nonprofit communities but to all who were 
privileged to know him.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Douglas M. 
Mancino, whose extraordinary life exemplified the highest ideals of 
service, scholarship, and compassion. We extend our deepest condolences 
to his family, friends, and colleagues. May his memory be a blessing 
and his example a continuing inspiration to us all.
