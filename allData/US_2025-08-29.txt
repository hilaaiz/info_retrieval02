           CELEBRATING COLONEL WILLARD ALVIN ``BILL&#x27;&#x27; BARNES

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of 
Colonel Willard Alvin ``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Barnes who is turning one hundred five 
years old on August 30, 2025.
  Colonel Barnes was born in Atkinson, Nebraska, on August 30, 1920. 
Raised by his maternal grandfather, Ole Torske, he was imbued with an 
understanding of the power of service, loyalty, and hard work at an 
early age.
  In 1942, Colonel Barnes bravely answered the call to defend our 
Nation by enlisting in the United States Army shortly after the attack 
on Pearl Harbor. He completed his training at Camp Shelby Joint Forces 
Training Center in Mississippi, where he then became a member of the 
85th Infantry, Custer Division. He was deployed to the North African 
Theater of Operations during World War II. Upon the campaign&#x27;s 
completion, he and his division traveled to Italy where they fought in 
three campaigns in the Rome-Arno region, the North Apennines and the Po 
River Valley.
  Following Colonel Barnes&#x27; service in World War II, he returned to 
Nebraska where he enrolled at Creighton University and earned his 
bachelor&#x27;s degree and Juris Doctor degree. Upon graduation in 1952, he 
began a twenty-eight-year career in the United States Air Force as part 
of the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps.
  Colonel Barnes&#x27; time in Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps sent him 
across the world in service to our country. Throughout his career, he 
served domestically in Idaho, Alaska, California, Washington, D.C., 
Illinois and New Mexico, and internationally in London, Madrid and 
Seoul. After nearly four decades of military service, Colonel Barnes 
retired, but his commitment to service did not end. He dedicated 
himself to serving senior citizens, unhoused persons and his church 
community.
  As rich as Colonel Barnes&#x27; military career is, so is his familial 
life. He was born to his mother Anna Torske Barnes and had two 
brothers, Olin Barnes and Raymond Barnes. He married Elaine Spielman 
Barnes on July 16, 1948, with whom he would spend 72 years of his life. 
They had three children, M.J. Barnes, Barbara Barnes and Kari Rugh. He 
has three grandchildren, Alex Barnes, Nicholas Barnes and Kalie Kyo, 
and one great grandchild, Katherine Millie Barnes.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the life and career of Colonel 
``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Barnes on his 105th birthday. I thank Colonel Barnes for his 
service to our country and the San Antonio community.

                          ____________________

    CONGRATULATING SABA ON THE GRAND OPENING OF ITS NORTH AMERICAN 
                              HEADQUARTERS

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate SABA on the 
grand opening of its new North American headquarters in St. Clair, 
Michigan. This nearly 60,000 square foot facility marks a significant 
milestone for a company that has grown into a global leader in 
adhesives and sealants over the past 90 years.
  Founded in the Netherlands, SABA has earned a strong reputation for 
innovation, sustainability, and industry leadership--particularly in 
the mattress and furniture sectors, where its adhesives are widely used 
across the United States. With a market share exceeding 50 percent, 
SABA plays an essential role in the products Americans use every day.
  The new headquarters includes a one-of-a-kind technical center that 
will serve as a hub for testing, training, and product development, 
reinforcing the company&#x27;s commitment to excellence and customer 
collaboration. This $4 million investment not only expands production 
and warehouse capacity, but also strengthens the local economy and 
supports job growth in Michigan.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud SABA&#x27;s continued success and leadership, and I 
am proud to welcome their expanded presence in St. Clair. I wish them 
the very best as they open this new chapter.

                    HONORING DORIS HAYWOOD-BRIDGETT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
tenacious, loyal, and self-motivated leader--Mrs. Doris Haywood-
Bridgett--a pillar of the Shelby, Mississippi, community and a devoted 
servant to Bolivar County for nearly a century.
  Born in 1935 in Boyle, Mississippi, Mrs. Haywood-Bridgett recently 
celebrated her 90th birthday. A lifelong resident of Shelby, she 
remains an active and driving force in her community. Her tireless 
commitment and continued contributions serve as an inspiration to all.
  Mrs. Haywood-Bridgett, alongside her late husband, Pastor Will 
Bridgett, Jr., made history in Shelby as the first African American 
business owners in town, opening Bridgett Bakery Shop. A licensed 
beautician since the late 1960&#x27;s, she has been serving her loyal 
clients for decades and has yet to fully retire. In addition to her 
professional work, she operated an in-home daycare in the 1970&#x27;s and 
1980&#x27;s and served as Site Manager for the Bolivar County Community 
Action Agency in Cleveland, Mississippi.
  Throughout her life, Mrs. Haywood-Bridgett has demonstrated an 
unwavering dedication to children and families. Whether through her 
daycare, her beautician chair, or simply her open-door policy for 
neighborhood children seeking help with homework, she has poured love, 
wisdom, and guidance into generations.
  Her service to the community extends beyond her personal and 
professional life. She served as Vice President of the Shelby Chamber 
of Commerce for over a decade, spearheading efforts to remove blighted 
properties, improve public spaces, and revitalize local infrastructure. 
Known affectionately as ``the neighborhood Mother,&#x27;&#x27; her home has 
always been a safe haven, a place of encouragement and support.
  With the election of a new city administration, Mrs. Haywood-Bridgett 
remains hopeful and engaged in shaping a brighter future for Shelby. 
Her unwavering faith in God keeps her grounded and strong, as she 
continues to pray for the strength to do what needs to be done.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend Mrs. Doris Haywood-
Bridgett--for a lifetime of service, leadership, and enduring 
commitment to the people of Shelby and Bolivar County, Mississippi. Her 
story is a living testament to the impact of a single life dedicated to 
service, and her legacy will echo for generations to come.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Garrett Evans 
for his more than 28 years of dedicated public service to the City of 
Pittsburg, California.
  Mr. Evans began his career with the city in 1997, serving in roles 
ranging from Analyst to Economic &amp; Redevelopment Coordinator, Director 
of Economic Development, Director of the Redevelopment Agency, Director 
of Power, Assistant City Manager, and ultimately City Manager for the 
past six and a half years. Under his leadership, Pittsburg has seen 
significant growth in economic development, infrastructure, and 
community services.
  Among his many accomplishments, Mr. Evans played a central role in 
the $525 million Trans Bay Cable project, delivering up to 40 percent 
of San Francisco&#x27;s energy from Pittsburg and strengthening energy 
reliability across the Bay Area. He also contributed to the success of 
the Pittsburg Power Company, generating over $100 million in long-term 
revenue for community priorities such as public safety, workforce 
development, and infrastructure improvements.
  His tenure also included the revitalization of Old Town Pittsburg, 
expansion of waterfront amenities, and maintaining high-quality city 
services through the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Garrett Evans leaves behind a legacy of steady leadership, strategic 
vision, and unwavering dedication to his community. On behalf of the 
constituents of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, I wish Garrett 
best wishes in his well-earned retirement and extend my sincere 
gratitude for his many years of service to the community.

  HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RIVERSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD PARADE

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary 
of the Riverside Neighborhood Parade on September 6, 2025. This is one 
of Indianapolis&#x27;s most treasured and enduring community traditions.
  The Riverside Parade began in 1925, when the city first paved Harding 
Street and more than 10,000 neighbors gathered to celebrate. Since that 
day, the parade has represented civic unity, community pride, and the 
rich cultural legacy of one of our city&#x27;s oldest neighborhoods. For 
generations, the Riverside community has come together every September 
to honor its history, celebrate its people, and look ahead with hope.
  Riverside is more than just a neighborhood--it is a community built 
on resilience, service, and shared history. With its early 20th-century 
homes and the newly completed promenade trail at Riverside Park, the 
area reflects the very heart and soul of Indianapolis.
  This year&#x27;s centennial celebration not only marks a historic 
milestone but also begins a new chapter. Under the leadership of 
Careena Jackson and the Riverside Civic League, the parade&#x27;s planning 
and stewardship have returned to the neighborhood&#x27;s hands. Their 
dedication to preserving this beloved tradition while building its 
future is a powerful example of community leadership in action.
  Featuring everything from marching bands and bike riders to school 
groups and local leaders, the Riverside Parade continues to inspire 
joy, connection, and civic engagement. It serves as a reminder of what 
is possible when neighbors unite with purpose and pride.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
Riverside Neighborhood Parade on its 100th anniversary. May this 
celebration honor the past, strengthen the present, and inspire the 
future of this remarkable Indianapolis community.

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life, legacy, and voice of a Mississippi treasure--Mosie ``Mama&#x27;&#x27; 
Burks, gospel music legend and beloved member of the world-renowned 
Mississippi Mass Choir. Born on June 17, 1933, in Forest, Mississippi, 
Mama Burks was one of ten children in a large migrant farming family. 
Her roots were humble, her work ethic unshakeable, and her faith 
unmovable.
  As a child laboring in the cotton fields under the scorching 
Mississippi sun, she experienced the hardship and perseverance that 
would later define her voice and testimony. Delivered from field work 
after suffering from heat exhaustion, Mama Burks went on to serve her 
community in numerous ways, including a 24-year career in social work 
at Jackson State University. But it was her powerful, soul-stirring 
voice and unwavering testimony of God&#x27;s grace that would make her a 
household name in gospel music.
  In 1993, Mama Burks joined the Mississippi Mass Choir and soon became 
the face and heart of the ensemble. Her passionate renditions of ``When 
I Rose This Morning&#x27;&#x27; and other gospel staples brought joy and healing 
to audiences across the nation and around the world. Her performances 
were more than music, they were ministry. With every note, she reminded 
listeners of the enduring power of faith, love, and perseverance.
  Mama Burks was not merely a singer--she was a vessel. Through 
countless concerts, worship services, and personal testimonies, she 
embodied the best of Mississippi&#x27;s rich gospel tradition. She shared 
her gifts humbly and generously, always giving glory to God.
  Now, therefore, as we reflect on her passing, we remember not just 
the voice, but the spirit of Mama Burks. A mother to many, a sister in 
faith, and a tireless servant of the Lord, she leaves behind a legacy 
that transcends music--a legacy of praise, perseverance, and purpose.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of 
Mosie ``Mama&#x27;&#x27; Burks,

[[Page E794]]

whose voice uplifted generations and whose life was a living testimony 
of God&#x27;s faithfulness.

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Thomas 
Durand, a dedicated and selfless leader in Michigan&#x27;s agricultural 
community, on his induction into the Michigan Farmers Hall of Fame.
  Thomas Durand has spent his life committed to Michigan agriculture. A 
lifelong farmer, Thomas, began his journey in the fields of Sanilac 
County, working alongside his father. In 1981, he established his own 
farm, where he continues to grow a diverse range of crops including 
sugar beets, black beans, wheat, soybeans, and corn.
  A member of the Michigan Corn Growers Association, Thomas served four 
years on its board, including one year as president. He also served 
nine years on the Corn Marketing Program of Michigan board, including 
two years as its president.
  Thomas&#x27;s advocacy has extended far beyond Michigan&#x27;s borders. He 
represented the U.S. Grains Council on a mission to Japan and has been 
a steadfast voice for Michigan corn growers in Washington, D.C.
  His agricultural service doesn&#x27;t stop at corn. Thomas has served 18 
years on the Michigan Sugar Company board, and seven years on the 
Greenstone Farm Credit board. He is also a lifetime member of the 
Soybean Growers Association and an active member of the Michigan Farm 
Bureau.
  Equally commendable is Thomas&#x27;s commitment to community. He has 
served as a township supervisor, school board member, high school 
basketball coach, and referee. He has also spent years broadcasting 
local high school sports on WTGV in Sandusky, further strengthening 
community ties through his voice and presence.
  In 2021, Thomas was honored with the Distinguished Service Award by 
the Michigan Corn Growers Association, a fitting recognition for his 
lifelong service and leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, Thomas Durand exemplifies the very best of Michigan 
agriculture and rural leadership. His unwavering dedication to farming, 
advocacy, and community service make him a worthy inductee into the 
Michigan Farmers Hall of Fame. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Thomas on this well-deserved honor and thanking him for 
his lifelong contributions to Michigan&#x27;s agricultural heritage.

  INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL POLICE CAMERA AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 
                                  2025

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative Donald S. Beyer 
Jr., introduce the Federal Police Camera and Accountability Act of 
2025. This bill would require federal law enforcement officers to wear 
body cameras and marked federal law enforcement vehicles to have 
dashboard cameras. It would also require the Government Accountability 
Office to conduct a study on federal law enforcement officers&#x27; 
training, vehicle pursuits, use of force and interaction with the 
public. In the 116th and 117th Congresses, the House passed this bill 
as part of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
  Cameras can increase transparency, strengthen public trust and even 
deter criminal behavior. With the surge of federal law enforcement 
officers in the District of Columbia this month, this bill has become 
even more important.
  We first introduced this bill after Bijan Ghaisar was fatally shot on 
November 17, 2017, in his car by U.S. Park Police officers in Fairfax 
County, Virginia, after a vehicle pursuit on the George Washington 
Memorial Parkway. Video of this shooting only became available through 
a camera in a Fairfax County Police Department patrol car that was 
providing backup. Had it not been for that footage, which was recorded 
and released by that local police department, the public would not have 
had access to the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ghaisar&#x27;s death. 
Moreover, the footage revealed concerns about the Park Police&#x27;s pursuit 
and engagement policies.
  Body and dashboard cameras for federal law enforcement officers are 
particularly important for the officers stationed in D.C., where the 
Park Police and the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division have full 
local police powers. Many other federal law enforcement agencies also 
have local police powers near their respective agency buildings in D.C.
  In 2022, President Biden issued an executive order (E.O.) requiring 
federal law enforcement agencies to use body cameras. President Trump 
rescinded this E.O.
  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

    MARKING THE 15TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST NUCLEAR TESTS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 29, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 15th annual 
International Day Against Nuclear Tests, observed each year on August 
29th. This day serves as both a reminder of the terrible human and 
environmental toll of nuclear testing and a call to action as the world 
confronts new dangers of nuclear proliferation and a fraying arms 
control architecture.
  The United States knows well the harmful legacy of nuclear testing. 
Between 1945 and 1963, our Nation conducted more than one thousand 
explosive nuclear weapons tests, including over two hundred atmospheric 
detonations. The radioactive fallout from these tests condemned 
thousands of so-called ``downwinders&#x27;&#x27; to illness and premature death 
from cancers and other grave diseases. Their suffering is a stark 
reminder that even a world without nuclear war is not without victims 
of nuclear weapons.
  In 1990, Congress enacted the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to 
provide some measure of redress to individuals harmed by nuclear 
testing. Yet the program was incomplete, excluding key populations who 
endured some of the most devastating consequences of atmospheric 
nuclear detonations. This program, providing long-overdue compensation 
to those who bore the costs of our Nation&#x27;s nuclear testing, was 
recently extended to 2028 and expanded to additional populations. But 
much more must be done to fully address the consequences of nuclear 
testing and to reduce the dangers posed by nuclear war.
  The burdens inflicted by nuclear testing are not borne by the United 
States alone. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, 
Kazakhstan inherited the world&#x27;s fourth-largest nuclear arsenal and the 
Semipalatinsk nuclear test site. Between 1949 and 1989, the Soviet 
Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk, devastating 
communities and leaving a toxic legacy for more than a million Kazakh 
citizens.
  Kazakhstan&#x27;s decision to close the Semipalatinsk test site in 1991 
and to relinquish its nuclear arsenal was an act of profound global 
importance. By ratifying the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), 
joining the International Atomic Energy Agency, acceding to the Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, signing the Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and working with the United States through the 
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Kazakhstan demonstrated how 
nations can choose security through disarmament rather than weapons of 
mass destruction.
  Together, our countries worked to eliminate Kazakhstan&#x27;s inherited 
nuclear arsenal, dismantle former Soviet nuclear infrastructure,

and secure vulnerable nuclear materials. Notably, this partnership 
resulted in the safe removal of over 1,300 pounds of highly enriched 
uranium from the Ulba Metallurgical Plant--strengthening global 
security and setting a model for future cooperation.
  Today, as arms control architectures fray and nuclear dangers mount, 
that example takes on new urgency. The world faces a moment of great 
peril: nuclear arsenals are being modernized, new technologies are 
emerging that could undermine strategic stability, and the norms 
against nuclear testing and proliferation are under strain. The vision 
of a world free from nuclear tests and the spread of nuclear weapons, 
advanced by Kazakhstan through their decision to disarm and continued 
commitment to a world free from nuclear weapons, is more urgent than 
ever.
  In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly designated August 29th 
as the International Day Against Nuclear Tests--honoring Kazakhstan&#x27;s 
decision and reminding the world of the human costs of explosive 
testing of nuclear weapons.
  Civil society, too, has helped illuminate what is possible. The 
Nevada-Semipalatinsk Movement, a grassroots anti-nuclear weapons 
movement uniting citizens across continents, helped build the momentum 
to end nuclear testing. We must draw on that same spirit today to 
reinvigorate arms control diplomacy, rebuild confidence in 
nonproliferation regimes, and press forward on treaties like the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
  On this 15th Annual International Day Against Nuclear Tests, I urge 
my colleagues to reaffirm our Nation&#x27;s leadership in arms control, 
recommit to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and materials, and 
ensure that the horrors of nuclear testing and nuclear weapons use are 
never repeated.

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished

of Texas and is a member of the International Association of Financial 
Crime Investigators and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. 
He enjoys spending time with his family and has proudly continued his 
family&#x27;s tradition of public service.
  I would like to thank Detective Haecker for his exemplary service to 
North Texas and congratulate him on his well-deserved retirement.
