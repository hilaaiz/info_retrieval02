I rise today to recognize 
and commend Mr. Don Hewitt, a trailblazer in sustainable urban 
development and a visionary entrepreneur whose work has made a 
transformative impact on communities throughout Jackson, Mississippi, 
and beyond.
(ATBS), established in 2004 and headquartered in Jackson. 
With more than 20 years of experience in real estate development and 
urban planning, Mr. Hewitt has consistently prioritized community-
centered solutions that emphasize walkability, environmental design, 
and economic opportunity.
  Under his leadership, ATBS has emerged as a leader in mixed-use 
developments that integrate green spaces, affordable housing, retail 
accessibility, and local business engagement. The companys initiatives 
frequently involve partnerships with public housing authorities, 
nonprofit organizations, and government entities--leading to the 
revitalization of underutilized spaces into vibrant, inclusive 
neighborhoods.
  Currently, ATBS is collaborating with the West Jackson Community 
Development Corporation and the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation to 
implement an innovative urban streetscape project in West Jackson. This 
development will offer affordable workspace for local entrepreneurs and 
startups, fostering economic opportunity and nurturing local talent.
As a participant in the AI Business Accelerator Cohort, 
he is integrating artificial intelligence into project planning to 
optimize sustainability metrics and enhance community engagement. His 
forward-thinking approach ensures that urban development remains both 
efficient and equitable.
, I am proud to honor Mr. Don Hewitt for his service, 
leadership, and unwavering dedication to building a stronger, more 
inclusive Mississippi. His work exemplifies what it means to develop 
with the community and for the community.
I rise today for two reasons: to honor the 
crew members who served aboard the USS Triton (SSRN-586) submarine, and 
to commend the Port of Benton for commissioning a new commemorative 
wall honoring the Triton and her crew.
  Commissioned in 1959, the USS Triton holds a special place in the 
history of the U.S. Navy. Powered by two nuclear reactors, the Triton 
was the first submarine to complete a submerged circumnavigation of the 
globe.
  During the Cold War, the Triton was a vital part of the Navys 
defense strategy as a leader in peace and security around the world. 
The members who served aboard her were at the forefront of this 
mission, often enduring long months of isolation and unpredictable 
conditions aboard the vessel. But their shared dedication and expertise 
led them to achieve one of the most groundbreaking missions in naval 
history.
  The USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park was formally dedicated in 
Richland, Washington, on November 10, 2011, to commemorate the 
submarine and her crew. Central Washington is proud to be home to this 
piece of our Nations history, and I thank the Port of Benton for 
honoring the crew members and preserving their legacy.
today, I introduce a bill that would make a 
small but respectful change to federal law by adding the Mayor of the 
District of Columbia to the list of named principals for whom the 
President shall order the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff. Current law 
states that the President shall make this order ``upon the death of 
principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a 
State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their 
memory. Surely the D.C. Mayor, who has the same responsibilities as 
governors of states and territories, should qualify as such a 
principal. This bill is part of our series of bills to ensure equal 
treatment for the over 700,000 D.C. residents. In the 116th Congress, 
the House Committee on the Judiciary passed this bill.
  Congress has already acknowledged that D.C. is entitled to a place 
among the states for certain honors. For example, legislation we got 
enacted gave D.C. a coin after D.C. was omitted from legislation 
creating coins for the states and required the armed services to 
display the D.C. flag whenever the flags of the states are displayed. 
We got D.C.s Frederick Douglass and Pierre LEnfant statues placed in 
the Capitol, alongside two statues from each state. We also 
successfully worked with the U.S. Postal Service to create a D.C. 
stamp, like the stamps for the states, and with the National Park 
Service to add the D.C. flag alongside the state flags near Union 
Station.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
I was unavoidably detained in my district at 
Fort Bragg and missed a vote. Had I been present, I would have voted 
YEA on Roll Call No. 160; YEA on Roll Call No. 161; YEA on Roll Call 
No. 162; and YEA on Roll Call No. 163.
I rise today in honor of Caribbean American 
Heritage Month to pay tribute to a distinguished community leader from 
Rochester, New York: Jerome H. Underwood.
  As Chief Executive Officer of Action for a Better Community and a 
founding member of the Greater Rochester Black Agenda Group, Jerome 
Underwood has led with clarity, purpose, and unwavering integrity. 
Throughout his years of dedicated service, he has been a moral compass 
and unifying force in our community, championing social justice and 
equity.
  Born on the Caribbean island of Antigua, Jerome brought with him to 
the United States a deep-rooted sense of community and justice. In 
Rochester, he has emerged as a tireless advocate for racial equity and 
economic justice, working to expose and dismantle the structural racism 
that continues to harm communities of color.
  Jeromes leadership extends far beyond boardrooms and policy tables. 
He is also a powerful role model for our youth. Merging his love of 
soccer with a deep passion for mentorship and ``peaceful demeanor, he 
has served as Director of Coaching for the River Flow Soccer Club and 
President of the Flower City Soccer League.
  It is with great pride and admiration that I recognize Jerome H. 
Underwood this Caribbean American Heritage Month. His unwavering 
commitment to equity, youth empowerment, and community transformation 
continues to uplift our community here in Rochester and beyond.
I rise today in honor of Caribbean American 
Heritage Month to recognize an exceptional public servant from 
Rochester, New York: Marlene Henry.
  As the owner of PeppaPot Catering, Marlene Henry is far more than a 
business owner--she is a quiet but powerful force for good in our 
community. Time and again, she has offered her culinary talents in 
service of others, often at her own expense. Whether providing food at 
no cost to those in need or offering discounted services for community 
events, Marlene exemplifies the spirit of generosity that defines 
Caribbean American heritage.

  Her commitment to service extends well beyond the kitchen. Marlene is 
among the first to volunteer for community events, including Caribbean 
American Heritage Month celebrations, Mothers Day initiatives, and 
cultural festivals. She approaches every act of service with humility, 
never seeking recognition, but always delivering excellence.
  Marlenes impact is also felt through her efforts to pass on cultural 
traditions to the next generation. She devotes time to teaching young 
people how to prepare and appreciate authentic Caribbean dishes, 
ensuring that the flavors, stories, and values of our shared heritage 
endure.
  It is my distinct honor to recognize Marlene Henry this Caribbean 
American Heritage Month. Her deep compassion, cultural pride, and 
unwavering service enrich our community and inspire us all.
I rise today in honor of Caribbean American 
Heritage Month to recognize a trailblazing leader and advocate from 
Rochester, New York: Norma Thom.
  Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Norma brought to the United States a 
deep commitment to culture, education, and service. After arriving in 
Rochester, she transitioned from her role as a schoolteacher to become 
a prominent voice for the Caribbean American community.
  Norma is a founding member of The Rochester West Indian Festival 
Organization, a nonprofit that has celebrated and promoted Caribbean 
heritage in Rochester for over 42 years. Through her leadership, she 
has fostered unity, cultural pride, and greater visibility for 
Caribbean Americans across our region.
  Beyond her community advocacy, Norma also built a distinguished 
professional career. She spent 29 years at Eastman Kodak Company, where 
she worked in the supply chain and logistics department. She retired in 
2003, leaving behind a legacy of excellence in both her workplace and 
her community.
  It is an honor to recognize Norma Thom during Caribbean American 
Heritage Month. Her enduring legacy continues to uplift Rochester and 
inspire future generations.
I rise today in honor of Caribbean American 
Heritage Month to recognize an extraordinary leader from the Rochester 
community: Roosevelt Mareus.
  As Executive Director and Dean of the Rochester Educational 
Opportunity Center, or REOC, Roosevelt Mareus has led with vision, 
integrity, and a deep commitment to uplifting others. Under his 
leadership, REOC has continued its vital mission of empowering 
individuals, helping countless students break the cycle of poverty and 
reach their utmost potential.
  Born in Haiti, Roosevelts journey is one of remarkable resilience 
and transformation. As a young man overcoming adversity, he found 
direction and opportunity through the very institution he would one day 
lead. Beginning his career at REOC as a security guard, he steadily 
rose through the ranks to become Executive Director. His life story is 
a testament to his perseverance and dedication.
  Roosevelts passion for service extends far beyond Rochester. Deeply 
connected to his Haitian roots, he founded Elevate Haiti Ministries, an 
organization dedicated to building an orphanage and school in Haiti. 
Over the past decade, Elevate Haiti has offered critical education and 
housing for young boys.
  During Caribbean American Heritage Month, it is my great privilege to 
recognize Roosevelt Mareus. His leadership and service continues to 
inspire and uplift communities both here at home and abroad.
I rise today in honor of Caribbean American 
Heritage Month to recognize an exceptional public servant from 
Rochester, New York: Rose Bonnick.
  Born in Jamaica, Rose is a proud member of the Caribbean American 
community and a tireless advocate for equity and opportunity. As a 
Monroe County Legislator and Community Affairs Coordinator for New York 
State Senator Jeremy Cooney, she has dedicated her career to amplifying 
underrepresented voices and advancing policies that create a lasting 
impact. Whether championing local initiatives or supporting statewide 
policy efforts, she brings passion and dedication to every role she 
undertakes.
  Rose is known for her unwavering commitment to uplifting her 
constituents, addressing systemic disparities, and building a stronger, 
more inclusive Rochester. She embodies the very essence of public 
service, leading with empathy and an unshakable belief in the power of 
community.
  Long before she held public office, Rose was deeply embedded in the 
Rochester community through her longstanding work helping Jamaican 
immigrants navigate complex landscapes of services and programs. She 
became affectionately known among family and friends as a ``community 
connector--someone with a unique ability to guide others through the 
hoops and ladders of life. Her knowledge of local systems and her 
natural inclination to serve positioned her as a trusted resource and 
advocate, particularly for new arrivals seeking stability and 
opportunity.
  She consistently creates spaces for engagement, education, and 
empowerment, fostering the next generation of civic leaders. Her vision 
of a more just and equitable society is not just spoken--it is actively 
pursued through her daily work and presence in the community.
  This Caribbean American Heritage Month, it is with deep respect and 
admiration that I recognize Rose Bonnick. Her advocacy continues to 
uplift and enrich our community, leaving a lasting impact for 
generations to come.
