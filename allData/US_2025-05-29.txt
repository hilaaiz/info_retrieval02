I rise today to congratulate the Idlewild 
Elementary School Chess Team champions, and their coach Mark Beatty, on 
their impressive run of successes this year. The 15-member team won the 
2025 Henry D. Sabine State Scholastic Team Chess Tournament in both the 
kindergarten through third grade and kindergarten through fifth grade 
categories. The wins qualified them for a trip to Orlando, Florida, 
earlier this month to compete in the National Elementary Championship 
hosted by the U.S. Chess Federation. Beatty founded the Idlewild team 
in 2013. He also coached chess teams at Grahamwood Elementary, White 
Station Middle School and White Station High School where his teams 
have won 45 state team titles. Idlewood, my elementary school alma 
mater and the only school in Tennessee to receive the Top Magnet School 
of Excellence designation, also sent teams to the national chess 
tournaments in 2024 and 2023. This proud tradition puts Idlewild on a 
short list of the Nations best elementary schools and its students 
deserve our encouragement and respect. They are certainly living up to 
their motto: ``Children First, Excellence Always!
I rise today to celebrate the retirement of 
Darrell S. Tremblay.
  Darrell S. Tremblay first joined the fire service in February of 1987 
as a volunteer fireman in Stafford County, Virginia. From 1991 to 1995, 
he spent time as a professional fireman in the Naval District 
Washington Department of Fire and Emergency Services. Darrell graduated 
from Washington D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department 
Recruit Class 315 on August 8, 1995. His first appointment was to 
Engine 30 before his appointment to Truck 17. On March 30, 2005, 
Darrell Tremblay was appointed to the Marine Division within Special 
Operations.
  During his time on the Fire Boat, Darrell was promoted to Marine 
Operator, Assistant Marine Pilot, and then to Marine Pilot, also 
earning his 200-ton masters license as a Merchant Mariner from the 
United States Coast Guard. Serving the citizens and visitors of the 
district from the water was Darrells passion. His time spent working 
on the Fire Boat included maintaining the departments fireboat fleet, 
training with municipalities around the region to hone his skill set, 
and performing countless rescue operations.
  In the 20 years served on the Fire Boat, Darrell has earned 
commendations to include a Class II Unit Citation for Valor, Armed 
Forces Expeditionary Ribbon, the Coast Guard Meritorious Team 
Commendation, and many others. After 30 years in the DCFD, and a 
commendable service record, Darrell Tremblay is retiring on July 12, 
2025.
, I ask that you join me in recognizing Darrell S. 
Tremblay for his service to the Nation. I am proud to join him in 
celebrating this remarkable achievement. May the Lord bless him as he 
embarks on his next challenge, and I look forward to seeing his 
continued success in the future.
I rise today to honor the 
life of Hattie Mae Love Pettway Inge and her service to our community. 
28, 2025, at the 
age of 90.
  Hattie Inge was born on June 22, 1934, in Vredenburgh, Alabama, and 
she was raised in Mobile, Alabama. Following her graduation from 
Alabama State University, she pursued a career in nursing, earning her 
diploma from Dixie Hospitals Nursing School in Hampton, Virginia in 
1962.
  In 1952, Hattie married Roy Inge, and together they raised six 
children. Their family embarked on numerous journeys as a military 
family--their destinations included Europe, Asia, and nearly every U.S. 
state.
  While stationed in Tachikawa, Japan, Mrs. Inge furthered her 
education with a degree from the University of Maryland. Later in her 
life, she earned additional degrees and certifications from 
institutions including Riverside City College, Anthony Real Estate 
School, and the Redlands Regional Occupational Program in Commercial 
Floristry.
  In 1972, Mrs. Inge settled in Rialto, California, where she quickly 
immersed herself in civic engagement. As a member of both The Rialto 
Baptist Church and later, the Loveland Church in Fontana, Mrs. Inge co-
founded the Rialto Black History Committee in 1985. This organization 
became a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in 1986, with its mission set to promote 
cultural awareness and celebrate African American contributions in 
Rialto.
  Under Hatties leadership, the Rialto Black History Committee 
organized the Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Luncheon for 35 
consecutive years. This event provided seven to ten scholarships each 
year to students in the community, advancing educational opportunities 
and honoring Dr. Kings legacy of service and justice.
  For over 30 years, Mrs. Inge was an active member of Eta Phi Beta 
Sorority, Incorporated. She held various leadership roles, including 
Chapter President, Soror of the Year, Assistant Western Regional 
Director, and Western Regional Director.
a lasting impact throughout our state through her 
involvement in numerous organizations. She was a member of the Military 
Wives Club, Protestant Women of the Chapel, Girl Scouts of the USA, Boy 
Scouts of America, and Tachikawa Air Base Youth Program. Hattie also 
served as a Tour Chairperson and Family Services Volunteer.
  Even in retirement, she continued her mission of helping others. 
Through the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, she taught classes

on fall prevention and scam awareness, caring for other vulnerable 
members of her community.
  For her outstanding accomplishments and remarkable life, it is my 
honor to recognize Mrs. Hattie May Love Pettway Inge. Her service and 
commitment to California and our Nation are worthy of the highest 
commendation.
I rise today in solemn remembrance 
of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky, two young Israeli Embassy 
employees who were tragically murdered outside the Capital Jewish 
Museum in Washington, D.C., in a heinous act of antisemitic violence.
  Shot at close range by an assailant from Chicago, they were targeted 
simply for who they were. As they lay on the ground, the assailant 
fired again, continuing to pursue Ms. Milgrim as she tried to crawl 
away. He then entered the museum, posed as a witness, and

ultimately confessed, stating he carried out the attack ``for Gaza 
and ``for Palestine.
  Sarah was a peace-seeking public servant who dedicated her career to 
fostering dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. Yaron was a warm, 
idealistic young man preparing for a life in diplomacy. The two had 
planned to become engaged on an upcoming trip to Israel. Their futures 
were full of promise. Their loss is immeasurable.
  This attack is not an isolated act; it reflects a broader trend of 
increasing antisemitism at home and abroad. According to the Anti-
Defamation League, antisemitic incidents have risen by 140 percent in 
the months following the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.
  Antisemitism has no place in this country.
  May the memories of Sarah and Yaron be a blessing. Let us honor them 
not only with remembrance, but with resolve to confront hatred wherever 
it appears.
I thank my colleague and good friend, the 
Ranking Member of the Rules Committee Jim McGovern. He is a tireless 
fighter for working families and I am proud to be in that fight with 
him. I am glad to call out the egregious giveaway to billionaires and 
big corporations being orchestrated in this Republican tax bill.
  The $4.5 trillion--and counting, counting because we do not have the 
full CBO score as this bill is being jammed through the House--is what 
we are talking about. That is what Republicans are preparing to shower 
on the richest companies and their billionaire owners, while giving 
mere pennies to the middle class, working class, and vulnerable 
families who are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis.
  President Trump campaigned on lowering prices. He pledged to ``bring 
food costs down on day one. Instead, the opposite has happened. His 
own USDA recently reported egg prices could rise 41 percent over the 
next year. Since taking office, he has done nothing to help families.
  This is shameful, because the alternative is clear. A few weeks ago, 
I reintroduced the American Family Act, legislation to reinstate the 
improved, expanded Child Tax Credit. The American Family Act would 
create the strongest version of the tax credit ever, indexing the value 
of the credit to inflation, and it would establish a baby bonus to help 
families in that critical first year after birth.
  The data proves that the expanded Child Tax Credit that we passed in 
2021 delivered the greatest middle class tax cut in a generation, 
reaching nearly 36 million families--61 million children. It was the 
antidote to child poverty and to inflation. It gave real money back to 
millions of working families in the form of monthly checks, cutting 
child hunger by a fourth and bringing child poverty down to the lowest 
recorded levels in history.
  The watered-down imitation of a Child Tax Credit included in this 
bill will not continue this progress. I want to take this time to 
address a few misconceptions about the Child Tax Credit that have been 
present in this debate so far. According to the Columbia Center on 
Poverty and Social Policy, nearly one out of four children, 17 million 
children nationwide, are excluded from full credit because their family 
incomes are too low to qualify. This is not an issue of work 
requirements. The current version of the CTC functions as an income 
requirement, hurting families who work hard or are retired grandparents 
who are now caring for a second generation, but simply do not earn 
enough to qualify. Families with parents who work hard will be excluded 
because their wages are too meager. Are you truly saying that 
billionaires and corporations need tax breaks more than the youngest of 
your constituents? This bill would make that problem worse, not better.
  This bill pays lip service to the Child Tax Credit--I believe the 
American people need more than that.
  Our bill is the real deal. The improved, expanded Child Tax Credit 
fixes this problem. We need that now more than ever. Across the 
country, families are living paycheck to paycheck while prices for 
everyday goods and essential services, from eggs to gasoline to 
medicine and childcare, continue to rise.
  This should not be a partisan issue. Republicans like former Senator 
Mitt Romney, Senator Josh Hawley, and even Vice President J.D. Vance 
have supported the Child Tax Credit because the evidence that it helped 
families is so overwhelming.
  But Republican leadership in Congress has been clear: they want to 
give the corporate lobbyists everything they ask for and then some. 
They are gutting Medicaid, food stamps, and anything else that stands 
in the way of more money for billionaires.
  This bill is not responding to the cost-of-living crisis. This bill 
is pouring gasoline on the fire. My promise to American families is 
that I will fight as hard as I can, with every ally I can find, to stop 
this corrupt giveaway and focus on bringing down the cost of living 
through a proven policy, the expanded Child Tax Credit--not the meager 
substitute in this bill.
I rise today to honor a true legend in the 
Michigan veteran community. It is with deep respect and heartfelt 
appreciation that I get to recognize Commander Leonard Huyck for 
extraordinary service and steadfast leadership of VFW Post 8964.
  Since being elected Post Commander in May of 1983, Leonard has 
dedicated forty-two years of his life to leading his fellow veterans, 
honoring their service, and strengthening the bonds of community and 
patriotism that define the VFW. His leadership has not only guided Post 
8964 through decades of change, but ensured it remained a place of 
honor, support, and purpose for all who served.
  Forty-two years is more than a milestone, its a testament to 
Leonards character, commitment, and love of country. He has given his 
time, energy, and heart to this mission, building a legacy that will 
outlast all of us in the process.
  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I thank Commander Huyck for his 
service. He has made a difference in the lives of many, and our 
community is a better place because of him.
, I ask my colleagues to join me and the people of our 
mid-Michigan community in recognizing Commander Huyck for his decades 
of service.
I rise today to recognize 
Dorothy Draper &amp; Company on 100 years of business.
  Founded in 1925, it is the oldest continually operating interior 
design firm in America. Its founder and namesake, Dorothy Draper, was a 
trailblazer, starting her company at a time when most women did not 
seek employment. Her vision, love of color, chintz, and tendency 
towards the dramatic solidified her iconic style dubbed ``the Draper 
Touch. Her protege, Carleton Varney, championed her work throughout 
his career, and the company flourished under his leadership, the 
creative genius and driving force who led the firm for 60 years. Mr. 
Varney went on to decorate the West Virginia Governors mansion in the 
1980s, further solidifying ``the Draper Touch into the states 
culture and history.
  The Dorothy Draper Companys work is especially important to my home 
state of West Virginia, where their most famous design is showcased, 
The Greenbrier Resort, affectionately called ``Americas Resort. 
Located in White Sulphur Springs, the Greenbriers legacy took a unique 
turn when it was converted into a military hospital to meet the demands 
brought about during WWII. It was then returned to a hotel and 
transformed into the unique and bold getaway we recognize today.
  The Greenbrier has hosted presidents, royalty, celebrities, and 
countless West Virginians and Americans since 1778. Dorothys use of 
color and pattern was so distinctly `her that her legacy lives on in 
her company and through those that she inspired.
  I am so delighted and proud to recognize co-owner Sebastian Varney 
and Design Director Rudy Saunders, and their company. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating them on a century of success 
and wish them many more to come.
I rise today to recognize the achievements of 
Ed Donnella, originally from Springfield, Massachusetts, who recently 
was honored by the Organization of American Historians (OAH) as the 
winner of the prestigious 2025 Mary K. Bonstell Teacher of the Year 
Award. He currently is a U.S. History and Government teacher at Gonzaga 
High School in Washington, D.C.
  The award was given at the OAH annual meeting last April in Chicago 
and was presented by Pulitzer Prize winning author and historian David 
Blight. The citation reads in part: ``Mr. Donnellan has worked 
diligently to expand the teaching of history regarding slavery and 
social justice issues. He created pioneering student-led research in 
the role of Gonzaga College High Schools history with slavery, leading 
seminars and presentations over this material at both local and 
national venues.
  Ed Donnellan grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts and graduated from 
the University of Massachusetts and Springfield College where he 
studied history. He has been teaching high school for thirty-nine 
years. Teaching the history of slavery took on greater meaning when Ed 
led a group of Gonzaga students on a three-year journey to research 
Gonzagas historical ties with slavery. Working at the Georgetown 
University archives, the students read 19th century financial records 
that showed the school was built with profits from Jesuit run slave 
plantation in Southern Maryland. The students also identified five 
enslaved persons who worked at the school. Reckoning with this history 
has been challenging and continues to this day.
  As a teacher for over forty years, including U.S. History, I 
understand the complex issue of teaching ``difficult histories. It is 
vital that students get a full picture of the American experience; 
history that we are proud of and history that is hard to hear. Learning 
the challenging parts of our history ensures that future generations 
can learn from mistakes of the previous. That is why it is important to 
recognize educators like Ed Donnellan and encourage others to follow in 
his footsteps.
, please join me in honoring Ed Donnellan and wish him 
continued success in educating students on Americas past.
I rise today to recognize First 
Lady Elizabeth Mobley of Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church. A woman 
whose spiritual influence can be seen and heard throughout Western New 
York through children of all ages and parishioners beyond the walls of 
church on Sunday.
  First Lady Mobley studied at SUNY Fredonia, earning a Masters Degree 
in Speech Pathology. From there, she began her career in the Buffalo 
Public School system, identifying the proper communication skills of 
students by working with educators and families to ensure students 
success.
  First Lady Mobley is committed to prioritizing the needs of her 
students and parishioners, serving as the leader of the Senior and 
Youth Ministry at Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church, while remaining 
an active participant in the choir and Womens Ministry. Bound by love 
and strengthened by prayer, she credits the work that she does to the 
unwavering support of her family, Pastor Keith

Mobley, and their four blessed children: Tyson, Talia, Tevin, and Troy.
  Today, as we recognize the incredible service of First Lady Elizabeth 
Mobley, let us not only acknowledge her dedicated career as a Speech 
Pathologist and her steadfast commitment to children in need, but her 
dedication to ministry at Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church, 
providing a safe space for all to be heard. First Lady Mobley service 
is a blessing, and we look forward to many more years of her inspired 
leadership.
I rise today in recognition of Patricia Ann 
Millers outstanding service as a Surviving Spouse Liaison at the 
Military Officers Association of America. Pat has approached her work 
as a liaison with immense passion and commitment, exemplifying the 
virtues of service to her community and Nation.
  Pat has continuously shown the highest standard of care to veterans 
surviving spouses, advocating for legislation that supports them, 
helping them access healthcare benefits, and reaching out on a routine 
basis to encourage them in their daily life. Pat has represented the 
MOAA on numerous occasions and spearheaded events to honor surviving 
spouses. In one case, Pat established a memorial fund that donated to 
family charities identified by each surviving spouse in memory of their 
loved one.
  Pat showcases exceptional personal care for the people she helps, 
immediately contacting newly surviving spouses to support them in their 
time of grief and inform them of available resources. Every holiday, 
Pat contacts each surviving spouse personally with well-wishes and 
comfort.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshires First Congressional 
District, I thank Pat for her thoughtfulness and dedication to the 
surviving spouses she has supported. Granite staters are grateful that 
the spouses of our brave veterans may receive attentive care from 
professionals like Pat, and I wish her only the best in the years to 
come.
I along with my colleagues, 
Representative Wasserman Schultz and Representative Cherfilus-McCormick 
rise today to highlight and celebrate the 2025 Honorees of the Senior 
Hall of Fame, an esteemed tradition made possible through the tireless 
efforts of the Area Agency on Aging of Broward County, a cornerstone 
organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for older 
adults in our community.

I, along with members of the Ohio Delegation, 
would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Major General John 
C. Harris, Jr., on his retirement as Adjutant General of the Ohio 
National Guard. During General Harriss career in the Ohio National 
Guard, he held a wide range of leadership positions, culminating in 
service as a key member of Governor DeWines cabinet. Governor DeWine 
announced General Harriss retirement and nomination to be the next 
director of the Ohio Department of Veterans Affairs.
  General Harris began his military career in 1981 when he enlisted in 
the Ohio Army National Guard. He was assigned to the 107th Armored 
Cavalry Regiment located in Worthington, Ohio where he was part of 
their Attack Helicopter Troop. Through Officer Candidate School, he 
received his commission in 1984 and became the section leader for the

succeed General Mark Bartman as Ohio Adjutant General. On January 14, 
2019, Major General Harris was sworn in as the 83rd Adjutant General of 
the Ohio National Guard. Since then, General Harris has been a 
steadfast and capable leader of the Ohio National Guard. He has been 
instrumental in the creation of the Ohio Cyber Reserve as well as the 
conversion of the Mansfield Air National Guard Wing to the 179th 
Cyberspace Wing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, his strong leadership 
allowed the National Guard to respond across the state and assist 
hospitals and Ohioans in need.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute 
to Major General John Harris, on his retirement from the Ohio National 
Guard. On behalf of the citizens of Ohio, I wish General Harris all the 
best as he assumes his new position as Director of the Ohio Department 
of Veterans Affairs. I along with the entire Ohio Delegation thank him 
for his forty-four years of service to Ohio and our Nation.
-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
importance of the Orphan Drug Act in driving rare disease therapy 
clinical research in my district at the University

of Iowa. As a physician, a legislator, and a member of the Rare Disease 
Congressional Caucus, I have seen firsthand the life-changing impact 
that medical innovation can have on patients battling rare diseases. 
Iowas first congressional district is home to clinical trials for 
several rare diseases that lack a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved therapy, including Becker muscular dystrophy, Gaucher disease 
type 3, and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. For these patients, and the 
millions of Americans suffering from rare diseases, scientific 
advancements represent more than just medical progress--they offer hope 
where none previously existed.
  That hope would not be possible without the Orphan Drug Act, which 
has served as the foundation for rare disease drug development for over 
four decades. The Orphan Drug Acts most critical incentive is orphan 
drug exclusivity, which is a seven-year period of market exclusivity. 
This incentive ensures that innovators willing to take the 
extraordinary risk of developing a first-in-class treatment for a 
complex condition affecting a small patient population are 
appropriately rewarded.
  For many rare diseases, the first FDA-approved treatment is a 
lifeline. These therapies often require years of research, billions in 
investment, and considerable perseverance to bring these medicines to 
patients. Without a strong and reliable exclusivity framework, these 
treatments simply would not exist. Congress intended orphan exclusivity 
to serve as ``a marketplace-oriented solution that provide incentives 
for private enterprise to develop orphan drugs. FDA established 
regulations that aimed to protect this critical economic incentive 
while also encouraging continued innovation for a rare disease by 
allowing a follow-on product that is the same drug for the same use to 
break orphan exclusivity if it demonstrates greater efficacy, greater 
safety, or a ``major contribution to patient care relative to the 
original orphan drug. Congress codified these regulations in 2017.
  Congress has long recognized that the ``major contribution care 
prong of the ``clinical superiority standard is meant to be a high 
bar. We did not intend for minor modifications such as changes in 
dosing frequency or formulation to erode the exclusivity protections of 
the first innovator drug unless such modifications result in a 
significant clinical benefit in treating the underlying conditions. If 
we allow marginal improvements rather than true clinical advancements 
to justify breaking orphan exclusivity, we undermine the very incentive 
that encourages companies to develop first-in-class therapies in the 
first place. The FDA has a clear precedent for maintaining a high bar 
for clinical superiority determinations. If we lower the bar for 
breaking orphan exclusivity, especially for ``major contribution to 
patient care, we will undermine the future of rare disease drug 
development.
  Lowering the bar will deter investment in first-in-class therapies by 
reducing the certainty that companies will be able to benefit from the 
exclusivity protections Congress intended. Lowering the bar will create 
regulatory uncertainty, leading to litigation, market instability, and 
hesitation from investors who fund rare disease innovation. Lowering 
the bar will set a dangerous precedent for copycat products with few 
modifications, encouraging incremental changes rather than bold 
scientific advancements. Lowering the bar will hurt patients most of 
all, delaying or discouraging the development of a first-ever therapy 
for the nearly 10,000 rare diseases that still lack an FDA-approved 
treatment.
  As a physician, I know that true medical breakthroughs require bold 
investment, sustained commitment, and regulatory certainty. As a 
legislator, I am committed to preserving the integrity of the Orphan 
Drug Act and ensuring that it continues to drive life-changing 
treatments for patients. FDA must apply the law a Congress intended and 
not allow minor modifications to erode exclusivity protections that 
serve as the foundation for rare disease innovation. Today, I am 
calling on my fellow members of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus 
to stand together to protect the value of the incentives established in 
the Orphan Drug Act.
