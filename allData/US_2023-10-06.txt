                    HONORING CELEBRA GRAPEVINE 2023

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETH VAN DUYNE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
2nd Annual Celebra Grapevine festival which will take place on October 
7th in Grapevine, Texas and is dedicated to celebrating Hispanic 
Heritage Month.
  In 1988, President Ronald Reagan established Hispanic Heritage Month 
to celebrate the histories, cultures, and contributions made by 
Americans of Hispanic descent. Consistent with this fine tradition, 
Celebra Grapevine provides North Texans with an opportunity to embrace 
diversity and honor the Hispanic heritage that has influenced 
traditions, art, and cuisine throughout our community. Celebra means to 
celebrate in Spanish, which is a fitting name for this festival. 
Grapevine&#x27;s Latino population, which makes up more than 30 percent of 
the city&#x27;s population, plays an important role in growing the city&#x27;s 
economy and making the city a great place to live, work, and raise a 
family.
  I commend the City of Grapevine and Celebra Grapevine for their 
commitment to fostering unity and building bridges in our community. I 
hope their festival is a great success.

                          ____________________

                 HONORING CHIEF OF STAFF ELLIOTT GUFFIN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RICHARD HUDSON

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the public 
service of a long-time member of my team, George Elliott Guffin IV, and 
wish him success as he enters the next stage of his career.
  A native of Jackson, Mississippi, Elliott is a proud graduate of the 
University of Mississippi--a fact he will share with you within five 
minutes of meeting him. Elliott began his congressional service in the 
United States Senate in the office of Senator Roger Wicker prior to 
joining my staff in May 2016 and beginning a long tenure of service to 
the people of North Carolina&#x27;s 8th, and later 9th, Congressional 
District.
  As a young staff assistant, Elliott excelled at many things. His 
sunny disposition, eagerness to learn, and dedication to public service 
are the main reasons why I didn&#x27;t fire him that time he forgot and 
stranded a scheduled tour group at the White House. However, my faith 
in Elliott was rewarded as he grew to be a trusted advisor, mentor to 
others, an exceptional leader, and a valued part of the team.
  Advancing as a legislative correspondent, legislative aide, 
legislative assistant, senior legislative assistant, legislative 
director, deputy chief of staff, and chief of staff, Elliott never 
wavered in his commitment to serving our constituents. Over the years, 
he helped me secure legislation to push for the paving of roads for the 
Green Gap community in the Uwharrie National Forest--a process that 
will soon come to fruition. In addition, Elliott helped me secure 
multiple pieces of legislation to address the needs of our farmers, 
expand rural broadband access for North Carolinians, and increase 
support for our region&#x27;s troops, military families, and veterans.
  I am especially proud of the work Elliott accomplished in defense of 
the Second Amendment, drafting legislation with me to harden and secure 
schools and pushing for concealed carry reciprocity.
  Over the years, Elliott has established himself as a trusted leader 
and friend to his colleagues. He was the backbone of our office--always 
willing to do whatever was needed to help the team. I have been 
impressed by the attention Elliott gave to his managerial role by 
setting aside time to work with each member of our staff in order to 
help them develop into great congressional staffers. Through his 
dedicated leadership, Elliott has taken what has always been a great 
team and built an exceptional one by understanding the values and 
motivations of his peers.
  Of all his tremendous achievements for North Carolina and the 
country, I am most proud of the man I&#x27;ve had the privilege to watch him 
grow into. I always tell my staff that over all things, family is 
first. Elliott has taken this to heart since day one, even ensuring I 
made it to my son&#x27;s soccer game as we drove from the opposite end of 
North Carolina. I&#x27;ve been able to see the same values watching him get 
married and start his own family, starting with his lovely wife, Ariel, 
and their beloved dog, Moose.
  Elliott Guffin made a difference. He made a difference to me and to 
his colleagues. He made a difference in the lives of my constituents. 
He made a difference to this institution. And he made a difference to 
the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, please join me today in congratulating 
Elliott Guffin for more than seven years of incredible service to the 
House of Representatives and to the people of North Carolina, and 
wishing he, Ariel, and Moose the best in their future endeavors.

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
contributions of Adjoa McDonald as she is honored as one of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year.
  Adjoa has dedicated her career to advocating for women and youth in 
the city of Vallejo.
  Adjoa founded the Vallejo Project, an organization dedicated to 
developing the leadership skills of youth and young adults so they can 
improve the systems that impact them. Adjoa&#x27;s work has created a 
platform that empowers and uplifts women and youth in Vallejo, 
providing them with a network to connect, learn, and support each 
other.
  Beyond advocating for women individually, Adjoa also fights to 
improve the status of women throughout society. She fights to address 
issues that impact all women, such as gender inequality, domestic 
violence, and economic disempowerment.
  Adjoa cares deeply about working collaboratively to make broad 
change. She knows the importance of her work because she has faced the 
obstacles that many women in Vallejo, and the United States, experience 
today. She is an example of the strength and resilience that women 
possess and use those qualities to make a difference for the women in 
her community.
  On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, 
it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Adjoa McDonald for her 
positive contributions to our community.

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
contributions of Alice Wilson-Fried as she is honored as one of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year.
  Alice is dedicated to teaching the youth of Solano County about the 
importance of democracy and civic engagement. Seeing the need to 
educate young people about voting rights and civic duty, Alice 
implemented the Democracy Matters program at Golden Hills Community 
School. This curriculum gives students the opportunity to learn about 
the importance of democracy and its impact, allowing students to see 
themselves as leaders with a voice in the policy process.
  The importance and impact of this program has been recognized by the 
California Secretary of State, who is in discussions to use it in their 
statewide youth outreach efforts. Through the framework of Democracy 
Matters, Alice has given students hands-on experiences with civic 
engagement, including coordinating a mock City Council meeting in the

[[Page E940]]

Suisun City council chambers and training students on how to conduct a 
forum with Solano Youth Council. She also worked with the Solano County 
Registrar of Voters and League of Women Voters to train students who 
volunteered as poll workers. These hands-on opportunities have allowed 
students to learn about the importance of citizenship and the power of 
their voices in our democracy.
  Alice&#x27;s work to educate the next generation about democracy will have 
an impact for years to come. On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 
8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize 
Alice Wilson-Fried for her positive contributions to our community.

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
contributions of Alissa Stolz as she is honored as one of California&#x27;s 
8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year.
  Alissa is the Head of School at East Bay Montessori where she has 
demonstrated outstanding school leadership throughout the COVID-19 
pandemic and its aftermath.
  The pandemic impacted schools in previously unimaginable ways, and 
school leaders were called upon to hold their communities together. 
Alissa was instrumental in keeping East Bay Montessori intact 
throughout the pandemic, avoiding any COVID-19 outbreaks and never 
having to lay off any staff or faculty.
  Alissa was committed to in-person learning, and East Bay Montessori 
quickly reopened with an outdoor classroom set-up that let students and 
teachers come together and learn in innovative ways. This decision 
allowed children to continue to learn through peer collaboration and 
face-to-face interactions.
  Alissa provided a strong vision for East Bay Montessori during times 
of uncertainty and change. Her work led her to be featured in the 
American Montessori Society&#x27;s magazine, and she was selected to present 
at the International Montessori Congress in Bangkok. The impact of 
Alissa&#x27;s work goes beyond East Bay Montessori--she is the model of a 
capable leader who acts in the interest of her community, inspiring 
educators across the globe.

  On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, 
it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Alissa Stolz for her positive 
contributions to our community.

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
contributions of Barbara Brewer as she is honored as one of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year.
  Barbara retired from the United States Air Force after 20 years but 
continued her service as a civilian employee and is now a Unit Program 
Coordinator in the 21st Airlift Squadron at Travis Air Force Base. In 
addition to her official duties in this role, Barbara selflessly 
volunteers for more responsibilities, including Security Program 
Manager, Paying Agent, and Resource Advisor. She has been essential to 
the squadron&#x27;s success and is fondly referred to as ``Squadron Mom.&#x27;&#x27;
  Barbara is the liaison between the aircrew, government travel 
agencies and foreign embassies, ensuring rapid travel in support of 
USTRANSCOM operations. Her actions have directly contributed to the 
success of over 5,000 flight hours, 1,300 sorties, and 7 million pounds 
of cargo successfully delivered to meet our Nation&#x27;s priorities. Every 
member of her squadron knows they can rely on Barbara regardless of 
time or day or the reason for the call, because she shows unfailing 
care for every servicemember.
  Barbara was chosen as an Assistant Mission Commander for the Capstone 
Military Leadership Program where she manages the development of over 
50 Generals and Flag Officers. On one mission she was asked to speak 
about her experiences as a woman in the military with the women of the 
Zambian Air Force, a country where women were historically excluded 
from service.
  Barbara&#x27;s 35 years of service to our country have led to a profound 
impact on her squadron. Travis AFB, and beyond.
  On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, 
it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Barbara Brewer for her

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
contributions of Betty Reid Soskin as she is honored as one of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year.
  Betty is widely known for being the National Park Service&#x27;s oldest 
park ranger who retired at the age of 100. She has lived in the East 
Bay since 1927, when her family moved from New Orleans.
  As a young woman during World War II, Betty worked as a shipyard 
clerk for an all-Black auxiliary lodge of the segregated Boilermaker&#x27;s 
union. In 1945 she and her husband founded one of the first Black-owned 
music stores, which remained open until 2019. Over the years she has 
worked as staff to a Berkeley city council member, a state 
Assemblywoman, and a California State Senator.
  In the early 2000s, Betty became involved in the plans to open the 
Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park. This led to 
her career as a ranger which began in 2007, at the age of 85.
  Betty led talks explaining the importance of the park in 
memorializing the contributions of women and African Americans working 
in war industries supporting the U.S. World War II efforts on the home 
front. She has used her own experiences and observations as a Black 
woman to bring light to untold stories of African Americans during WWII 
and underscore the racism and misogyny experienced by her and countless 
other women of color throughout her lifetime. Through hard work and 
storytelling, she has touched the lives of the thousands of park 
visitors and millions of Americans who can not only empathize with her 
story but celebrate and learn from it.
  On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, 
it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Betty Reid Soskin for her 
positive contributions to our community.

contributions of Brenda Plechaty as she is a honored as one of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year.
  Brenda&#x27;s life was changed when her partner had a serious accident 
resulting in a traumatic brain injury. During his recovery, Brenda 
experienced the lack of support there is for the family members of 
those who have traumatic brain injuries. This led Brenda to create, 
run, and fully fund a free support group for family members who are 
caregivers to TBI survivors.
  Brenda is dedicated to this group and helping the caregivers of TBI 
survivors, making herself available to caregivers every day, not just 
during the group&#x27;s monthly meetings. Brenda&#x27;s work for this group has 
led her to become fully immersed in the TBI community, willing to share 
information and provide support whenever possible to those who have 
been impacted by TBI.
  In addition to her work supporting caregivers, Brenda serves on 
several commissions and committees in the city of Vallejo and is 
actively working with the city to improve the Vallejo Municipal Marina. 
A passionate rower, Brenda is involved in her rowing club&#x27;s 
volunteering division and helped to create a summer youth rowing 
project that included instruction on the importance of the marina.
  All facets of Brenda&#x27;s work show her compassion and dedication to 
serving others.
  On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, 
it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Brenda Plechaty for her 
positive contributions to our community.

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to introduce the 
Medicaid Accountability Act of 2023. My legislation would remove 
barriers to operating Medicaid Fraud Control Units in the territories, 
advancing our ability to recover taxpayer money through the 
investigation of Medicaid provider fraud, abuse, and neglect.
  The U.S. territories are subject to a hard, statutory cap on federal 
Medicaid support, unlike the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As 
such, any spending for the operation of an MFCU is counted against the 
cap and subtracts from the amount of federal funding available for the 
coverage of healthcare services.
  Congress has acknowledged this challenge. We acted to exempt MFCU 
spending from Puerto Rico&#x27;s cap through P.L. 115-31, Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2017. This exemption was extended to the U.S. 
Virgin Islands through P.L. 115-123, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. We 
did not, however, extend this exemption to the other territories 
although all territories are statutorily required to operate an MFCU.
  Congress has previously agreed that spending towards systems 
improvement measures should be exempt from the cap. In addition to 
MFCUs, Congress has exempted spending related to Transformed Medicaid 
Statistical Information System, Medicaid Electronic Health Record 
Incentive Program, and the design and operation of the claims and 
eligibility systems.
  Without such exemptions, territories must choose between covering 
healthcare services or making systems improvements. And faced with 
various emergencies--from natural disasters to a pandemic--in recent 
years, territories have prioritized the coverage of healthcare 
services. Furthermore, certain territories have repeatedly exhausted 
their limited block grant, leaving no federal funding to support 
systems improvement measures.
  My bill, the Medicaid Accountability Act of 2023, plugs a gap in our 
nation&#x27;s ability to protect taxpayer money. By extending the exemption 
on MFCU spending to all territories, Congress can promote the success 
of the territories in meeting statutory obligations to combat 
healthcare fraud and safeguard our Medicaid population from abuse, 
neglect, and misappropriation of funds.
  I thank my colleagues who joined me in introducing this legislation--
Mr. Moylan, Ms. Plaskett, and Ms. Radewagen.

                    RECOGNIZING KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
musical achievements of Kenny Wayne Shepherd.
  Kenny received his first guitar from his grandmother at the age of 
four and began to play the guitar in earnest at age seven. It is here 
when he began his love of the American genre of blues. With a 
Stratocaster electric guitar replica, he taught himself to play one 
note at a time. Growing up in Shreveport, Louisiana, he was exposed to 
music that influenced his relentless pursuit of his guitar skills and 
love of this art form. From Elvis to Ledbelly, the combination of 
country, blues, and rock which flowed through his hometown created the 
musician we hear today. His parents brought all varieties of music into 
his home, which deepened his appreciation for the talents and stylings 
of other artists. From Hank Williams, James Brown, and Crosby Stills 
Nash and Young to Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King, these artists 
were the foundation of the musical talents we all enjoy today from 
Kenny Wayne.
  At a very young age, Kenny&#x27;s father brought John Lee Hooker and Muddy 
Waters to Shreveport to p]ay. This was the moment that turned on the 
light of blues music in Kenny Wayne&#x27;s life. Kenny&#x27;s father, Ken, 
remembers his son playing his electric guitar with headphones on 
listening to CDs of John Lee Hooker, B.B King and Howling Wolf. Kenny 
was able to pick up by ear the unique aspects of American blues music. 
Stevie Ray Vaughan asked a young Kenny Wayne if he would like to watch 
from the side of the stage during his concert and on that night the 
impact of this incredible guitar virtuoso was ingrained in a 7-year-old 
aspiring musician.
  Chris Layton, who played drums in Stevie Ray&#x27;s band, Double Trouble, 
later became the drummer for the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band. He 
remembers the exceptional talents of Kenny when he heard some of his 
earliest recordings. Chris was deeply impressed by Kenny&#x27;s 
determination, focus and dedication to his craft.
  Kenny had the opportunity to travel with his father to many different 
music venues, where he played to a variety of audiences. Many folks 
began to point out the remarkable talent that he displayed. Bill 
Pfordresher, a record producer, told Kenny&#x27;s father that they should 
cut a record. Ken Shepherd had three rules for Kenny. First, that he 
must finish high school before he would allow him to pursue music full 
time. Ken&#x27;s second rule was once music was no longer fun for Kenny he 
could stop at any time. The final rule was Kenny had to be involved in 
every business decision that was made about his career. They, then 
called in some favors from friends and recorded a record in New Orleans 
which quickly took off. Kenny now found himself as the opening act for 
the Eagles.
  Kenny&#x27;s circumstances in his career success were unique. He and his 
dad were a father-son team and Kenny was not the lead singer in the 
early days of his band. Kenny was able to overcome these challenges and 
continue on an upward path of success, while maintaining a strong 
relationship with his father. Kenny Wayne became a remarkable 
songwriter who has honed his guitar skills around amazing songs. His 
songwriting chops and collaborations are as good as it gets.
  Kenny Wayne&#x27;s talents were a magnet to very accomplished songwriting 
collaborators. Record Executive Jeff Aldrich surrounded Kenny Wayne 
with a crack team of collaborators including Mark Selby, Tia Sillers 
and Danny Tate. They were welcomed like family as the songs on the 
albums Ledbetter Heights and Trouble is . . . were written and 
recorded, and helped him reach his true potential as a musician. The 
emotional power of Kenny&#x27;s songwriting is probably no stronger than in 
the song ``I Found Love.&#x27;&#x27;
  Kenny has been a leader in involving women in his path to success, 
from Tia Sillers as a leading songwriter to Kristin Forbes in leading 
Team Kenny Wayne Shepherd. His co-manager for over 20 years, Kristin 
Forbes has played an incredibly vital role in Kenny Wayne&#x27;s career. She 
has known Kenny since she worked at his record company early in his 
career. Kristin and Kenny&#x27;s father have directed the team that has laid 
down the path of success. She is a highly skilled leader and a 
thoughtful voice of balance for Kenny, Ken and the band.
  Kenny is a trailblazer, who, along with a cadre of incredible 
accompanying musicians, amazing songwriters, and the perfect mix of 
vocals, is an icon in American music. Kenny continues to expand his 
musical horizons and skills, including his own vocals.
  As important as Kenny&#x27;s musical talents is his complete dedication to 
his wife, Hannah, and his six beloved children. He is a remarkable 
father and role model for his family. He and his wife have made it 
their life&#x27;s work to ensure limitless possibilities for their children 
by nurturing their interests, talents, and abilities in every 
imaginable way. Kenny is selflessly humble and appreciative of all 
those around him who have been a part of his path to success. He is 
ceaseless with giving credit to his parents, his hometown, his 
upbringing, and friends and family in helping him along the way.
  Our nation is grateful for Kenny&#x27;s passion, commitment to his musical 
skills and his love of family and his fellow musicians in his continued 
journey to share his talents with folks here and around the world. 
American blues is a unique genre of music that captures the soul of our 
country, and Kenny is a rare, and irreplaceable part of that emotion. 
He is the quintessential artist and creator. I thank Kenny Wayne 
Shepherd, for music that has and will continue to inspire generations 
to come, for his devotion to family, fellow artists, associates and 
friends, and for his goodness and kindheartedness. May God continue to 
continue to bless him and his family, team and bandmates.

      RECOGNIZING PENELOPE GROSS ON THE OCCASION OF HER RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to congratulate 
Penelope ``Penny&#x27;&#x27; Gross on her retirement after 27 years of serving as 
the Fairfax County Mason District Supervisor and 21 years of chairing 
the Potomac Watershed Roundtable.
  Elected in 1995 to represent the Mason District, Penny has been an 
advocate for affordable housing, expanded public transportation, and 
violence prevention. Penny represents Fairfax County on the Board of 
Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the 
Northern Virginia Regional Commission, the INOVA Health System Board of 
Trustees, and the Potomac Watershed Roundtable (PWR).
  Shortly after becoming the chair of PWR, she encouraged the VA 
Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) to help in developing 
strategies that will bring the state of Virginia up to the standard 
that Maryland had already set, regarding efforts that support the 
Chesapeake Bay Preservation Program. With that, in July 2003, the 
Potomac River Tributary Strategy was developed by DCR.
  In January 2004, Penny led the PWR in discussions for a 2004 vision, 
whose focal points influenced many water-related issues, such as 
Stormwater Management, Wastewater Treatment Plants, and Total Maximum 
Daily Load. In April later that year Penny was appointed by then 
Governor Mark Warner to the Chesapeake Bay Blue Ribbon Funding Panel. A 
panel tasked with finding alternative sources for funding the 
Chesapeake Bay Cleanup. By October 2004, Chairman Gross announced some 
recommendations on behalf of the Chesapeake Bay Blue Bay Ribbon Finance 
Panel.
  On the state and national level, Penny is a past president of the 
Virginia Association of Counties, vice-chair of the National 
Association of Counties&#x27; Energy, Environment, and Land Use Committee, 
and past president of the National Association of Regional Councils. 
She was first appointed by Governor Mark Warner to the Local Government 
Advisory Committee (LGAC) to the Chesapeake Executive Council, which 
she chaired from March 2006 until August 2008, and continues to serve.
  I had the great pleasure of serving with Penny during my 14 years on 
the Board, first representing the Providence District and then as 
Chairman. The work that she has done for Fairfax County is outstanding 
and we will continue to honor her legacy as a public servant. Penny 
Gross&#x27;s commitment to our community and the mission of local government 
is unparalleled. She leaves behind a legacy that will enrich our 
community for generations to come. Her career in public service is 
truly commendable and deserving of our heartfelt gratitude. All through 
her tenure as Chair of the PWR, she proved to be an exemplary leader, 
and continues to attract very influential and dedicated environmentally 
minded individuals to the roundtable
  Mr. Speaker, Pro Tempore Penny Gross&#x27;s commitment to public service 
is through her work in Fairfax County. Though she may be retiring, I 
suspect that she will continue to remain active in the causes that are 
important to her. I commend her for her service and ask my colleagues 
to join me in congratulating her on her retirement.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 6, 2023

  Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I rise 
to honor the legacy of the Union County Board of Commissioners Chair, 
Stony Dwight Rushing.
  Stony loved his family and he loved Union County. He was fiercely 
devoted to his wife, Anne-Marie, and his two children, Reagan and 
RyLee. Stony also served Union County for four terms on the Board of 
Commissioners from 2002 to 2006, and then again from 2014 to 2023. Over 
the course of these four terms, Stony&#x27;s fellow Board Members chose him 
to serve as Chairman for two of them. Stony was a congenial presence 
and a highly effective servant to his community. He stood for our God-
given rights and took every opportunity to make people&#x27;s lives better. 
His larger-than-life presence that still echoes throughout Union County 
will truly be missed.
  Outside of his involvement with the Union County Board of 
Commissioners, Stony mentored young North Carolinians on the importance 
of firearm proficiency and safety. Stony served as a certified firearms 
instructor and owner of Take Aim Training Range. In fact, he was the 
NRA South Carolina Youth Hunter Education Challenge State Coordinator, 
and was honored as the 2013 NC Governor&#x27;s Conservation Achievement 
Award winner for ``Hunter Education Instructor of the Year.&#x27;&#x27; Stony 
also served as the Union District Chairman for the Boy Scouts of 
America between 2006 and 2009.
  On behalf of the entire 8th Congressional District of North Carolina, 
I rise to honor and celebrate Chairman Stony Rushing&#x27;s fruitful life 
and dedicated service to others. I thank Stony and may he rest in 
peace.
