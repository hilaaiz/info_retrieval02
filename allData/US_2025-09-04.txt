I rise today in celebration of The Rock 
Church of Terrells 20th anniversary and to congratulate Pastor Gary 
Weems on his retirement and transition to a senior bishop role. Since 
its founding in 2005, The Rock Church of Terrell has been a symbol of 
love, hope, and faith to people from all walks of life in my hometown 
of Terrell, Texas.
  Pastor Gary began his ministry in Terrell in 1996, immediately 
offering himself and his family to the enrichment of our community. 
Alongside his wife, Jodi, Pastor Gary has dedicated his life to the 
service of the body of Christ and full-time ministry for 48 years. His 
faithfulness and love have made a profound and enduring impact on the 
Terrell community. In his absence, The Rock Church of Terrell will 
welcome a new generation of pastoral leadership. Pastor Garys son, 
Ben, will assume the role of Senior Pastor, continuing his fathers 
legacy of dedicated service. I wish the best for Pastor Ben and his 
wife, Chelsea, and Associate Pastor Bodie Jones and his wife, 
Stephanie, as they embark on this new journey.
I rise today to celebrate the launch 
of the Congressional Study Group on India (CSGI), and to applaud the 
visionary leadership of the Roundglass Foundation and its partners in 
standing up this groundbreaking initiative.
  Congressional Study Groups provide a vital platform for bipartisan 
exchanges that enable Members of Congress to engage in substantive 
policy discussions focused on strengthening Americas relationships 
with its partners, friends, and allies.
  India and America are crucial strategic partners, and that is why 
this new Congressional

Study Group is so important. As the fifth such group established by the 
U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress, the CSGI creates a 
dedicated, bipartisan forum for substantive discussions on trade, 
technology, energy, defense, and other issues that define the U.S.-
India relationship. This initiative will not only strengthen our 
strategic partnership, but also build greater understanding and 
collaboration between our two great democracies at a pivotal moment in 
history. The CSGI represents an investment in the future, one that 
advances shared priorities like national security, global health, and 
climate stewardship, while also reaffirming the enduring bonds between 
the American and Indian people.
  I would like to specifically extend my sincere gratitude to the 
Roundglass Foundation, established by Mr. Gurpreet ``Sunny Singh, for 
its marquee role in launching this groundbreaking initiative that will 
further strengthen the sacred bond between the United States and India. 
Under Mr Singhs visionary leadership, Roundglass has already 
championed numerous efforts that have expanded access to athletics, 
education, womens empowerment, and environmental stewardship, 
particularly for underserved communities. This new initiative is a 
shining example of that legacy, one that reflects Roundglass 
unwavering commitment to building a healthier, more inclusive, and more 
sustainable future for us all.
  As an Indian-American, I am deeply honored to recognize the work 
being done under Roundglass efforts to unlock the full potential of a 
strong U.S.-India relationship, one that can help build healthier and 
more resilient societies in both of our countries. The establishment of 
this Congressional Study Group on India holds the promise of guiding 
our nations toward a stronger, more cooperative future. For that, Mr 
Speaker, I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to 
Roundglass, to Mr. Singh, and to the additional partners who helped 
launch this ground-breaking program.

I rise to honor Peninsula Family Service and 
commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the founding of this impactful 
nonprofit, and its unique history and significance to my district.
  Peninsula Family Service was founded on April 24, 1950, responding to 
a need to provide counseling for veterans who had returned from World 
War II and their families. The San Francisco Bay Area has evolved over 
many decades, and Peninsula Family Service has been there every step of 
the way--providing support, caring for neighbors, and becoming a deeply 
trusted part of our community. Peninsula Family Service is well-known 
for its ability to adapt and respond to local needs, and it provides 
support to program participants at every stage of life, from children 
and families to adults over 100 years young. The organization has more 
than 45 programs, sites, and services, reaching 10,000 of our neighbors 
in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties in California. Today these 
services are more relevant than ever. The priority program areas for 
Peninsula Family Service are early learning, employment services, 
financial empowerment, and older adult services.
  The scope of Peninsula Family Service programs is broad: Older adults 
can participate in any one of numerous exercise classes, including Tai 
Chi and Zumba, or get a nutritious lunch, which is provided each day at 
the organizations Fair Oaks Adult Activity Center in Redwood City. The 
Fair Oaks Center is part of the Peninsula Family Services 
comprehensive approach to health, wellness and overcoming isolation for 
our older adults, all key components of its Overcoming Loneliness 
Initiative, through which the organization is a San Mateo County 
leader. Parents of children from birth to 5 years old are served at 
Peninsula Family Service early learning centers, of which there are 
soon to be eleven around San Mateo County. Each learning center 
provides high-quality child development and family support. One of 
these centers also provides programs for youth ages 6 to 12 years. All 
Peninsula Family Service centers provide this care and early learning 
to children of low-income families and households in poverty. Some 
children are unhoused and some may have experienced other trauma. 
Peninsula Family Service also offers financial education workshops for 
adults, and now also for teens ages 13 to 20 years of age.
  To honor its 75 years of unwavering service to the Bay Area, 
Peninsula Family Service is hosting a year-long celebration throughout 
2025 to recognize, thank and engage past, current, and future members 
of the Peninsula Family Service family. At the core of its 75th 
anniversary is a commitment to celebrating the many generations of 
program participants, staff, leadership, volunteers, auxiliaries, 
donors, and corporate and community partners, and their impact on our 
community.
  I am proud Peninsula Family Service is part of Californias 15th 
Congressional District. The organization stands as a testament to the 
power of responsiveness to community needs and the importance of 
providing support for our community. Peninsula Family Service honors 
all those who have been part of its past and looks forward to serving 
where community need remains great. As I reflect on the journey of 
Peninsula Family Service, I am reminded of the profound impact of 
nonprofits, such as Peninsula Family Service, that keep our communities 
healthy and strong. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me 
in celebrating Peninsula Family Services 75th Anniversary and wishing 
continued success in all future endeavors.
I rise today to honor the 
remarkable career and dedicated leadership of Sue Veer, who sadly 
passed away after nearly two decades of service as the president and 
CEO of Carolina Health Centers in Greenwood, South Carolina. She has 
left behind a strong legacy through her purposeful mentorship and 
healthcare advocacy.
  As president and CEO, Sue led 19 medical practices that provide care 
for more than 26,000 patients combined. Her colleagues, patients, and 
partners in the healthcare space admired her innovative goals for 
community health centers. She is said to have inspired those around her 
to aim higher and make a difference.

Community Health Centers and the South Carolina Primary Health Care 
Association. She championed local, state, and national priorities in 
the health center movement and will be remembered as a committed 
visionary. In her national work, she was a founding member of a

  Prior to her career in community health, Sue faced a life-threatening 
tragedy. A devastating dam failure caused extensive damage and heavy 
flooding in her town. This disastrous incident took the life of her 
young daughter. According to Sue, the kindness demonstrated by the 
healthcare professionals who treated her injuries and helped her move 
forward proved to be an inspiration. Her survival story, and the 
healthcare professionals at the forefront, led her to pursue a career 
in community health and sympathize with patients every step of the way.

and friends will be cherished and fondly missed. She is said to have 
cultivated many deep connections, and I pray for her family, friends, 
and loved ones as we all mourn her loss.

I rise today to honor and recognize an 
extraordinary American patriot, Sergeant Major Troy E. Black, United 
States Marine Corps, on the occasion of his retirement following a 
distinguished 37-year career in faithful service to our Nation.
  Sergeant Major Blacks journey began in Louisville, Kentucky, where 
the values of duty, discipline, and perseverance were instilled early 
in his life. In July 1988, he answered the call to serve and reported 
to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. There, he began a journey 
that would span nearly four decades and see him rise to the highest 
enlisted ranks in the Marine Corps and in our Armed Forces.
  After completing infantry school and earning his military 
occupational specialty as an 0331-Machine Gunner, Sergeant Major Black 
trained at Marine Security Force School before deploying aboard the USS 
Forrestal (CV-59) in support of Operation Just Cause. He deployed again 
in 1990 with the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines to Kuwait during Operation 
Desert Shield and Desert Storm.
  From the beginning, Sergeant Major Black distinguished himself not 
only through valor in combat but also as a dedicated mentor and leader. 
He served as a two-time drill instructor at Parris Island, ultimately 
rising to the roles of Senior Drill Instructor, Drill Instructor School 
Instructor, and Drill Master of the Recruit Training Regiment. It was 
there, fittingly at the very birthplace of Marine transformation, that 
he met his wife Stacie, herself a proud Marine who would later retire 
as a First Sergeant.
  Following the tragic attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001, 
Sergeant Major Black deployed repeatedly to the frontlines of the 
Global War on Terror. With the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, he completed 
two combat deployments to Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom, and 
later, with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, he deployed twice more to 
Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
  In one unforgettable moment of heroism, Sergeant Major Black ran 
through uncleared territory to rescue a wounded Marine struck by an 
IED. For this act of extraordinary courage under fire, he was awarded 
the Bronze Star Medal with Combat ``V, a testament to his unwavering 
commitment to those he led.
  His exceptional leadership culminated in his appointment as the 19th 
Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, the highest enlisted position in 
that service, and subsequently as the 5th Senior Enlisted Advisor to 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the most senior enlisted 
position in the entire U.S. Armed Forces.
  Over the course of nearly four decades, Sergeant Major Blacks work 
has had an immeasurable impact on our Joint Forces servicemembers and 
the civilian employees of the Department of Defense. His dedication to 
the mission, to the men and women and then families who accomplish it, 
and his tireless efforts to lead from the front, have contributed to 
the safety and security of all Americans. Today, his legacy lives on 
through the Black family, with their daughter, Corporal Arewynn Black, 
following in her parents footsteps in the Marine Corps.
  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I offer my deepest thanks and best 
wishes to Sergeant Major Troy Black, to 1st Sergeant Major Stacie 
Black, and to their entire family as they begin this well-earned new 
chapter.
I rise today to recognize a remarkable 
landmark of our history from my hometown of South Dayton. For 150 
years, the South Dayton Depot has been a center of connection, culture, 
and community spirit. Since its founding in 1875, the South Dayton 
Depot has welcomed generations of travelers and neighbors, serving 
first as a vital hub for freight and passenger service, and now as a 
museum where history is preserved for generations to come.
  The South Dayton Depot has not only preserved our communitys 
railroad heritage, but has also become a gathering place where 
neighbors connect and visitors experience the rich story of our region. 
From its role in major motion pictures like The Natural and Planes, 
Trains and Automobiles, to its continued service through the Movie and 
Rail Museum, the South Dayton Depot stands as a living link between our 
past and present.
  On September 6, 2025, the Village of South Dayton will celebrate the 
South Dayton Depots 150th anniversary with a community celebration 
that honors both its historic legacy and its enduring role as the heart 
of the village. Thanks to the dedication of local leaders,

volunteers, and preservation groups, the South Dayton Depot continues 
to thrive as a source of pride for the entire region.
  I ask that the United States House of Representatives join me in 
honoring the enduring legacy of the South Dayton Depot and congratulate 
them on this important milestone.
I rise today to welcome to Washington, 
D.C., His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual 
leader of Orthodox Christianity worldwide. As Archbishop of 
Constantinople--New Rome, His All-Holiness is recognized as the ``first 
among equals of Orthodox Primates and shepherds more than 300 million 
faithful across the globe.
  Since his election in 1991, Patriarch Bartholomew has been an 
unwavering advocate for peace, interfaith dialogue, religious freedom, 
and environmental stewardship, earning him the title of ``Green 
Patriarch and international recognition for his vision of 
reconciliation and unity. He has convened historic gatherings of 
Orthodox leaders, fostered dialogue with other Christian traditions, 
and extended a hand of friendship to leaders of the Jewish and Muslim 
faiths.
  In South Carolinas 4th District, the Greek Orthodox community has 
been a vital part of our religious and cultural life. Families in 
Greenville and Spartanburg have shared their faith and traditions for 
generations, strengthening the bonds of community and enriching the 
fabric of our state.

  On behalf of my constituents in South Carolinas 4th District, 
including the faithful at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in 
Spartanburg, I extend a warm welcome to His All-Holiness Ecumenical 
Patriarch Bartholomew. His presence in Washington is a reminder of the 
enduring bonds of faith, freedom, and shared values that unite people 
of all backgrounds.
