I rise today to commend and celebrate the 
exceptional interns who have devoted their summer to serving the people 
of Californias 20th Congressional District. From my offices in 
Washington, D.C., and Bakersfield, California these students have 
exhibited maturity well beyond their years, offering their time, 
talents, and energy to support my work in meaningful ways. Their 
contributions have been a powerful reminder of the potential and 
promise embodied by the next generation. At a time when many young 
Americans are contemplating their role in civic life, these interns 
chose to engage directly with purpose and passion.
  As all the summer Congressional internships come to a close, I want 
to express my deepest gratitude to Nikhil Bawa for his contributions to 
my Washington, D.C. office. His hard work has been instrumental to my 
teams efforts, and I am confident that the experiences and lessons he 
has gained will guide him toward continued success in his future 
endeavors in public service. I look forward to seeing where his path 
leads, and I hope that path includes a continued dedication to serving 
others.
I rise today to recognize Carroll Lee 
Ashburn for his community service and civic leadership to the Northern 
Neck. The influence Carroll has shown on his community over the years 
has cemented his legacy as a legendary softball coach, manager, sports 
broadcaster, and local historian.
  Carroll Ashburn served his country in the United States Coast Guard, 
was a softball coach of the legendary Texacos Fast Ball Pitch Softball 
team, managed the girls fast pitch softball team, and started the 
Girls Little League Softball program in Kilmarnock at Lancasters 
Youth Park. Mr. Ashburn later became a broadcaster for High School 
Radio Sports on WKWI Radio, now Bay FM 101.7, where he served as the 
voice of high school basketball in the Northern Neck for over 25 years.
  In 2007, Carroll Ashburn became the President of the Kilmarnock 
Museum, a position he still holds. Carroll has promoted and help 
produce several documentaries highlighting the history of the Northern 
Neck, including Kilmarnock, Virginia Living History; The Pirates of the 
Chesapeake Bay; Historic Churches of Virginias Northern Neck; Rear 
Admiral Bert Chase--A Dream of Flight, and A Fish Story. Mr. Ashburn, a 
born-and-raised Northern Necker, brings a wealth of knowledge about the 
valuable history of the region. If one wants to know how the Chesapeake 
Bay built the Northern Neck or how the Northern Neck built the 
Chesapeake Bay, go no further than Carroll Lee Ashburn.
  Today at 93, Carroll remains busy by hosting trips to Tangier Island 
from Hummell Field in Topping with his favorite pilot, Davy Nichols, in 
a 1970 Cessna.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Carroll Lee 
Ashburn for his extraordinary contributions to the Northern Neck 
Community and in expressing our deepest appreciation for his lasting 
impact on our unique community.
I rise today to honor a true American hero 
from Southeast Texas--PFC Kate Louise Pate-Walker.
  Kate was part of the legendary Six Triple Eight, the 6888th Central 
Postal Directory Battalion. It was the only all-Black, all-female unit 
deployed overseas during World War II. Their mission was clear: sort 
and deliver a massive backlog of mail to nearly seven million U.S. 
troops. Morale depended on it.
  They were given six months. They did it in three.
  The work of the Six Triple Eight went far beyond mail--it was about 
dignity, hope, and connection. For soldiers far from home, a letter 
meant everything. Kate and her fellow women knew that, and their 
determination lifted the spirits of our fighting forces in Europe.
  Kate earned multiple military honors for her service, and when the 
war ended, she returned home to Texas, married, raised a beautiful 
family, and continued a life of service to her community.
  Born in Vidor and raised in Sour Lake, Kate was a trailblazer in 
uniform and a leader at home. She lived a life defined by faith, 
perseverance, and love for family and country.
  And now--decades later--the women of the Six Triple Eight have 
finally received the Congressional Gold Medal. Though the recognition 
came late, it is highly deserved. Their bravery, sacrifice, and 
determination are part of our Nations story, and Southeast Texas is 
proud to claim PFC Kate Pate-Walker as one of our own.
, may her memory and legacy of service continue to inspire 
future generations of Americans to answer the call of duty with 
courage.
I rise today to honor a 
lifelong educator, community matriarch, and steadfast servant leader, 
, Mississippi.
. 
That truth finds a shining example in the remarkable career and impact 
of Mrs. Ross, who faithfully served 41 consecutive years with Central 
Mississippi, Inc. Head Start, shaping the lives of more than 2,400 
children across Holmes County.
a part-
time secretary at the

Holly Grove Head Start Center. Through her dedication and love for 
children, she rose to become a teacher, then head teacher, and 
eventually center manager. Even after the closing of Holly Grove, her 
commitment never wavered. She continued to serve with excellence at the 
Goodman Head Start Center until her recent retirement.
  More than an educator, Mrs. Ross was a life-mentor. From her handmade 
brown-paper-bag puppets ``Mr. Do and ``Mr. Dont, to the life 
lessons she instilled in every classroom, she taught not only ABCs and 
123s, but discipline, respect, and purpose. Her former students have 
gone on to become teachers, entrepreneurs, ministers, realtors, health 
professionals, farmers, public servants, and even Head Start managers 
themselves. In every one of their stories, her legacy endures.
  She holds a national Child Development Associate credential and has 
received numerous awards throughout her career. Yet, her greatest 
reward came from the joy of watching children grow, thrive, and 
succeed--and from the unwavering support of her late husband, Mr. 
Albert Ross, her daughters Rose Berry, Lawanda Ross, and Pamela Wiley, 
and her beloved grandchildren.
  Even in retirement, Mrs. Ross remains a pillar of the Mt. Olive 
Missionary Baptist Church in Lexington, Mississippi, where her 
celebration drew nearly 100 well-wishers--friends, family, and former 
students who came from as far as the West Coast and Chicago. The event 
featured touching tributes, musical performances, and reflections from 
those whose lives she touched most deeply.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and 
celebrating Mrs. Monzola Randle Ross for her extraordinary devotion to 
early childhood education, her love for her community, and her enduring 
legacy of compassion, excellence, and service. Mississippi is better 
because of her.
I rise today to honor the extraordinary life 
and legacy of a Civil Rights icon and community leader, Bishop Calvin 
W. Woods, Sr., who passed away on August 16, 2025, at the age of 91.
  A native of Alabamas 7th Congressional District, Bishop Woods was 
born on September 13, 1933, in Birmingham, Alabama, to the late Maggie 
Rosa Lee Wallace Woods and Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr.
  Bishop Woods received his Bachelor of Arts from Miles College before 
continuing his education at Birmingham Baptist College. He went on to 
complete multiple degrees at the Universal Bible Institute, Union 
Baptist Seminary, and the School of Truth. Woods is also a graduate of 
the Urban Training Center for Christian Missions and obtained a 
certificate for police communications from Samford University.

  In 1956, Bishop Woods joined his brother Reverend Abraham L. Woods, 
Jr., and Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth to co-found the Alabama 
Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR). Through this work, Bishop 
Woods began the journey of what would become six decades of courageous 
leadership throughout the Civil Rights Movement. Working closely with 
. and supporting the work of Reverend Fred L. 
Shuttlesworth, Bishop Woods challenged segregation directly, 
participating in numerous demonstrations, including the Birmingham 
Campaign and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963. 
Though his participation in the Movement resulted in him being beaten, 
arrested, and fired from his job, he continued to fight for justice and 
equality for all. He planned strategies for public protests following 
the shooting of five African Americans who had been protesting at a 
supermarket during the 1960s and filed a lawsuit on behalf of the youth 
suspended from school during the demonstration to ensure that they 
could be reinstated.
  As a result of his tenacity and dedication, Bishop Woods was 
appointed by Dr. King as the SCLC City Convener for the Birmingham 
Ministers Leadership Conference. In this position, Bishop Woods was 
responsible for educating ministers concerning Black History, 
picketing, housing, direct non-violent protesting, voter registration, 
and negotiations to ensure that they were fully equipped to continue 
leading their congregations throughout the Movement.
  In addition to his work as a Civil Rights leader, Bishop Woods played 
a vital role in the Birmingham community through his various community 
affiliations and as the pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church in Birmingham, 
Alabama, where he led the congregation for more than three decades. 
Throughout his life, Bishop Woods served in many leadership capacities, 
including as the Discipline &amp; Administration and Evening Supervisor for 
Community Ed School at Parker High School, a board member of the 
Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, the President of the New Era Baptist 
State Convention of AL, the Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees of 
Birmingham Easonian Baptist Bible College, and a member of the National 
Baptist Convention, USA Inc. Board of Directors.
, Lucille Grayson 
Woods; his parents, Rev. Abraham Lincoln Woods, Sr. and Maggie Woods; 
his brothers, Rev. Abraham Lincoln Woods, Jr., Dr. Roy Woods, Sr., 
Franklin Delorna Woods, and Dr. Dwight Edward Woods; his sisters, Mary 
Ruby Woods Hutchinson, Melzer Woods Luke, and Lois Woods, his 
daughters, Linda Cal Woods Holt, and Shelia Vanessa Woods Minter; his 
son, Dr. Freedom Progress Woods, Sr., and his granddaughter, Tamecia 
LaShun Woods. He is survived by his children, Jeanette Marie Woods 
Smith, Judy Kay Woods, Dr. Calvin Wallace Woods, Jr., (Minister 
Constance), Carlton Wayne Woods, Sr., Rev. Byron Elliott Woods, 
Christopher Wyatt Woods, Minister Joyce Elaine Woods Lewis (Dr. 
Tommie), Minister Angela Gay Woods McClure (Dr. Micheal), Dr. Timothy 
Justice Woods, Sr., and Dr. Quintin Prescott Woods, Sr. (Tramella); his 
thirty-seven grandchildren, his sixty-eight great-grandchildren, his 
eleven great great-grandchildren; his two daughter-in laws, his two 
son-in laws, his thirty-three nieces and nephews, his sixty-one great 
nieces and nephews, and a host other ministers of the gospel, cousins, 
family, and dear friends.
  On a personal note, the contributions that Bishop Woods made to 
ensure the equal rights of all Americans during the Civil Rights 
Movement were truly exemplary. I know that I get to represent my home 
district as Alabamas first Black Congresswoman because of his 
courageous efforts. To call him an icon of the Movement is an 
understatement. His unwavering commitment to improving the lives of 
black Alabamians had a profound effect on our community and will 
continue to be felt for generations to come. His life stands as a 
testament to the power of ordinary Americans to achieve extraordinary 
social change. His legacy will live on with every vote cast and in the 
many lives he impacted. May he rest in peace and power.
  On behalf of Alabamas 7th Congressional District, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy 
of Bishop Calvin W. Woods, Sr. for his contributions to generations of 
civil rights leaders and decades of exemplary service to our Nation in 
our fight for liberty, equality, and justice for all.
I rise today to recognize the life of 
Harriett Burt.
  Harriett was born in Alameda, California in 1940. Throughout her 
life, Harriett demonstrated her compassion and dedication to service. 
She followed in her parents footsteps, becoming a teacher and 
educator. She moved to Martinez, California shortly after college to 
teach at Martinez Junior High and later taught in Australia before 
stepping into administrative and consulting roles in the education 
field. Her work took her throughout the United States and Canada. 
Additionally, Harriett was deeply passionate about serving her 
community. She was a journalist for the Martinez News-Gazette and 
served on the Martinez City Council, the citys planning commission, 
and the California Public Utilities Commission.
  She was an active member of our community, a part of the Boys and 
Girls Club, the Soroptimist Club, the Martinez Education Association, 
Kiwanis, the Lyons Club, the American Association of University Women 
(AAUW), and more. Additionally, she was the first woman to serve as 
board president for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Contra Costa. 
Harrietts leadership in the community has had a profound impact on 
countless lives and has paved the way for future generations.
  Sadly, Harriett recently passed away at the age of 85. She will be 
remembered for her indelible impact in Martinez and beyond and for her 
intellect, warmth, and kindness. Please join me in recognizing Harriett 
Burt for her many contributions to our community.
I rise today to recognize and honor the 
distinguished career of Tom Torlakson, a dedicated public servant and 
steadfast advocate for Californias students, families and educators.
  Toms career in service began in the classroom. As a high school 
science teacher and coach in the Mount Diablo Unified School District, 
he saw firsthand the transformative power of education. His early 
experience in education shaped a lifelong commitment to ensuring that 
every child could learn, grow, and succeed, regardless of their 
background or zip code.
  Recognizing the broader systemic challenges facing education, Mr. 
Torlakson entered public office to expand his impact. He served on the 
Antioch City Council and the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors, 
where he advocated for stronger schools, safer communities, and greater 
opportunities for all residents. His leadership in local government 
paved the way for his election to the California State Assembly and 
later the California State Senate, where he continued to be a leading 
voice on education and public health policy.
  During his tenure in the California Legislature, Mr. Torlakson 
authored significant legislation that fundamentally improved the lives 
of millions. Among his many accomplishments, he was instrumental in 
establishing Californias system of after-school programs, the largest 
after-school program system in the nation, providing students with 
safe, enriching environments after school hours. He also spearheaded 
the Quality Education Investment Act (SB 1133), securing billions of 
dollars in critical funding to support the states most challenged 
schools and reduce educational inequities.
  In 2011, Tom was elected as Californias 27th State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, a position he held with honor and distinction until 
2019. As superintendent, he championed initiatives to close the digital 
divide, address achievements gaps, reduce dropout rates, and promote 
innovative programs such as the State Seal of Biliteracy, recognizing 
students who achieved proficiency in multiple languages. His leadership 
was key in preserving vital resources for schools and safeguarding 
educational opportunities for Californias six million students, 
despite the states budget challenges.
  Beyond policy achievements, Toms tenure was marked by his 
compassionate nature, which underscored his belief that the future of 
our communities, our economy, and our democracy depends on how we 
nurture and educate our young people. He worked collaboratively with 
educators, parents, and policymakers to foster a culture of inclusion, 
innovation, and excellence.
, it is fitting that we recognize Tom Torlakson today not 
only for his extraordinary record of public service but also for the 
profound and positive difference he has made in countless lives. His 
steadfast commitment to education and public welfare stands as an 
enduring example to us all. Please join me in honoring Tom Torlakson 
for his lifetime of service, leadership, and dedication to the people 
of California.
I rise today to honor Mrs. Tonya Lacey for 
her 33 years of service in the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia. A 
proud graduate of James Monroe High School here in Fredericksburg, Mrs. 
Laceys commitment to her local community has been nothing short of 
inspiring.
  Throughout her career, she has demonstrated unwavering dedication to 
public service, embodying the spirit of community in every role she has 
held.
  Beginning in 1992, Mrs. Laceys journey with the City of 
Fredericksburg began as a receptionist in the City Managers Office. 
She went on to serve as the Secretary of the Planning Department from 
1999 to 2002, and as Secretary to the City Manager from 2002 to 2009. 
In her most recent role, she is the first African-American woman to 
serve as Fredericksburgs Clerk of Council, a groundbreaking 
achievement that broke barriers and paved the way for future 
generations.
  In her years of service, Mrs. Lacey received several professional 
accolades including her Certified Municipal Clerk (CMC) certification 
and Master Municipal Clerk (MMC) certification. Mrs. Lacey repeatedly 
demonstrated her commitment to excellence in effort and actions when it 
came to attending 411 City Council meetings and 452 work sessions, and 
processing and managing 797 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, 
and in documenting the factual record with over 7,617 pages of City 
Council meeting minutes in the historic record of Council.
  As Clerk of Council, Mrs. Lacey guided our community by keeping the 
community informed about the operations performed by the government. 
She worked with the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and City Council, keeping 
official records, responding to citizen inquiries and keeping citizens 
informed about City Council actions. She acted as the Freedom of 
Information Officer (FOIA) and Records Manager for the City of 
Fredericksburg, which was a vital position in the continuity of 
transparency and public access.
, I would like to personally thank Mrs. Lacey for her 
remarkable 33 years of service in our community. We are grateful for 
her tireless efforts to ensure that our government operates smoothly 
and that our citizens are well-served.
today, I introduce a bill that would require 
members of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard, deployed in 
the District of Columbia in response to an order of the President 
relating to crime or civil disturbance in D.C. to participate in a 
program substantially similar to the body-worn camera program of D.C.s 
police department, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). This bill 
would apply to the current deployment of troops and any future 
deployment.
  The use of body cameras by troops during deployments related to crime 
or civil disturbance in D.C. would promote transparency in the troops 
interactions with the public and protect the public and the troops. MPD 
has a well-established program for the use of body cameras, as well as 
for the preservation and disclosure of body camera footage.
  The Trump administration has deployed more than 2,000 National Guard 
troops in D.C. This deployment is a raw assertion of power over the 
more than 700,000 disenfranchised D.C. residents, a majority of whom 
are Black and Brown; a politicization of the military; a disservice to 
the members of the National Guard and their families, unwarranted, and 
possibly unlawful with respect to both the D.C. National Guard and the 
state National Guards. I have urged the administration to remove these 
troops immediately.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
I rise today to include in the Record an 
opinion column from the Odessa American titled ``Campbell: The Nature 
of Truth, published May 1, 2025. In it, the author reflects on how 
society grapples with competing claims of truth and encourages readers 
to return to foundational and verifiable sources--a theme with deep 
implications for both our civic culture and the way we approach 
legislation.
  I believe this thoughtful reflection is a meaningful reminder of the 
importance of clarity, honesty, and shared understanding in democratic 
discourse.

       Truth is ephemeral in the temporal world. It seems that 
     everyone has his or her own version and whether or not they 
     actually know the truth is open to interpretation and subject 
     to ones own preference or prejudice. Its a key concept in 
     my business, journalism, where truth is the lynchpin. We are 
     bound to be truthful to the best of our ability and we are 
     prohibited from writing anything that we know to be false. We 
     can be fired for doing it.
       Thats the difference between the Odessa American and 
     publications like the National Enquirer, which publish 
     nothing but stories that they know to be untrue. Thats not 
     to say we never publish falsehoods, but we dont do it 
     deliberately. Its that we have good reasons like credible 
     sources and reliable references to believe that what we write 
     is true.
       In the case of political candidates, if we had to believe 
     everything they say we would never write anything about them. 
     Were not saying that what they say is true. Were saying 
     its true that that is what they said. We attribute 
     accurately and leave it to the readers to ascribe credibility 
     or not.

       There has never been a newspaper or a book written that had 
     nothing false in it. Only one book is 100 percent true: the 
     Bible. God cannot lie and we may be certain that every word 
     of the Bible is true.
       Depending on the translation, Jesus 75-80 times in the 
     Gospels uses the phrase ``I tell you the truth or 
     variations of it and in John 14:5 he is even more specific 
     when he says, ``I am the way, the truth and the life. So he 
     was not just telling the truth, he was and is the truth. He 
     embodies it. I think Jesus emphasized the truth and the fact 
     that he was always telling it because he understood the 
     inherent deceitfulness of the world. He was saying, if you 
     want the pure truth, look to me.
       At the end of Revelation we see the importance of this 
     issue when it says that everyone who loves and practices 
     falsehood is classified with the sexually immoral, murderers 
     and idolators as being among those who will be damned. Of 
     course some people occasionally tell white lies in deference 
     to the feelings of those they love, but then people who are 
     always strictly truthful are often respected for it and their 
     candor is accepted in deference to the values they espouse.
       Truth derives from wisdom and like wisdom it is more 
     valuable than much pure gold and sweeter than honey from the 
     honeycomb. The English philosopher Francis Bacon (1561-1626) 
     said truth is the child of time, meaning that it emerges and 
     is revealed through the passage of time, not through 
     someones immediate authority or declaration.
       When we hear things privately or in the public arena, if 
     the truth of them is not discernible we may be confident that 
     time will show the truth. The political writers adage is 
     that nothing anyone says during a campaign may be true, but 
     during the course of it the truth will become clear and the 
     voters will know whom to vote for from the total body of the 
     dialogue. German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) said 
     lying steals ones dignity and we know from Scripture that 
     God wants us to maintain our dignity as Christians by 
     avoiding such things.
       Stone-Campbell Church Movement leader Alexander Campbell 
     (1788-1866) advocated for a rational and deliberative 
     understanding of Christianity, firmly rooted in the New 
     Testament. He opposed both speculative theology and emotional 
     revivalism, emphasizing a return to the Bible as the primary 
     source of truth. Campbell advocated for a focus on biblical 
     text and avoided theological systems that relied on 
     philosophical or speculative reasoning.
       Truth derives from the wisdom developed through the fear of 
     the Lord and wisdom and truth are indispensable in our 
     pursuit of virtue. How may we obtain these treasures of the 
     Holy Spirit? Of course, through prayer, reading Scripture, 
     attending church and fellowshipping with other Christians.
       Pray and ask God for the wisdom to discern truth and 
     succeed in our ever-advancing pursuit of higher and higher 
     virtue. Ask to be empowered to bear well the responsibility 
     of being a link in the multi-generational sustenance and 
     progress of good character in your family. Ask for a complete 
     God-given understanding of the nature and importance of truth 
     and thereby avoid the errors that can set back or thwart your 
     spiritual goals.
I include in the Record the 
following proclamation recognizing Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, 
Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome.

       Whereas, on September 15, we will welcome His All-Holiness 
     Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, Archbishop of 
     Constantinople-New Rome to Washington, D.C., to receive the 
     Templeton Prize, the worlds most prestigious award in 
     Religion and Science;
       Whereas, His All-Holiness is the spiritual leader and 
     Primus inter pares (``Fast among Equals) of Orthodox 
     Christianity worldwide--a Church of 30 million individuals--
     and is the longest-serving Archbishop of Constantinople;
       Whereas, in 1997, His All-Holiness was awarded the 
     Congressional Gold Medal and declared that pollution, 
     deforestation, and climate change, among other acts harmful 
     to the environment, should be considered ``ecological sin 
     and moral failings, as opposed to merely practical missteps;
       Whereas, he has worked to guide the Orthodox Christian 
     Church in an environmentally conscious and Godly way, helping

     to develop a strong community of faith, and has presided over 
     events including the 150th anniversary of the Theological 
     School of Halki and the 500th anniversary of the Greek 
     Orthodox Community in Venice, among others;
       Whereas, he has visited the United States during the 
     Clinton (1997), Bush (2004), Obama (2009) and Biden (2021) 
     administrations;
       Whereas, His All-Holiness was elected in October 1991 as 
     the 270th Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome and 
     Ecumenical Patriarch, and has served for nearly 34 years;
       Whereas, His All-Holiness has authored four books in 
     English and has been invited to speak before the United 
     Nations, the European Union, UNESCO, and the World Economic 
     Forum; and
       Now, therefore be it resolved, that I Robin L. Kelly, 
     serving as a member of the House of Representatives, 
     recognize and honor the remarkable work and accomplishments 
     of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, 
     Archbishop of Constantinople-New Rome.
I rise today to recognize the Liberty Corner 
Fire Company, an essential part of Bernards Township, Somerset County, 
for its steadfast and selfless service to our community for 115 years. 
Since 1910, the Liberty Corner Fire Companys enduring strength has 
been built not only on the courage of its members but also on the

continue their mission safely and effectively. Generations of families 
in Bernards Township have worn the uniform of Liberty Corner Fire 
Company, making it both a proud tradition and a vital lifeline.
, as Bernards Township hosts its upcoming First Responders 
Appreciation Night, I am especially proud to commend Liberty Corner 
Fire Company for its unwavering commitment and remarkable legacy of 
more than a century of service to our community. I invite my colleagues

to protecting our neighbors is a shining example of community spirit 
and sacrifice.
I rise today to honor a loving mother, 
dedicated grandmother, trailblazing leader, dedicated community servant

  Juanita Carson Booker is not only a devoted mother and grandmother, 
but also a cherished friend and mentor to many. Her kindness, grace, 
and integrity serve as a model for us all and remind us of the profound 
impact one individual can have on the community.
  On a personal note, it has been an honor to know Mrs. Booker for 
almost five decades. I will always cherish her friendship as well as 
her sage counsel and advice that have been invaluable to me as I have 
served in Congress. Accordingly, the impact of her life is inspiring 
and exemplifies the kind of love and devotion to others for which we 
should all aspire.
, I ask my colleagues to join my wife Vivian and me, along 
with the more than 765,000 people of Georgias Second Congressional 
District in honoring the life and service of Mrs. Juanita Carson Booker 
on the occasion of her 95th birthday.
I rise today to recognize Mead Johnson, a 
global leader in science-backed pediatric nutrition, as they celebrate 
120 years of leadership and innovation in the field. Mead Johnsons 
flagship manufacturing and R&amp;D center was created in Evansville over 
100 years ago and still stands as one of the largest manufacturing 
facilities for infant formulas.
  The Mead Johnson story began with the founder, Edward Mead Johnson 
and his son, who was born with a condition that made it difficult for 
him to digest his feedings. He worked with Dr. Abraham Jacobi, known as 
the father of American pediatrics, to create the first scientifically-
based infant formula that saved his sons life. Since then, Mead 
Johnson has become a world leader with a mission to nourish the worlds 
children for the best start in life. Meads dextri-maltose was the 
first clinically supported infant feed product in the U.S. Today, the 
Enfamil family of formulas developed in Evansville support infant 
nutrition across the globe, and Enfamil is the top infant formula brand 
recommended by pediatricians in the U.S.
  Mead Johnson has hired thousands of people in and around Evansville 
throughout their history and currently employs nearly 800 employees 
working across 25 departments. Nearly 20 percent of their employees 
have been with the company for 15 or more years, showing how much 
people value being a part of the Mead Johnson mission. Meads R&amp;D 
strength comes from a deep bench of diverse experts working across 
disciplines to advance infant nutrition.
  New scientific discoveries made in Evansville have allowed Mead 
Johnson to innovate and evolve their products. One of the heritage 
innovations is the addition of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid that is 
critical for infant brain and eye development. Mead Johnson was the 
first in the U.S. to introduce DHA into infant formula in 2002 which is 
now widely recognized as a standard of care in infant nutrition. I 
commend Mead Johnson and the important work their team accomplishes in 
advancing pediatric nutrition and nourishing the worlds children, 
starting in Southern Indiana.
