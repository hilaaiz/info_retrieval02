 CONGRATULATING SOUTH DAKOTA&#x27;S AIR NATIONAL GUARD&#x27;S 114TH FIGHTER WING

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. DUSTY JOHNSON

                            of south dakota

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the South Dakota Air National Guard&#x27;s 114th Fighter Wing, which 
recently received three top national honors at the National Guard 
Association of the

[[Page E837]]

United States Conference. They were awarded the Distinguished Flying 
Unit Plaque, the Winston P. Wilson Trophy, and the Major General John 
J. Pesch Flight Safety Trophy.
  These awards reflect the Wing&#x27;s nearly 80 years of excellence. Over 
the past year, the 114th deployed twice, once to the Pacific and once 
to the Middle East, while maintaining outstanding readiness at home. 
Their record has once again placed them among the very best in the 
Nation.
  This recognition highlights the leadership of Colonel Brandon Eskam 
and the commitment of every Airman in the unit. As Major General Mark 
Morrell noted, these honors are not pursued, but earned through 
professionalism, discipline, and daily dedication. The 114th represents 
the best of South Dakota and a standard of excellence for the entire 
Air National Guard.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in 
congratulating the 114th Fighter Wing on these well-deserved honors and 
in thanking them for their service to South Dakota and the United 
States.

CONGRATULATING THE TOMLINS, THE 2025 OKALOOSA COUNTY FARM FAMILY OF THE 
                                  YEAR

                                  _____

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Mr. PATRONIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Tomlin family of 
Crestview, Florida, who have been named the 2025 Okaloosa County 
Outstanding Farm Family of the Year. This recognition is part of the 
Okaloosa County Farm Bureau&#x27;s 75th Annual Membership Meeting, a 
gathering that celebrates the strength of our agricultural community.
  Cory and Jennifer Tomlin, together with their children Harper, 
Hadley, and Haylyn, represent the very best of Florida agriculture. 
Their family has carried forward a proud legacy of fanning that began 
in 1982 when Jennifer&#x27;s grandfather, Mr. Joe Bundrick, established 
their beekeeping operation. Today, with the guidance of Mr. Bundrick 
and the leadership of Jennifer&#x27;s father, Ken, the Tomlins manage about 
400 hives annually. Their farm produces honey, provides pollinator 
services, and serves the community through both wholesale and retail 
operations, including a storefront offering honey and beekeeping 
supplies.
  The Tomlin family&#x27;s dedication goes well beyond their farm. Jennifer 
serves as the Children&#x27;s Ministry Leader at Dorcas Baptist Church, 
Harper is an active 4-H member, and every member of the family 
contributes to the success of their agricultural operation. Together, 
they exemplify the values of faith, family, and stewardship that 
sustain rural communities across America.
  Four generations have worked this farm, and the Tomlins are committed 
to ensuring it continues for generations to come. Their story reflects 
not only the resilience of farm families in Northwest Florida but also 
the essential role of agriculture in our Nation&#x27;s future.
  On behalf of the United States Congress, I commend the Tomlin family 
for their outstanding contributions to agriculture and community life. 
They are most deserving of this year&#x27;s recognition as the Okaloosa 
County Farm Family of the Year.

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. MIKE QUIGLEY

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and 
legacy of Bob Newhart, TV star and comedian.
  In 1972, The Bob Newhart Show premiered and catapulted Bob into a new 
tier of critical acclaim, adoration, and commercial success. Known for 
its dry humor and heart, The Bob Newhart Show drew millions of viewers 
into a Chicago-based story about a psychologist and his clients and 
friends. With incredibly strong ratings and significant praise, the 
show ran for six seasons, leading to his other acclaimed show, Newhart. 
Through these efforts, Bob connected with homes and families through 
his extraordinary storytelling skills. He was described by coworkers 
and friends as kind, funny, and intellectual, and is remembered as 
humble and warm despite his fame.
  Before reaching comedic stardom, Bob graduated from Loyola University 
Chicago with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business management. He then served 
two years in the Army during the Korean War and held jobs in accounting 
prior to recording the comedy album that won him Album of the Year at 
the 1961 Grammys, ``The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&#x27;&#x27;. Bob had a 
love of philanthropy and used his comedic talents to emcee at various 
benefits from childhood cancer to Scleroderma research. He was adamant 
about using his career and success for the benefit of others and showed 
the world how important that mission was to him by raising $350,000 for 
the National Children&#x27;s Cancer Society.
  Bob was a true Chicagoan and proved that through the exposure he gave 
the city in his show as well as his enthusiastic support for the Cubs. 
The city is proud to honor his life and legacy through renaming the 
street by the Edgewater condominium to ``Bob Newhart Way&#x27;&#x27;. Thanks to 
him, this building is one of the most recognizable in Chicago, 
appearing in The Bob Newhart Show&#x27;s opening credits for 142 episodes.
  The city of Chicago and the whole country have lost an incredible 
figure who shaped modern comedy and sitcom TV, and he will be dearly 
missed. His legacy lives on through his children, grandchildren, and 
friends, and he will be remembered by the lives that he touched through 
his work and philanthropic efforts. I am forever grateful to Bob for 
shining a light on this incredible city and showing was it means to be 
a true legend.

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2025. the Rotary 
Club of Orange Park Sunrise will once again raise ``Flags for Heroes,&#x27;&#x27; 
a moving sea of hundreds of American flags honoring the men and women 
who lift our communities every day.
  In Clay County and across Northeast Florida, we remember the lives 
lost on September 11, 2001, and we salute the heroes who still answer 
the call: first responders, service members, veterans, teachers, 
nurses, and the quiet volunteers who serve without fanfare. Each flag 
carries a name, a story, and a promise that we will never forget.
  I commend the Rotarians, sponsors, and families who make this 
commemoration possible, and I invite neighbors to walk among the flags, 
reflect, and thank a hero in their life. America is strongest when 
service is celebrated, and sacrifice is honored.
  I thank the Rotary Club of Orange Park Sunrise for reminding us of 
who we are. Let&#x27;s go get them.

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Wadaag Commons 
Project in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis. ``Wadaag&#x27;&#x27; 
is the Somali word for ``sharing,&#x27;&#x27; and this principle is reflected in 
the design of this building. The project, constructed and owned in 
partnership with the BIPOC and woman-owned developer Nawal Noor, was 
planned and crafted in close collaboration with the community. Getting 
input from those whose lives are most impacted by this development was 
central to the vision that shaped its final form.
  The Wadaag Commons Project is the sixth and final phase of the Seward 
Commons redevelopment effort, which has transformed the neighborhood 
from a desolate industrial park into a high-density, transit-oriented 
housing and commercial area serving diverse incomes. I was proud to 
secure $1.8 million in federal Community Project Funding to help 
facilitate the success of this crucial endeavor.
  Beyond its value to the surrounding community, this project is 
invaluable to those who will call it home. Wadaag Commons provides 
affordable housing to large families and those experiencing 
homelessness. The 39 new units include homes with income-based pricing 
and

[[Page E834]]

Section 8 voucher commitments to address the burden of rising rent. 
Several other units have more than two bedrooms to meet the needs of 
multigenerational households, which has been an option long missing 
from the local housing landscape.
  One of the most notable features of this project is the inclusion of 
indoor and outdoor play areas for children, facilities that are too 
often overlooked in affordable housing developments. Alongside these 
play spaces are private entrances, accessible layouts, and culturally 
relevant design elements all chosen to support daily life, connection, 
and communal care.
  Please join me in recognizing the residents, advocates, and partners 
who made Wadaag Commons possible.

  Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
remarkable group of young men and their coaches from Western Colorado, 
the Grand Mesa Senior All Stars baseball team.
  This summer, these players, ages 14 to 16, won the Colorado Senior 
Little League State Championship in Grand Junction. They went on to 
compete in California for the regional title against some of the best 
teams in the West, proudly representing Colorado with grit and 
determination.
  The team brings together players from across our district, including 
Grand Junction, Clifton, Palisade, Parachute, and Rifle. They first 
captured the district championship and then fought their way through 
the state finals, defeating two tough Denver-area teams to claim back-
to-back state titles--their third in just four years.
  Their success is built not only on talent but also on the dedication 
of their coaches, the support of their families, and the spirit of 
their communities. I am proud of these young men and honored to 
celebrate the Grand Mesa Senior All Stars for the way they represented 
the Western Slope and the State of Colorado.

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize Mr. 
John Moddie on his 100th birthday and to commend him for his valiant 
service with the United States Army as a member of the 590th Field 
Artillery Battalion, 106th Infantry Division during World War II.
  At just 18 years old, while working as a stock clerk at Peterson Boat 
Works in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, Mr. Moddie answered the call to serve 
his country by enlisting in the U.S. Army. Following basic training at 
Camp Roberts, California, he was assigned to B Battery of the 590th 
Field Artillery Battalion, 106th Infantry Division at Camp Atterbury, 
Indiana. Excelling in his training on the 105 mm Howitzer, Mr. Moddie 
set sail for England to prepare for deployment to the Western Front.
  On the morning of November 30, 1944, Mr. Moddie and his battalion 
crossed the English Channel to Le Havre, France, where they awaited 
orders to move up the Seine River into Germany to take part in what 
would become the Battle of the Bulge--the second-most deadly battle of 
the war for American troops. On December 19, 1944, he was captured by 
German forces and held at Stalag 9B in Bad Orb, Germany, as a prisoner 
of war. Despite enduring extreme conditions and losing nearly half his 
body weight, he survived until liberation by Allied forces on April 2, 
1945.
  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Moddie&#x27;s life is a testament to courage, sacrifice, 
and patriotism. Let us honor him for his extraordinary service to our 
Nation, his devotion to his fellow servicemembers, and his steadfast 
commitment to family and community. On behalf of Michigan&#x27;s 1st 
Congressional District, I wish him a joyous 100th birthday and extend 
the gratitude of a Nation, he so bravely served.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF AN HISTORIC ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENT IN 
 THE HISTORY OF THE LOUISIANA HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION (LHSAA)

                                  _____

                              of louisiana

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to humbly honor 
and celebrate the heroic accomplishment of the Saint Augustine High 
School 1975 Football Team, proudly located in Louisiana&#x27;s 2nd 
Congressional District, of which I represent in Louisiana.
  From 1951, its first year as a Catholic high school in New Orleans, 
through the mid-1960s, St. Augustine excelled in three major varsity 
sports: football, basketball and track and field. But the school, 
opened under the administration of New Orleans Archbishop Joseph 
Francis Rummel, was relegated to competing in the Louisiana 
Interscholastic Athletic and Literary Organization (LIALO) during the 
closing era of segregation.
  Its principal, Josephite Father Robert Grant, wanted more for his 
athletes. He wanted them to compete against the city&#x27;s other Catholic 
schools, who were members of the Louisiana High School Athletic 
Association. His first attempt came in 1962 when Father Grant wrote to 
the principals of the five schools--Jesuit, St. Aloysius, Holy Cross, 
De La Salle and Redemptorist--asking them to compete against St. Aug on 
an interscholastic sports level. He thought that would be possible 
because the Archdiocese of New Orleans had already desegregated its 
elementary schools.
  No one accepted the invitation. But there was one reply, by De La 
Salle principal, Christian Brother Cassian. It was painfully blunt: 
``Father, personally, I am not one to rush into situations which may 
not be to my advantage and to those associated with me. For years, I 
have refused to play certain high school teams on the basis that there 
was nothing to gain by such competition. This is how I feel about your 
request to play De La Salle. Time may change my attitude.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Clarence Jupiter, who would go on to become a top administrator 
at Xavier University, championed the cause by asking why St. Augustine 
and Xavier Preparatory, which competed in major boys&#x27; sports, were not 
allowed to play their white Catholic counterparts? These institutions 
developed All-Americans and future pros and perform exceptionally well. 
Yet the fans never saw these schools compete against the other five. On 
the surface, little was happening to change the situation, but Father 
Grant was tirelessly working behind the scenes.
  In June 1964, Fr. Grant notified Archbishop John Cody that he would 
seek admittance to the LHSAA, to establish athletic relations with the 
other Catholic high schools in the archdiocese. He also notified those 
schools of his plan, asking them to include St. Aug on their 
basketball, baseball and track and field schedules for the 1964-65 
school year.
  Father Grant had no delusions that LHSAA Commissioner T.H. ``Muddy&#x27;&#x27; 
Waters would greet his request with open arms. And he was right. Jesuit 
principal Father C.J. Stallworth, who had served on the LHSAA executive 
committee for seven years, said he would do what he could to assist St. 
Augustine, but added it would be helpful to him to have Sister Madalena 
of Xavier Prep also apply for admission to bolster his request.
  Father Grant faced resistance from other Catholic schools, whose 
coaches set the athletic schedules. The Catholic League coaches ignored 
the two LIALO schools when they set the schedules for 1964-65. The CYO 
tournament and Knights of Columbus track meet also kept their events 
segregated.
  At the January 1965 annual meeting, the LHSAA denied St. Augustine&#x27;s 
membership request but amended its constitution to allow LHSAA and 
LIALO schools to compete against each other.
  A year later, Rummel, Shaw and Cor Jesu were admitted by a two-thirds 
vote of LHSAA principals; St. Aug was not. Although the local Catholic 
school principals voted to admit the school into their district by a 5-
3 count, the vote of LHSAA principals numbered 11 yeas, 185 nays. The 
rest is history.
  St. Augustine gained entry through a federal court suit in 1966, the 
CYO allowed St. Augustine and Xavier Prep to compete in its tournament, 
and the Knights of Columbus ceased running its annual track and field 
meet.
  On Friday, December 12, 1975, in Strawberry Stadium. located on the 
campus of Southeastern Louisiana in Hammond, Louisiana, the Saint 
Augustine High School Purple Knights achieved their first state title 
in the Louisiana High School Athletic Association (LHSAA)--the all-
white athletic league that St. Aug integrated through winning a Federal 
Court case in 1967.
  St. Augustine has won state championships in football, basketball and 
track over the years. Xavier Prep became an all-girls school a few 
years after joining the LHSAA.
  The LIALO became a defunct organization in 1969. Its members joined 
the LHSAA. Almost every high school in the LHSAA has a mixed 
enrollment.

                             STATE PLAYOFFS

       George Washington Carver **, 29-8
       West Jefferson **, 14-6
       South Lafourche, 20-7
       Sulphur, 11-10
       Covington, 35-13
       ** First 2 high school games held in the LA Superdome--40k 
     in attendance

  The team&#x27;s historic 15-0 season record not only affirmed St. Aug 
could excel, but it could dominate in the face of adversity. The team&#x27;s 
performance both uplifted the high school and the entire Black 
community in New Orleans and around the state. The team was ranked No. 
1 all season, was first in LHSAA to achieve 15-0 record, and first to 
play in the Louisiana Superdome. For the season, the team outscored 
opponents 409 points to 64 points and held opponents scoreless in 7 
games. That year, eleven (11) team members received football 
scholarships to Division 1 Universities. Currently, over 30 athletes 
have advanced to the National Football League, the largest total than 
any high school in the United States of America.
  Law and Hope are the names of the streets between which St. Augustine 
High School has been located for 74 years. More appropriate symbols 
would be difficult to find as so much of this school speaks of Divine 
Providence. I congratulate the St. Augustine High School Purple 
Knights, the 1975 Championship Football Team, and those that continue 
the mission of the Josephite Fathers and Brothers. Rise Sons of the 
Gold and Purple.

                                  _____
                                 

                         HON. JASMINE CROCKETT

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Ms. CROCKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional 
member of our community, Mr. Robert Phillips, the recipient of D 
Magazine&#x27;s Volunteer of the Year Award.
  For more than two decades, Mr. Phillips has dedicated thousands of 
hours to serving low-income families through the Ferguson Road 
Initiative&#x27;s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program. His 
unwavering commitment to accurate, free tax preparation has made him a 
cornerstone of this vital effort--and a source of immense pride for our 
district.
  As both a tax preparer and site coordinator at two VITA locations, 
Mr. Phillips has helped thousands of individuals and families navigate 
the tax system--even during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when 
many other sites were forced to close. Thanks to his dedication, and 
that of fellow volunteers, the program has completed over 17,900 tax 
returns, returned more than $3.3 million to the community, and saved 
taxpayers an estimated $300,000 in fees.
  Mr. Phillips&#x27; selfless service and steadfast leadership have helped 
ensure financial stability for countless Dallas residents. He has also 
mentored and supported fellow volunteers, strengthening the very fabric 
of our community.
  I am deeply grateful for Robert&#x27;s contributions and proud to 
represent him in Congress. I congratulate him on this well-deserved 
recognition and wish him continued success in all his endeavors.

                          ____________________

                                  _____

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of William 
E. ``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Ballou. Bill was dedicated to sharing the Gospel and will 
be remembered for his love of family and his service to his ``Heavenly 
Father.&#x27;&#x27;
  Bill was born April 8, 1939, in Sterling, Texas, and he later 
attended Baylor University where he met his wife, Avonnell Bolton. God 
blessed Bill and Avonnell with 52 years of marriage--a marriage that 
was focused on Christ and their family of two children, four 
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
  Bill was a devoted Baylor alumni and sought to give back to the 
University that not only gave him an education but also brought 
Avonnell into his life. Bill served as a lifetime member of the Baylor 
Alumni Association, was a former member of the Baylor Development 
Council, and endowed a scholarship in a memory of Avonnell at the 
School of Education.
  Bill will always be remembered for his dedication to sharing the 
message of salvation through Christ. Bill served Christ passionately 
with his lifetime of service in churches in Texas, Mississippi, and 
Georgia. Bill also served in leadership positions in multiple Baptist 
Associations and led revivals as far away as New Zealand.
  One of Bill&#x27;s favorite passages to use when sharing the gospel was 
John 14:6: I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the 
Father except through me.
  Bill left a strong, Godly heritage to those who will walk this Earth 
after him. I am honored to remember his lifetime of service, and I am 
thankful for the incredible family he leaves to carry on his legacy.

     WELCOMING ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 10, 2025

  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to warmly 
welcome the spiritual head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, His All-
Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, to Washington, D.C.
  The longest-serving Archbishop of Constantinople in the history of 
Christianity, the Ecumenical Patriarch will arrive in the United States 
this month to receive the distinguished Templeton Prize. This 
prestigious award will be presented in recognition of his ``pioneering 
efforts to bridge scientific and spiritual understandings of humanity&#x27;s 
relationship with the natural world, bringing together people of 
different faiths to heed a call for stewardship of creation.&#x27;&#x27;
  Guiding the world&#x27;s 300 million Eastern Orthodox Christians since his 
election in 1991, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has been a powerful 
voice for our common responsibilities to one another--our shared 
obligation to defend the freedom, dignity, and wellbeing of our 
neighbors and of future generations.
  I am especially grateful for the impact his leadership has had on 
Orthodox Christians across the United States, particularly the more 
than 600 families at St. Demetrios Church in Weston, Massachusetts. For 
decades, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has had the deepest respect 
of the American people and of this institution--an abiding admiration 
reflected in Congress&#x27; decision to award him the Congressional Gold 
Medal in 1997.
  Today, the Ecumenical Patriarch continues to bring together people of 
all faiths in the pursuit of peace, mutual respect, and a future more 
worthy of our children. I join my colleagues in commending his 
invaluable work, and I proudly join my Orthodox constituents in 
welcoming him back to the United States.

                          ____________________
