I rise today to celebrate David Krug and 
his illustrious career at the City of Buffalos Department of Permits 
and Inspection Services. After a career spanning almost four decades, 
Mr. Krug began his journey four decades ago when he achieved the top 
score on the 1986 Building Inspector Examination. This outstanding 
achievement foreshadowed the next foul decades of an exceptional career 
of service and dedication.
  Throughout his time at the Department, Mr. Krug has provided 
excellent service to the citizens of the City of Buffalo, ensuring each 
project is diligently worked on and completed.
  While Mr. Krug was officially the Coordinator of Plans, his 
benevolence and helpful nature extended far beyond the department. He 
would consistently lend a hand to his coworkers and help them find 
solutions for a myriad of code-related matters. He became the go-to 
person within the office due to his positive approach and willingness 
to help.
  It is difficult to sum up a career of nearly 40 years, but during his 
tenure, Mr. Krug served under nine different commissioners, issued tens 
of thousands of permits, witnessed the construction of countless large-
scale projects, including the HSBC building, and played a pivotal role 
in enhancing the citys landscape through his involvement in 
initiatives such as the Green Code and the implementation of the Hansen 
System.
  Continuing the trend of kindness and cooperation, Mr. Krug has also 
been an active and respected member of the AFSCME Local 650 Union and a 
cherished participant in the

Badge Brothers, fostering camaraderie and unity among his colleagues.
  Today, Mr. Krug is a proud South Buffalo native. His unwavering 
commitment and dedication extends beyond his work, which is evident in 
his role as a devoted husband to the late Teresa Dougherty, proud 
father to Liz and Abbie, and loving grandfather to Addison. His 
children have followed in his footsteps by serving their community as 
firefighters with the Buffalo Fire Department.
  Please join me in congratulating David Krug on a career well spent, 
and wishing him well as he enters this new chapter of his life.
I rise today to honor and celebrate the 
bicentennial of the Town of Ellington, New York. Founded in 1824, 
Ellington has proudly stood the test of time, exemplifying the 
quintessential qualities of small-town America.
  Ellington, nestled in Chautauqua County, was named after Ellington, 
Connecticut, reflecting the origins of many of its early settlers who 
brought with them a pioneering spirit and a commitment to building a 
new life in the burgeoning frontiers of New York State. From its 
inception, Ellington has been characterized by its picturesque 
landscapes, rolling hills, lush forests, and fertile farmland. These 
natural features have shaped the towns identity and continue to be a 
source of pride and beauty for its residents.
  Agriculture has always been the cornerstone of Ellingtons economy. 
The towns long tradition of dairy farming, crop production, and 
livestock rearing has sustained its residents and fostered a deep 
connection to the land. Family-owned farms, some of which have been 
passed down through generations, are a testament to the towns enduring 
agricultural heritage.
  The people of Ellington are the heart and soul of this town. It is a 
close-knit community where tradition, hard work, and neighborly support 
are valued and celebrated. Annual events such as the Ellington Town 
Picnic bring residents together, reinforcing the bonds of friendship 
and community spirit that have always been a hallmark of this town.
  Ellington is home to several historical sites that reflect its rich 
heritage. These include well-preserved homes and buildings from the 
19th century and the Ellington Town Hall, which serves as a hub for 
local government and community events. The preservation of these sites 
is a testament to the towns dedication to honoring its past while 
looking towards the future.
, as we celebrate the bicentennial of Ellington, New York, 
we honor a town that embodies the enduring values of hard work, 
tradition, and community spirit.
I am grateful to recognize 
the 100th birthday of Greg Shorey, a patriot who has been so important 
for families in South Carolina developing the modern two-party system.
  As South Carolina Republican Party Chairman from 1958 to 1961, he was 
a courageous pioneer to launch the modern Republican Party. Beginning 
with the first elected Republican of the Twentieth Century, Charlie 
Boineau was elected to the State House in August 1961, representing 
Richland County.
  Now, Republicans have super majorities in the State House and Senate, 
all statewide officials are Republicans, and eight of nine federal 
officials in the U.S. House of Representatives are Republican.
  Chairman Greg Shorey is a champion for promoting limited government, 
expanded freedom, and peace through strength as hallmarks for 
Republican success.
I rise today to honor the 
Serres Family as they celebrate 100 years of the Serres Ranch. The 
longevity of this great dynasty is a remarkable accomplishment and a 
testament to the Serres familys creativity, tenacity, dedication, and 
commitment to our vibrant agricultural community.
  Serres Ranch was originally owned by Fighting Joe Hooker after the 
Mexican American War and the Bear Flag Revolt. Mr. Hooker sold the 
property to George Watriss from New York. Mr. Watriss moved his family 
onto the land after the purchase in 1857 and partnered with the Serres 
Family. The property was known as the Watriss-Serres Ranch. The 
property was fully acquired by the Serres Family in 1924 establishing 
Serres Ranch.
  In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Serres Ranch cultivated row crops, 
grapevines, and operated a thriving dairy farm. Generations of the 
Serres Family, including John Pierre and John Pierre ``Toots Serres, 
dedicated their lives to nurturing the land and preserving its legacy.
  The entrepreneurial spirit of the Serres family manifested in Serres 
Construction, founded in 1929 by Franklin Watriss Serres and his father 
John Pierre ``Toots Serres. This venture evolved into Serres 
Corporation under the leadership of John Pierre Serres, reflecting the 
familys commitment to innovation and economic growth.
  Today, Serres Ranch stands as a model of sustainable agriculture and 
family stewardship. It is managed by John Pierre Serres and Judy 
Serres, alongside their children John, Buck, and Taylor Serres.
  The legacy continues with the fifth generation overseeing the farming 
of their estates vineyards and creating delicious wines that honor 
their rich family history. Today, the ranch encompasses 200 acres, with 
130 acres dedicated to grapevines, all sustainably grown and climate 
adaptation certified. The diverse enterprises under the Serres Family 
umbrella, including Serres Ranch, Serres Corporation, and Serres Ranch 
Wine, exemplify their dedication to preserving the land and fostering 
community.
, we thank the Serres Family for their dedicated service 
to our community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor them 
as they celebrate their centennial year.

unfortunately, on Friday 
July 19th, 2024, I was otherwise detained due to the nationwide 
CrowdStrike/Microsoft Outage and was unable to deliver the commencement 
address at Southeastern College. The following are the remarks I 
prepared to share with the graduating students:

       Campus President Melissa Jackson, esteemed faculty, members 
     of the class of 2024, family members, and distinguished 
     guests, what an honor it is to be with you today.
       I want to thank President Jackson and Dean Herlene 
     Williams-Ancar for the opportunity to speak to such a 
     remarkable group of men and women.
       In my role as a U.S. Congressman, I serve as a senior 
     Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, 
     as well as a member of the Caucus for Career and Technical 
     Education, so I am especially grateful to be here with you 
     today.
       As a grateful father of four sons, I want to give a special 
     greeting to all the families here today. My wife Roxanne and 
     I have had our fair share of graduations and know firsthand 
     how proud you are of your husbands and wives, sons and 
     daughters, and mothers and fathers. What an exciting time for 
     you.
       We are here today to congratulate and celebrate the more 
     than 70 members of this years graduating class, who have put 
     in countless hours of hard work to reach their goals. What an 
     esteemed group of students you are.
       Your accomplishments speak for themselves, and you deserve 
     recognition for all the hard work you have put in to reach 
     this point. You have sacrificed spending time with your 
     families and given up most of your free time to push yourself 
     and receive the certificate or diploma you are about to be 
     awarded.
       Each of you has a different story as to how you came to 
     this precise moment. Many of you may not have picked up a 
     textbook in years, yet jumped back into becoming a student, 
     all while managing the other aspects of your life. Whether it 
     be working full-time to provide for yourself and your family 
     or trying your best to be a superstar parent or spouse, you 
     were able to juggle all these responsibilities and receive a 
     degree. Just one of these tasks is a job all in its own, so 
     the dedication to your studies should be celebrated and 
     admired. And your commitment to contributing to our workforce 
     is admirable.
       As you well know, Southeastern College is a unique and 
     challenging place to learn. The education you have received 
     in the fields of Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Medical 
     Assisting, Radiologic Technology, Surgical Technology, 
     Cosmetology, and Professional Clinical Massage Therapy have 
     prepared you for a new professional career ahead.
       Because of the knowledge you have obtained during your time 
     here, you are now the best equipped to assist within the 
     profession you have chosen to benefit the lives of your 
     neighbors and community.
       I am sure the hours spent reading quietly alone in a 
     library or surrounded by your noisy family at home have 
     satisfied a thirst you all share for knowledge, and they will 
     serve you as you head on to future endeavors. Your 
     accomplishments have allowed you to be far more knowledgeable 
     and will set you apart from others applying for jobs within 
     your field of choice.
       In a National Teacher Appreciation Day Proclamation in 
     1988, former President Ronald Reagan stated that ``Education 
     is a lifelong process that benefits individuals and entire 
     communities and countries and helps lay the foundation of the 
     future.
       Over the course of your life, you have learned countless 
     lessons, many of which have been obtained through reading a 
     textbook, and others from your personal experiences.

       The need for hard work will always be there and I encourage 
     you to never shy away from a tough challenge. You have shown 
     what you can accomplish when you put your heart and mind to 
     doing something worthwhile. So, each of you should be 
     extremely proud of your accomplishments.
       You have worked hard to receive a wonderful education, so 
     be confident of your abilities and be optimistic as you meet 
     the future head on.
       Our society faces many challenges right now, and politics 
     can seem more divided than ever, but I can tell you from my 
     own experience that there is no greater honor than service to 
     your community.
       I want to thank President Jackson and the faculty again for 
     the honor of being with you today. I want to thank the 
     families and friends for letting me share in the celebration 
     of these graduates. And, of course, I want to thank you, the 
     Class of 2024 for the opportunity to be with you today. I 
     wish you all the best in the years to come. May God Bless.
during the last three 
years, Americans have endured the highest inflation in 40 years, 
costing the average family $13,000 more a year to buy the basics.
  Under President Donald Trump, inflation was 1.4 percent. Since then, 
costs have risen over 20 percent. Families saw prices for Fourth of 
July celebration staples skyrocket:
  Ground beef was up 23 percent
  Sodas up 22 percent
  Hot dogs up 16 percent
  Ice cream also up 16 percent . . . just to name a few.
  House Republicans and Donald Trump are committed to stopping reckless 
spending and restoring fiscal responsibility.
  Corrupt Judge Merchan has unintentionally re-elected Donald Trump and 
removed Biden, clearly earning my invitation to the Trump Inauguration. 
Unethical conduct backfires.
  In conclusion, God Bless Our Troops as the Global War on Terrorism 
continues. We do not need new border laws; we need to enforce existing 
laws. Biden shamefully opens borders for dictators, as more 9/11 
attacks across America are imminent, as repeatedly warned by the FBI.
