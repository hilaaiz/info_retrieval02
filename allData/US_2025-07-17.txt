           CELEBRATING 60 YEARS OF THE CHANNEL ISLANDS HARBOR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JULIA BROWNLEY

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 17, 2025

  Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Channel 
Islands Harbor, which is celebrating 60 years of rich history, vibrant 
community, and natural beauty.
  This beautiful gem in my district is Ventura County&#x27;s first-ever 
recreational harbor, nestled between the cities of Port Hueneme and 
Ventura. Since its grand opening to the public on Memorial Day in 1965, 
the Channel Islands Harbor has helped transform our region into an 
economic engine for both the state and the nation.
  Our ports and harbors are vital for driving economic growth, spurring 
job creation, uplifting small businesses, fostering community 
engagement, generating tourism, protecting coastal ecosystems, and so 
much more.
  Throughout my time in Congress, I have worked closely with local 
leaders and community stakeholders to ensure the harbor remains fully 
operational and accessible. I am proud to have secured millions in 
federal funding to meet the harbor&#x27;s dredging needs, combat coastal 
erosion, and keep the harbor accessible to the commercial fishing 
industry, supply chain businesses, and the general public.
  Thanks to our shared commitment to the dredging and maintenance of 
Channel Islands Harbor, nearly 1,500 harbor vessels. including the 
Channel Islands National Park ferries, commercial fishing vessels, and 
private boaters have safe and unrestricted access between the open 
ocean, Ventura Harbor, and the Ventura Keys.
  For over 60 years, the Channel Islands Harbor has given us 
breathtaking access to our scenic ocean and stunning natural 
landscapes, welcomed tourists to experience the quintessential 
California dream with us, and captured the splendor of California&#x27;s 
26th Congressional District to its fullest--all while strengthening our 
local economy. Today, the Channel Islands Harbor continues to play an 
invaluable role in making Ventura County a wonderful place to live, 
work, and raise a family.
  I am proud to mark the 60th anniversary of the Channel Islands 
Harbor, and I join our community in honoring this iconic local 
landmark.

                          ____________________

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                      HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ

                              of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Chair, my amendment supports the circuit 
rider health program, which Cannon Air Force Base spearheaded to make 
sure military families in rural

[[Page E690]]

communities have access to the specialized care they need. Just like 
the circuit riders of the American frontier who brought church services 
to remote towns, today&#x27;s circuit riders bring child psychiatry, 
neurology, and other critical specialties directly to our bases.
  Cannon may have pioneered this approach, but rural military 
installations across the country could benefit. Nearly 50 percent of 
active-duty bases are in health care deserts, where accessing 
specialists often means long drives, missed duty, and high costs. In 
just over a year, Cannon&#x27;s program served 160 patients, saved $200,000 
in travel voucher costs, and reclaimed 1,400 duty hours.
  The circuit rider program saves money, improves mission readiness, 
and strengthens care for servicemembers and their families.
  I urge support for my amendment to expand this cost-effective and 
proven model to rural bases nationwide.

                                 ______

                        Thursday, July 17, 2025

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and mourn the passing 
of Mr. Donald Dwight of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Mr. Dwight was a 
Marine, newspaper executive, and dedicated public servant. Born in 
Massachusetts, he attended Deerfield Academy and Princeton before 
serving as an active-duty Marine where he earned the rank of captain. A 
man dedicated to his country, Mr. Dwight held multiple public offices, 
including serving as the 64th Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. As 
Lieutenant Governor, he worked behind the scenes to serve his state and 
always stood up for what he felt was right.
  After leaving public office, Mr. Dwight led newspapers in Minneapolis 
and New England

[[Page E686]]

and was responsible for printing seven separate publications. He was 
dedicated to local, independent journalism and never hesitated to 
follow a difficult story.
  Outside of his public life, Mr. Dwight was a loving husband, father, 
and grandfather. To those who knew him, he was endlessly curious, and 
never afraid to try new things. He always knew how to ask the right 
questions and was driven by unflinching dedication to the common good. 
The mark he left on his community, state, and country will never be 
forgotten, and for that, we are forever grateful.

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MELANIE A. STANSBURY

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 17, 2025

  Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gary Allen, who 
just retired as the International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers Western Territory General Vice President and was the 
President of Local Lodge No. 794 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Mr. Allen 
was first initiated into IAM Local Lodge No. 794 in 1979 upon his 
employment at the General Electric Aircraft Engine Plant.
  Following his father Ray&#x27;s example. Mr. Allen involved himself in the 
IAM very early in his career at General Electric by being elected Area 
Steward in 1981. Only one year later, he was elected First Shift 
Steward, and by 1983, he was elected Chief Steward, overseeing the 
activities of all shop stewards on all shifts at General Electric. Mr. 
Allen also served as Local Lodge Auditor, Labor Relations Negotiating 
Committee member, Organizing Committee member, and as a delegate to 
then District Lodge 183.
  In 1985, at the age of 24, Mr. Allen became President and Directing 
Business Representative of Local Lodge 794, representing members at a 
variety of shops including General Electric, Greyhound, Fruehauf 
Trailers, and Arkansas Best Freight. He held this position until 1989, 
when he was appointed Special Representative for the Western Territory.
  In 1991, Mr. Allen became a Grand Lodge Representative, and in 1996, 
he was appointed as the Territorial Organizing Leader for the Western 
Territory, where he coordinated the organizing activities throughout 
the Western Territory. Mr. Allen was then moved to IAM Headquarters in 
1997 as a Coordinator for Collective Bargaining and later that year was 
appointed Aerospace Coordinator in the newly-formed IAM Aerospace 
Department where he coordinated collective bargaining throughout North 
America with aerospace companies such as General Electric, RollsRoyce, 
Pratt &amp; Whitney, Hamilton Sundstrand, and Raytheon among others.
  In 2003, Mr. Allen was appointed to serve as the Western Territory&#x27;s 
Administrative Assistant, where he served in that capacity until 2009, 
when he was elected General Vice President of the Western Territory.
  Since 2012, Mr. Allen has represented the IAM as a trustee on the IAM 
National Pension Fund, the 6th largest multiemployer pension fund in 
the United States with approximately $8.4 billion in assets, providing 
over 80,000 retirees and beneficiaries with retirement security.
  Since 1991, Mr. Allen has also served his community as an Executive 
Board member for the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement 
(LCLAA), becoming a Vice President of the Board in 2010.
  One thing is clear: Mr. Allen has dedicated his life to ensuring his 
fellow union members are treated with the dignity and respect they 
deserve both on and off the jobsite. His decades of knowledge and 
leadership will be missed not just at IAM, but across the union world 
as a whole. I wish him the best in his retirement.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 17, 2025

  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Love Thy City 
event held in Tyler, Texas, a community-wide initiative that reminds us 
that service to our neighbors doesn&#x27;t start in Washington, it starts in 
the heart and in the home as it extends to every corner of this earth.
  Organized by local citizen-leaders, churches, nonprofits, and 
volunteers of all ages, Love Thy City is a day of service to others 
rooted in the great command to love our neighbors. That&#x27;s a principle 
that transcends politics and parties. It transcends race and gender and 
every difference between us. It is our shared responsibility to care 
for everyone around us just as the Good Samaritan did--not because 
Government would tell us to, but because the Love of Christ propels us 
to.
  Whether it&#x27;s cleaning up a park, helping a neighbor in need, or 
simply showing kindness to a stranger, Love Thy City challenges us to 
use our active faith to lead by example and invest in our communities--
not just with words, but with action.
  This is what makes East Texas strong; faith, service, and a deep love 
for God and for one another. I&#x27;m proud to honor this effort today and 
to recognize all those who give their time to love their neighbor.

  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the 20th pastoral anniversary of Reverend Tyrone Nelson, a native of 
Richmond, Virginia, and the esteemed pastor of Sixth Mount Zion Baptist 
Church.
  For two decades, Reverend Nelson has led Sixth Mount Zion with 
vision, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to service. Under his 
leadership, the church has grown not only in membership, but in its 
outreach and impact throughout the Richmond community. He has been a 
steadfast advocate for the needs of his congregation and a champion for 
justice, education, housing, and economic empowerment in the city and 
beyond.
  Reverend Nelson&#x27;s tenure has been marked by a spirit of innovation 
and inclusivity, fostering a welcoming environment for individuals and 
families from all walks of life. His ability to connect faith with 
action has helped shape the church into a community anchor, offering 
programs and partnerships that address food insecurity, youth 
mentorship, and senior care, while serving as a safe gathering place 
for civic dialogue and community advancement.
  In addition to his responsibilities as pastor of Sixth Mount Zion 
Baptist, Reverend Nelson has remained active in civic life, lending his 
voice to advance equity, opportunity, and public service. His 
leadership extends far beyond the pulpit, touching the lives of 
countless community members through both his words and his work.
  Reverend Nelson&#x27;s dedication over the past 20 years is a testament to

  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
Reverend Tyrone Nelson on 20 years of extraordinary service. May his 
leadership continue to inspire, uplift, and strengthen the Richmond 
community for many years to come.

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the life of Mr. 
Samuel Bigler of Millersville Borough, who passed away on July 1, 2025, 
at the age of 78.
  Mr. Samuel Bigler, known as Sam, was a father to Evan and a husband 
to Cindy. He was a strong presence in the Lancaster community as a 
veteran, an Olympic weightlifter, a teacher, a business owner, a 
volunteer, and much more.
  A 1965 graduate of Co]umbia High School, Sam enlisted in the U.S. 
Army and served between 1966 and 1969. Having lifted weights since a 
young age, Sam continued this passion and won numerous national and 
international titles and awards, culminating in a spot on the 1976 U.S. 
Olympic Weightlifting team in Montreal, Canada and a tenth-place 
finish.
  Sam attended Millersville State College and received a bachelor&#x27;s and 
master&#x27;s degree in education. He then served as a reading specialist at 
Thaddeus Stevens College for 33 years. During this time, Sam began a 
rental property business with his wife, Cindy.
  Sam was also impactful in his volunteer capacity. He served on the 
Millersville Zoning Board, the local Republican committee, and was a 
mentor to individuals participating in the Lancaster County Veteran&#x27;s 
Court program.
  Sam&#x27;s impact on the community cannot be understated, and I am glad to 
have known him. As we celebrate the life of Sam Bigler, we offer our 
prayers of comfort to his family during this time.

                        Thursday, July 17, 2025

  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of 
Corporal Edmund ``Ed&#x27;&#x27; Burke of Wilton, Connecticut who will celebrate 
his 100th birthday next week.
  Born and raised in the Bronx, he attended Fordham Prep High School 
and was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1944. Just eighteen at the time, 
Corporal Burke reported for basic training at Camp Wheeler, Georgia 
without hesitation, knowing his call to serve came when his country 
needed him most.
  Assigned to the Seventh Armored Division, he was an Infantry Machine 
Gunner in the European theatre of World War II. He saw action at the 
Battle of the Bulge, where his division took over 100,000 German 
prisoners, with Corporal Burke personally capturing enemy soldiers. His 
bravery earned him multiple commendations, including: a Bronze Star, 
the Purple Heart, ETO ribbon with four battle stars, Presidential Unit 
Citation, Meritorious Unit Citation, Belgian Fourregiare, and the 
Combat Infantry Badge.
  After receiving an honorable discharge in 1946, Corporal Burke 
pursued engineering degrees on the G.I. Bill, first at Manhattan 
College where he earned his Bachelor of Civil Engineering, later at 
Columbia University, where he completed his Masters in the same field. 
Throughout his tenure as an engineer, Corporal Burke would join the New 
York State Department of Public Works, as well as Corbett, Tinghir &amp; 
Co. Engineers, ending his career as a partner at Moran, Proctor, 
Mueser, and Rutledge. There, he was renowned for meticulously and 
thoughtfully applying his expertise in foundational engineering to the 
projects on which he worked, including over one hundred sites right 
here in Washington, D.C.
  Corporal Burke&#x27;s life stands as an all-American success story, one 
which we would all do well to share with our constituents as a model of 
how service, hard work, and patriotism come together to form a life 
well-led. On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I 
would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Ed Burke for his service, 
our congratulations on reaching this milestone in a full life, and a 
sincere happy birthday. May this be his best one yet.

  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of the CLARITY Act 
and voted YEA when it was marked up in the House Financial Services 
Committee. I would have voted YEA on this bill, which will foster 
investment and job creation in the rapidly growing digital economy. Had 
I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 199, passage of 
H.R. 3633.

   RECOGNIZING SETH HERNANDEZ, BILLY CARLSON, BRADY EBEL, AND ETHIN 
                                BINGAMAN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEN CALVERT

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 17, 2025

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of four 
Corona High School students, Seth Hernandez, Billy Carlson, Brady Ebel, 
and Ethin Bingaman who were selected in the 2025 Major League Baseball 
Draft. Seth Hernandez, Billy Carlson, and Brady Ebel were selected in 
the First Round on Sunday, and Ethin Bingaman was selected in the 
Twentieth Round on Monday. This is the first time in Major League 
Baseball Draft history that three players from the same high school 
were drafted in the first round. I am always proud to calI myself an 
alumnus of Corona High School, but I am especially proud this week.
  Corona High School has a long history of excellence on the baseball 
diamond. Seth, Billy, Brady, and Ethin are the latest in a long line of 
Corona High School players who have made their way to Major League 
Baseball. The Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, 
and Arizona Diamondbacks are all incredibly lucky to draft Seth, Billy, 
Brady, and Ethin, respectively, and I know they will represent the 
school and our community well. I wish them all the best in the next 
step of their journey, and along with all Corona residents and Corona 
High School alumni, I look forward to cheering them on in the Major 
League.
