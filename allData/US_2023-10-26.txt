  CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILITARY WORKING DOG TEAMS 
                           NATIONAL MONUMENT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 10th 
anniversary of the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument located 
at Joint Base San Antonio--Lackland.
  For the past ten years, the Military Working Dog Teams National 
Monument has served as a physical symbol of the loyal service and 
unconditional sacrifice that military working dogs have made alongside 
our men and women in uniform since WWII.
  It is a privilege and an honor to celebrate the anniversary of the 
Military Working Dog Teams National Monument. I hope this record serves 
as an acknowledgment of the immeasurable debt of gratitude owed to both 
soldiers and K-9s by the American people. On behalf of Texas&#x27; 21st 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
the extraordinary sacrifice of these individuals and animals.

                          ____________________

 CELEBRATING THE LAS VEGAS ACES FOR WINNING THE 2023 WOMEN&#x27;S NATIONAL 
                  BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate 
the Las Vegas Aces on winning the 2023 Women&#x27;s National Basketball 
Association Finals.
  On October 18, 2023, the Las Vegas Aces defeated the New York 
Liberty, 70-69, in Game 4 of the WNBA Finals. The Aces won the 
championship three games to one and became the first professional team 
in Nevada to win two championships. They won despite two of their 
starters being out with injuries, star guard Chelsea Gray and center 
Kiah Stokes.
  They also became the first WNBA team in 21 years to win consecutive 
championships.
  Hall of Fame head coach Becky Hammon led the team to victory and 
became the third coach in either the NBA or WNBA to win two 
championships in her first two seasons.
  Even before the playoffs, the Aces had an incredible season, 
clinching first seed in the playoffs after dominating the regular 
season with a record of 34-6. They set a new league record for wins and 
led the league in points per game and field goal percentage.
  At home, the Aces went 19-1 in the regular season and undefeated in 
the postseason, setting attendance records and even hosting the All-
Star Game.
  Owner Mark Davis and Team President Nikki Fargas proved once again 
that investing in women&#x27;s sports is investing in success, thereby 
setting an example for others to follow.
  In the championship-clinching game, Finals Most Valuable Player A&#x27;ja 
Wilson led the way with 24 points and 16 rebounds, while Jackie Young 
added 16 points and seven assists. And Kelsey Plum delivered a well-
rounded performance of eight rebounds, five assists, and seven points. 
The Aces never trailed in the fourth quarter.
  The Aces certainly raised the stakes when securing another 
championship for Vegas, firmly establishing District One as the Sports 
Capital of the World.
  All of Southern Nevada is very proud and I can&#x27;t wait to cheer the 
team on next year as they go for three in a row.

             CELEBRATING THE LEGACY OF MAYOR KEN MARSHBURN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. WILEY NICKEL

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor and celebrate the 
exemplary service of Mayor Ken Marshburn, a distinguished leader, and 
devoted public servant to the Town of Garner. I&#x27;m privileged to 
recognize his remarkable contributions to our community and express our 
collective gratitude.
  Before Ken Marshburn was elected as Garner&#x27;s mayor in 2019, he served 
on the Town Council for twelve years. He was also on the board of the 
Garner Economic Development Corporation, which led the redevelopment of

[[Page E1022]]

the former ConAgra site into a bustling Amazon fulfillment center, 
further solidifying Garner&#x27;s role in the economic prosperity of our 
region.
  Beyond his civic leadership, Mayor Marshburn has exhibited a life of 
dedication to public service, retiring as the Chief of U.S. Pretrial 
Services for the Eastern District of North Carolina, after a laudable 
26-year career. He and his wife, the equally esteemed Ms. Faye 
Marshburn, who served the Wake County Public School System, have been 
pillars of the Garner community for over three decades.
  It&#x27;s impossible to miss the philanthropic spirit of the Marshburns. 
Both Mayor Marshburn and Mrs. Marshburn have been steadfast volunteers 
with Meals on Wheels of Wake County as well as active members of Garner 
First Baptist Church.
  Furthermore, Mayor Marshburn&#x27;s passion for education and youth 
empowerment is evident from his fourteen-year service as guardian ad 
litem for Wake County, his fifteen-year tenure as a reading tutor in 
Garner schools, and his unwavering commitment to the Garner Morning 
Rotary Club for nearly two decades.
  Mayor Marshburn&#x27;s leadership has steered Garner towards a positive 
and prosperous future. His commitment to fiscal responsibility has laid 
a solid foundation for the town&#x27;s growth, attractIng new businesses 
that enrich our economic diversity. His legacy is one of leadership, 
service, and unwavering dedication to our community.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Mayor Ken Marshburn for 
his unwavering commitment and invaluable contributions to Garner and 
extending our best wishes to him and his family as they embark on this 
well-deserved retirement.
  Our community is undeniably richer and brighter due to his leadership 
and service.

                                 ______

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on October 29, 2023, the Republic of Turkiye 
celebrates the 100th anniversary of its founding, and I congratulate 
the People of Turkiye and Turkish Americans on this 100th 
commemoration.
  As a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on U.S.-Turkiye Relations 
and Turkish Americans and the only Member of Congress of Turkish 
descent, I recognize the vast reforms that were undertaken by Mustafa 
Kemal Ataturk and his vision for a reformed, modernized, and democratic 
Turkish Republic. Today, Turkish Americans represent a vital thread of 
the American fabric, and with rich culture and history, they serve as 
the best ambassadors for strong relations between our two countries.
  I take pride in the contributions and cultural richness brought by 
Turkish-Americans to the United States. Our heritage is a tapestry 
woven into the diverse fabric of this nation, and we remain committed 
to fostering understanding and collaboration between Turkiye and the 
United States.
  I congratulate the Turkish people and Turkish Americans on this 
centennial milestone and look forward to strengthening U.S. Turkiye 
relations.

 HONORING FABIAN ALOMAR AS 2023 VALLEY LUCHADOR FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE 
                                 MONTH

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Fabian Aiomar as a 
Valley Luchador.
  Fabian is a professional skateboarder and actor. He stated his career 
in the `90s, and since then he has involved himself in community 
advocacy. He most recently appeared in FLAMIN&#x27; HOT, an ode to the 
invention of Hot Cheetos--a beloved snack.
  A former resident of Panorama City, Fabian balances acting with his 
love for skateboarding. He supports the sport and kids interested in it 
by donating skateboards so they can get involved in and improve at 
skateboarding.
  Over four years ago, Fabian became involved with the Anti-Recidivism 
Coalition as a formerly incarcerated individual. The ARC empowers 
formerly and currently incarcerated people to thrive by providing a 
support network, comprehensive reentry services, and opportunities to 
advocate for policy changes that will help others caught in cycles of 
incarceration.
  Today, Fabian uses his platform to share the mission of ARC to help 
others who are formerly incarcerated integrate back into society.
  Fabian, like me, is the son of immigrants and came from a lineage of 
farmers.
  He told one of our local newspapers, the San Fernando Sun, that he 
recently reconnected with his campesino roots and is expanding his 
advocacy efforts to include agricultural workers.
  His advocacy, energy, and compassion are limitless, and we are proud 
to call him a Valley native.
  I thank Fabian. It is my honor to recognize him as a distinguished 
leader and luchador during Hispanic Heritage Month.

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize an incredible 
friend and community leader, Samantha Woll. Our community is deeply 
saddened by her tragic death and the sudden loss of a courageous and 
tenacious fighter for all.
  I first met Samantha, affectionately known as Sam, in 2016. Sam was 
driven by her Jewish faith that led to her interfaith work. Sam had the 
ability to connect with diverse communities and bring people together 
in a way that made us all stronger. Her lasting impact is a testament 
to her strong values and character.
  Not only did she serve as the President of the Isaac Agree Detroit 
Downtown Synagogue where she worked tirelessly in preparation of its 
recent re-opening, Sam also served with numerous community 
organizations, including serving on the board of the Mary Turner Center 
for Advocacy. Through her work, Sam created spaces for both Muslim and 
Jewish youth together. Sam served on a number of Democratic campaigns 
and volunteered for many political causes, helping support local, state 
and national issues.
  Above all, Sam was a daughter, sister and aunt who absolutely adored 
her family. If she wasn&#x27;t actively organizing her community, she was 
spending most of her time with family and traveling. Sam was our beacon 
of hope and a light for many.
  Samantha Woll&#x27;s infectious spirit, warmth, and friendship will be 
sorely missed. Please join me in recognition of Samantha Woll&#x27;s life 
and legacy. May her memory be a blessing.

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the recognition 
by the Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives of the North 
Central Massachusetts Chamber of Commerce as the 2023 Chamber of the 
Year. I am so proud that the North Central Chamber of Commerce is the 
first Chamber of Commerce in Massachusetts and New England to be 
recognized with this prestigious national honor. The Chamber will be 
celebrating this success at their Congressional Luncheon on November 1, 
2023. Congresswoman Lori Trahan and I will jointly celebrate this 
monumental achievement.
  The North Central Chamber demonstrates excellence in operations, 
member services, and community leadership. The Chamber provides 
immeasurable support to budding and established entrepreneurs in the 
region, which helps our businesses thrive. From new programs supporting 
Latinx small business, to revamping highly trafficked tourism 
destinations, the Chamber tirelessly works to improve the life of 
residents and guests to Central Massachusetts.
  This recognition affirms what my constituents already know: the North 
Central Chamber of Commerce goes above and beyond for all. The 
Chamber&#x27;s commitment to continued improvement is what makes them so 
successful.
  And, of course, Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the countless 
partners that help the Chamber excel at their work. North Central 
Massachusetts&#x27;s educational, economic, non-profit, cultural, and 
governmental organizations each have seamlessly integrated into the 
Chamber&#x27;s purview. The over 700 businesses and organizations the 
Chamber assists rightly trust the Chamber to help them serve the 
twenty-seven communities across North Central Massachusetts.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate the remarkable contributions of 
the North Central Massachusetts Chamber of Commerce. Congratulations to 
such a great organization for another year of phenomenal work.

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of 
Mr. Victor Garza. He is a longtime community advocate and Latino leader 
in San Jose, CA.
  Victor Garza was born in Eagle Pass, Texas, and moved to California 
in 1960. He enlisted in the United States Navy and when he left the 
Navy, he realized there were limited services for veterans in the 
community. He observed that Latinos were struggling to gain a political 
voice and recognized that two key areas that needed to be addressed 
were educational attainment of Latinos and increasing their political 
participation and increasing services to people in need throughout the 
community. He was active in one of the most important veterans&#x27; groups 
in the nation, the American GI Forum.
  Victor became the first Manager of the Santa Clara County Office of 
Veterans Services. He has received numerous commendations and awards 
for his long history of political activism and community involvement 
including proclamations from the U.S. Congress, State Legislature, 
County of Santa Clara. and the City of San Jose. He was awarded 
``Outstanding Young Man of America&#x27;&#x27; by the U.S. Jaycees, recognized by 
the Santa Clara County Human Relations Commission for outstanding 
service and dedication to the community, and was an Olympic Cross 
Country Torch Relay Participant in 1996. The Victor Garza Community 
Center in Austin, Texas bears his name, as does the Victor Garza 
Educational Center at Evergreen Valley College.
  He founded the La Raza Roundtable in 1988, Santa Clara County&#x27;s 
largest coalition of Latino and Mexican American organizations, and 
spent the last 4 decades fighting for his community. In 1998, Victor 
was invited by the White House to participate in President Clinton&#x27;s 
Initiative on Race and Poverty.
  Victor has been a strong voice for equitable education, social and 
health services, immigration issues, employment and promotional issues 
that impact the Latino workforce, as well as veterans affairs. He is 
truly the best our community has to offer, and it has been my privilege 
to work alongside him and I am proud to call him my friend.

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Xiomara Flores-
Holguin as a Valley Luchadora.
  Xiomara is famous in Los Angeles County for her work as a social 
worker and protecting thousands of kids during her amazing career.
  She grew up a child of immigrants from Nicaragua. As a first 
generation American whose first language was Spanish, Xiomara has 
always understood the importance of inclusion, representation, and 
protecting those without a voice.
  She received her master&#x27;s degree in social work from the University 
of Southern California and got her start working with the Los Angeles 
County Department of Children and Family Services.
  During her time posted with the Emergency Response Command, there 
were many nights when she was the only Spanish-speaking social worker 
in the entire county available to respond to emergency calls to 
accompany law enforcement to homes where Spanish-speaking children 
needed care.
  When LAPD units answered calls about gang violence, Xiomara was 
there. When LAPD busted a human trafficking ring, Xiomara was there. 
When they raided a house where drugs were being manufactured, Xiomara 
was there.
  Her primary concern was always the innocent children caught up in the 
violence, usually standing to the side, quiet and frightened while 
police arrested the adults around them. She made sure they were cared 
for and reunited with family whenever possible or placed into the 
foster system.
  Xiomara retired after 36 years with the Department of Children and 
Family Services. She leaves behind a legacy of new policies that 
protect the welfare of vulnerable children throughout Los Angeles.
  She continues to give back to her community by way of teaching part-
time at the California State University Northridge Department of Social 
Work. Xiomara understands the need for compassion and trained, 
culturally competent crisis professionals to respond to urgent calls, 
values she passes on to her students.
  In addition to her work at CSUN, she remains a tireless worker and 
advocate for underserved populations and is a major influencing member 
of the San Fernando Valley Coalition on Gangs.
  I thank Xiomara. It is my honor to recognize her as a distinguished 
community leader and luchadora during this Hispanic Heritage Month.

every California Democrat and the entire Nevada delegation renaming the 
Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-506) in honor of the 
late U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). We recognize her legacy and 
leadership spanning more than three decades to Keep Tahoe Blue.
  Among her many accomplishments, Senator Feinstein secured more than 
$715 million in authorized federal funding under this landmark 2000 law 
to conserve Lake Tahoe and the surrounding basin for future 
generations. Senator Feinstein&#x27;s 2016 amendments to this law provided 
new authorities for the U.S. Forest Service to combat wildfires across 
the Tahoe Basin. These authorities were first employed in combating the 
devastating Caldor Fire in 2021 and in the recovery since.
  Nobody in government has done more to Keep Tahoe Blue than Senator 
Feinstein. She organized the first annual Tahoe Summit in 1997, while I 
served as Deputy Secretary of the Interior during the Clinton 
Administration. The California and Nevada Senators have since rotated 
hosting the Tahoe Summit annually, which I have been honored to attend 
over the years.
  In 1999, Senator Feinstein sponsored the original Lake Tahoe 
Restoration Act, the companion of which by then-Congressman John T. 
Doolittle (R-CA) was enacted into law in the year 2000. In the 114th 
Congress, I was honored to sponsor the companion to Senator Feinstein&#x27;s 
``Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2015&#x27;&#x27; with then-U.S. Senator Dean 
Heller (R-NV), which was enacted into law the following year.
  Under the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (Division AA of 
Public Law 116-260), she worked with Congresswoman Dina Titus (D-NV), 
U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA), and me to authorize the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers new invasive species in alpine lakes pilot project 
to safeguard Lake Tahoe. Under the Water Resources Development Act of 
2022 (Title LXXXI of Public Law 117-263), she worked again with us to 
secure an additional $25 million in federal funding for restoration 
efforts across the Lake Tahoe Basin, such as restoration of the Upper 
Truckee River and Marsh.
  This past March, Senator Feinstein sponsored the ``Lake Tahoe 
Restoration Reauthorization Act of 2023&#x27;&#x27; with the entire Nevada 
delegation to provide an additional $415 million in federal funding 
until 2034. I can think of no better tribute to Senator Feinstein&#x27;s 
decades of leadership to help conserve Lake Tahoe than passing this 
bipartisan reauthorization into law. I am deeply saddened by the 
passing of this amazing public servant, longtime friend, and treasured 
colleague. Senator Feinstein will be missed dearly, but her legacy will 
endure through the lives of the countless Californians she improved 
during her storied life and career.
  My colleagues and I from the California and Nevada delegations are 
honored to recognize Senator Feinstein&#x27;s tireless advocacy for our 
public lands by sponsoring this bill to rename the landmark Lake Tahoe 
Restoration Act in her honor. Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members to 
join us in cosponsoring this bill.

                          ____________________

           RECOGNIZING BOB GATT&#x27;S SERVICE TO THE CITY OF NOVI

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bob Gatt, Mayor 
of Novi, Michigan, on the occasion of his retirement. His decades

[[Page E1025]]

of tireless service to the city of Novi are worthy of commendation.
  Born and raised in Detroit, it was a childhood dream of Bob&#x27;s to 
become a police officer. When looking for a position, Bob was saddened 
to find that most police departments at that time had a height 
requirement. Luckily for Bob and for Novi, the Novi Police Department 
had no such requirement. Bob began his service to the City of Novi as a 
police officer in 1975.
  Soon after starting the job, Bob learned about the Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education (DARE) program. After attending a two-week course 
and becoming a DARE Officer, Bob launched the DARE program here in 
Novi. To this day, Bob teaches DARE to the children of Novi. Bob&#x27;s 
leadership within the department led him to be promoted to the role of 
Detective, later earning the rank of Seargent shortly before his 
retirement in 2002.
  After spending some time on Novi&#x27;s Zoning Board of Appeals, Bob 
decided to run for City Council, a seat he would hold for the next 8 
years. In 2011, Bob took the next step and was elected Mayor of the 
City of Novi. His 12 years at the helm has led Novi to reduce its debt 
by 75 percent and cut its crime rate in half. Novi has received 
national recognition for their support of small businesses, community 
schools, and technology innovation. In 2022, Fortune Magazine ranked 
Novi in the Top Ten Best Places to Live for Families in the United 
States.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Bob 
Gatt and the 48 years of service he has given to the residents of Novi. 
While he is retiring from local politics, service runs in his blood, 
and Bob plans to continue as the Manager of the Oakland County Animal 
Shelter. We thank Bob for his tremendous service and wish him some 
much-deserved tranquility in this next chapter of life. I thank Bob.

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
exceptional service of Mrs. Penny Hartsfield White, 4th Episcopal

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  Under Episcopal Supervisor Penny Hartsfield White&#x27;s leadership, the 
members of the Women&#x27;s Missionary Society have grown in their mission 
focus. Episcopal Supervisor Penny is intentional about ensuring the 
missionaries bless organizations that serve ``the least of these.&#x27;&#x27; 
Donations of diapers, clothing, socks, coats, toiletries, toys, and 
funds are just a sampling of the ways the missionaries have an impact.
  Penny&#x27;s service to her community is rich and extensive, including 
serving: with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Miami; as Chair and 
Co-Chair of United Way Campaigns: as a Co-Chair for multiple March of 
Dimes sub-committees; on Committees within the American Cancer Society; 
as Treasurer for the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce Trustee Council; 
with the Chamber as they travelled to Brazil and South Africa to foster 
working relationships between countries; and as an officer of the Fort 
Lauderdale Chapter of The Links, Incorporated. Penny currently serves 
as a Board Member of the Black Women&#x27;s Agenda, Inc.
  During her tenure, Episcopal Supervisor Penny Hartsfield White 
spearheaded the project to build a home for a pastor in Africa when she 
learned he needed a place to live. She led the construction of a 
commercial kitchen in the public library in Pembroke, Illinois, to 
ensure the community had a suitable gathering place. She also 
coordinated the purchase of sewing machines for widowed women in India 
so they could make items to sell to support their families.
  I join with members of the 4th Episcopal District of the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church and the global community to thank Mrs. Penny 
Hartsfield White for her exceptional service to the church and our 
nation. I wish her health and happiness in her weIl-deserved 
retirement.

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize 
the life of Camille Brandon, a dedicated public servant and advocate 
for causes about which she cared deeply. Those of us who are fortunate 
enough to have worked with her will recall the kindness, the decency 
and the warmth that she brought to all of her governmental, political 
and civic efforts.
  Camille was the Deputy Erie County Clerk under elected clerks of both 
major parties, was a trusted advisor in the administration of

[[Page E1024]]

Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski and held important positions at the 
Buffalo City Court. She was the Vice President of the Pulaski 
Association, chaired the Youth Services and Citizens Police Advisory 
Boards in the Town of Cheektowaga, and sat on the board of the YWCA 
Institute for Public Leadership Planning. She was an American Heart 
Association board member and had been Grand Marshall of Buffalo&#x27;s 
Pulaski Day Parade.
  Active in politics, she was a delegate to the Democratic National 
Convention in 1992, 1996, and 2012. She generously lent her time, her 
expertise, and her friendly and positive attitude to political efforts.
  We join our friend, Camille&#x27;s dedicated husband, Bob Brandon, in 
mourning this tremendous loss. All of us who knew and worked with 
Camille will remember her with deep gratitude and affection. If more 
people in the realms of politics, government and civic affairs shared 
Camille&#x27;s deep commitment to kindness, decency and mutual 
understanding, our nation would be far better off. May she continue to 
be an example to all of us.

                TRIBUTE TO MRS. MARY ELLEN RIVERS SMITH

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 26, 2023

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a committed 
educator, devout Christian, and dedicated public servant, Mrs. Mary 
Ellen Rivers Smith. Ms. Smith transitioned from this life on October 
14, 2023. She was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 13, 
1931, the third of four children born to Addell and Mitchell Rivers.
  Ms. Smith was a proud graduate of the Charleston School System, 
having attended Simonton Elementary School, where I began my 
professional career, and the historic Avery Institute, the first 
accredited secondary school for African Americans in Charleston. The 
Avery Institute had a special place in her heart. Decades after 
graduation, Mrs. Smith donated several artifacts from her school days 
to what has become the Avery Research Center for African American 
History and Culture.
  Ms. Smith matriculated at North Carolina Central University, then 
North Carolina College, in Durham, North Carolina, in 1952 and 
graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Health and Physical 
Education with a minor in Education. An avid and talented singer, Mrs. 
Smith earned the nickname ``Songbird&#x27;&#x27; as a soloist in the University 
Choir. After graduation, she returned to Charleston to teach high 
school and shortly thereafter married Reverend Dr. Charles F. Thomas.
  Mrs. Smith was deeply dedicated to uplifting and shaping young minds. 
Over her six-decades-long career as an educator, she taught in 
elementary and middle schools in South Carolina; Biloxi, Mississippi; 
Lanon, Philippine Islands; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Omaha, Nebraska. 
After residing in Omaha for many years, she moved with her family to 
Huntsville, Alabama.
  In Huntsville, Mrs. Smith became Education Director for the 
Comprehensive Childcare program. She retired from teaching in 1999 but 
continued her commitment to educating the next generation of young 
minds as a substitute elementary school teacher. Additionally, during 
this time, she met and married Frank C. Smith of Charleston. Her 
dedication to education and community service served as an inspiration 
to her five children, all of whom served as educators in various 
capacities.
  Mrs. Smith accepted Christ as her Lord and Savior at a young age and 
was baptized at Calvary Baptist Church. Her love for the Lord would 
follow her throughout the entirety of her life. A longtime devoted 
parishioner of Morris Street Baptist Church in Charleston, Mrs. Smith 
was involved in the Senior Choir, Hour of Power Choir, Educational 
Ministry, Newsletter Ministry, Social Butterflies, Senior Ministry, 
Pastoral Aid, Senior Citizens, and Sunday School.
  After relocating to the Washington, D.C. area to live with her 
daughter Jennifer, Mrs. Smith became a member of the Reid Temple AME 
Church. There, she participated in the Reid Temple Senior Services 
Bible study. However, Morris Street Baptist always remained dear to her 
heart.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in honoring 
the remarkable life of Mrs. Mary Ellen Rivers Smith. She is remembered 
fondly by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchild, beloved 
relatives, church family, and dear friends. Mrs. Smith lived a life 
full of love, devotion, public service, and grace. She will be sorely 
missed and well-remembered by all blessed to know her.
