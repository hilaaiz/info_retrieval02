           CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR. JAMES WEST

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. WILEY NICKEL

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 29, 2023

  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor the 
life and legacy of a true champion of the people, Dr. James West, a 
revered Wake County Commissioner and a beacon of hope for many in our 
community. It&#x27;s with deep sorrow that we mark his passing, but with 
immense gratitude that we celebrate his legacy.
  Dr. James West dedicated his life to public service, always striving 
to uplift those in need. From his early days as a college student in 
the 1960s, peacefully protesting segregation in Greensboro alongside 
Jesse Jackson, to his extensive service as a Raleigh City Councilman 
and Wake County Commissioner, his journey was marked by a relentless 
commitment to justice and equality.
  His academic achievements, including a doctorate in education, and a 
three-decade-long career at the North Carolina Cooperative Extension 
Service at NC State University laid the foundation for his deep 
understanding of the issues facing our community. Dr. West was proud to 
be the first black person in the U.S. to become Director of County 
Operations for the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service, with 
the responsibility of supervising over 1,000 faculty and staff members.
  Dr. West&#x27;s tenure on the Raleigh City Council, including his time as 
Mayor Pro Tem, was characterized by his visionary leadership and his 
ability to forge meaningful partnerships. His work with the Southeast 
Raleigh Alliance, which he co-founded, exemplified his commitment to 
economic empowerment and community development.
  In his role as a County Commissioner, Dr. West was instrumental in 
the creation of the Live Well Wake initiative, aimed at enhancing the 
health and wellbeing of the community. His efforts to expand affordable 
housing and his leadership in the Health and Human Services Committee 
highlight his holistic approach to public service and his belief that 
every individual deserves dignity and stability.
  Dr. West&#x27;s legacy is not just in the programs he initiated or the 
policies he championed, but in the countless lives he touched, the 
community leaders he inspired, and the unquantifiable impact of his 
compassion and leadership.
  We remember Dr. West for his ``Dr. West-isms,&#x27;&#x27; his wisdom, and his 
unwavering faith in the power of community. He taught us the importance 
of strengthening our ``spiritual infrastructure,&#x27;&#x27; and he believed 
deeply in the potential of every individual.
  As we mourn Dr. James West&#x27;s passing, we also celebrate his 
extraordinary life--a life dedicated to service, equality, and the 
betterment of Wake County and its people. My thoughts are with his 
family, friends, and all those who were fortunate enough to know him.

                          ____________________

  HONORING THE 26TH ANNIVERSARY PASSING OF FORMER MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SHRI THANEDAR

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 29, 2023

  Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the 
longest serving mayor of the city I so proudly represent, Mayor Coleman 
A. Young, on the 26th anniversary of his passing.
  Born in the throes of segregation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Mayor Young 
rose from the humble beginnings of the Great Migration to become a 
beacon of hope and a pillar of strength for the city of Detroit. His 
journey was marked not just by the offices he held, but by the 
indomitable spirit he embodied--a spirit that challenged inequality, 
fought for justice, and tirelessly sought to uplift every resident of 
Detroit.
  As Detroit&#x27;s first African-American mayor, he broke barriers and 
built bridges. He led our city through times of challenge and change, 
always with an unwavering vision for a more inclusive and prosperous 
Detroit. His efforts to integrate the Detroit Police Department and to 
fight excessive use of force were not just administrative actions, but 
bold steps towards healing and unity. His advocacy for affirmative 
action and his dedication to economic development were testament to his 
belief in a Detroit that offered opportunity for all. Under his 
leadership, Detroit saw the rise of vital infrastructure and community 
projects, laying the groundwork for the city&#x27;s future.
  As we reflect on Mayor Young&#x27;s legacy, let us remember his courage, 
his unwavering commitment to civil rights, and his enduring love for 
Detroit. His life&#x27;s work reminds us of the power of resilience, the 
importance of visionary leadership, and the unyielding pursuit of 
equality. Mayor Young&#x27;s legacy is not confined to the past; it is a 
guiding light for our future, motivating us to continue building a city

[[Page E1140]]

that is as strong, as vibrant, and as inclusive as the remarkable 
leader we commemorate today. May his memory continue to inspire us all.

                                 ______

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 29, 2023

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lauren 
Noyes for her distinguished career and service in our Nation&#x27;s Capital.
  Lauren has dedicated her life to advancing good public policy and the 
betterment of those who serve on Capitol Hill.
  A native of New Brunswick, New Jersey, Lauren grew up in Virginia, 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Iowa, and Florida. After graduating Magna Cum 
Laude from Wake Forest with a B.A. in English, Lauren moved to 
Washington, D.C. Like many congressional staffers, she started as a 
Staff Assistant in the Office of Rep. John Shadegg (AZ-4), where she 
was quickly promoted to Legislative Assistant. Then. in 1997, she 
joined the Office of Rep. Joe Pitts (PA-16), becoming his Legislative 
Director in 1998. During her time with Rep. Pitts, Lauren helped 
establish the Values Action Team (VAT).
  One of the most meaningful aspects of her time on Capitol Hill was 
participating in Faith and Law--an organization founded in 1983 that 
encourages and equips Christian policymakers to more fully understand 
the Biblical worldview and its implication for their calling to public 
service.
  In 2001, Lauren left Capitol Hill and continued her distinguished 
career at The Heritage Foundation, where she served in multiple roles 
until 2008. For the next nine years Lauren dedicated herself to raising 
her four children with her husband, Brad.
  Lauren returned to Capitol Hill as Faith and Law&#x27;s new Executive 
Director in 2017. Through her six years at its helm, Lauren has made an 
indelible mark on the organization and countless staffers in both the 
House and the Senate--and both Democrat and Republican. Lauren led 
Faith and Law into a new era, ushering the organization into a season 
of rapid growth. The programs she has built now inform and mentor those 
who work on Capitol Hill from interns to senior staff members.
  From Friday Forums, regularly attended by nearly a hundred staffers, 
to reading groups and mentorship programs, Faith and Law&#x27;s reputation 
as a source of guidance and community for Hill staffers continues to 
grow--and that is due in large part to Lauren&#x27;s leadership. In 2021, 
Lauren launched the Capitol Hill Moms Group to encourage and equip 
working mothers.
  Providing the opportunity for a community of congressional staffers 
and members from both sides of the aisle to meet regularly has been 
invaluable in these challenging times. Lauren&#x27;s leadership has taken 
the 40-year organization to new heights--and her selfless devotion to 
building this community and mentoring staffers has shaped a generation 
of thoughtful staffers.
  As Lauren leaves her role at Faith and Law to focus on her family--as 
mother to her children, Hudson, John, Sarah Grace, and Lucy, and wife 
to Brad--she leaves behind an incredible legacy that will continue to 
be felt in the Halls of Congress through the hundreds of lives she has 
impacted. On behalf of the United States Congress--and our many 
colleagues who can attest to Lauren&#x27;s impact firsthand--it is my honor 
to recognize Lauren for her distinguished career on and around Capitol 
Hill.

General, which ultimately culminated his 42-year military career. MG 
Gaston received numerous awards and decorations, including the 
Soldier&#x27;s Medal, Air Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge, and the Legion of 
Merit. Following his discharge from active duty, he continued his 
civilian education at Delta State University, obtaining a Bachelors and 
Master&#x27;s in Chemistry and an MBA in Business. He also received a 
Master&#x27;s in Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College. He began 
his civilian career with the USDA in Stoneville, MS, and was eventually 
elected as the District 3 Supervisor for Sunflower County.
  Ben is survived by his wife, Sherry Ikerd Gaston, his high school 
sweetheart, his sister, Ann Bradshaw (Jimmy) of Pearl, MS. He was 
preceded in death by his parents, James and Bobbie Ruth Gaston of 
Greenville, MS.

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alex Ramos, an 
8th grade student at Legacy School in Arizona&#x27;s 6th District.
  Each year on Veterans Day, Alex places flags on headstones at the 
Holy Hope Cemetery, a tradition his brother started 7 years ago.
  That year, his brother started with just 25 flags. This year, Alex 
placed 600 flags at graves across the cemetery.
  My team had the pleasure of joining him in November, helping to place 
the flags and honoring those who served.
  During the rest of the year, Alex goes door-to-door to collect 
donations for flags.
  At only 13 years old, he and his brother have started a rich 
tradition in our community.
  Our district is home to over 70,000 veterans. I am incredibly proud 
to know that because of kids like Alex, the next generation will keep 
their legacies alive.
