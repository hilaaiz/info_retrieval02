     HONORING THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF LITTLE UNION BAPTIST CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Little Union 
Baptist Church in Dumfries, Virginia on their 120th anniversary.
  For 120 years, Little Union Baptist Church has served as a space for 
the community to gather, connect, and worship. Little Union Baptist 
Church has deep roots in Dumfries, Virginia that can be traced back to 
Mary Bates--fondly referred to by many as ``Granny Mary.&#x27;&#x27; Mary was 
born into slavery, but she had the determination to learn to read and 
write. After the Emancipation Proclamation, Mary settled in the area 
with her husband where she proved to be a pillar in the community. She 
served as a midwife, wrote letters on behalf of those who could not, 
and helped administer medications. In 1901, Mary convinced her husband 
John to donate land to build a local church, so people would not have 
to travel to neighboring communities to attend services. The church 
built on that land flourished and eventually came to be known to the 
community as Little Union Baptist Church.
  Today, Pastor Michael L. Sessoms continues Little Union Baptist 
Church&#x27;s longstanding tradition of building community. Under his 
guidance, the church continues to grow and provides families in the 
Dumfries area with a space to gather and celebrate.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 120th 
anniversary of Little Union Baptist Church.

                          ____________________

       HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF MONTEREY-SALINAS TRANSIT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JIMMY PANETTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I have the distinct honor and privilege of 
representing California&#x27;s 19th Congressional District and on behalf of 
all the residents of the Central Coast, I would like to commend to my 
colleagues&#x27; attention to the 50th Anniversary of Monterey-Salinas 
Transit District (MST) for providing mobility services to the residents 
of Monterey County.
  The Monterey Peninsula Public Transit System Joint Powers Agency was 
formed by the cities of Carmel, Del Rey Oaks, Monterey, Pacific Grove, 
Seaside, and Monterey County on October 1, 1972, and began providing 
service on September 26, 1973. As the predecessor of Monterey-Salinas 
Transit, it served the Monterey Peninsula area, and later expanded to 
provide service to the cities of Marina, Salinas, and Watsonville. With 
the formation of the Monterey-Salinas Transit District on July 1, 2010, 
MST has served as much as one-fifth of the coastline of California from 
San Jose in the north to Paso Robles in the south at 1,300 bus stops in 
25 communities throughout Monterey, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and San 
Luis Obispo Counties.
  Through the foresight of the MST board members and the ongoing 
support of the federal government, transit service in the Monterey Bay 
region is consistently at the forefront of technology and innovation, 
with annual ridership reaching as high as 5 million passengers on 
traditional fixed-route buses as well as Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) paratransit minibus service for disabled customers, the 
popular MST Trolley system for visitors, ``MST OnCall&#x27;&#x27; demand response 
services in south Monterey County, and the JAZZ Bus Rapid Transit 
system. In 2014, with 73 percent voter support, MST became the first 
public agency in Monterey County to pass a countywide local funding 
initiative known as Measure Q to support the mobility needs of 
veterans, seniors, and persons with disabilities. MST was also the 
first transit operator in the country to finance and construct a bus 
operations and maintenance facility utilizing the federal Build America 
Bureau--Rural Initiative program, and the first transit operator to 
implement an open-loop, contactless payment system that provides 
discounted fares to eligible customers.
  Now for the second half of its first century of operation, MST is 
moving forward with a slate of new projects and initiatives to support 
their vision of connecting communities, creating opportunity and being 
kind to our planet. These include the implementation of the Better Bus 
Network, the outcome of a yearlong planning effort that will provide 
the residents of Monterey County with faster, more direct connections 
to work, school, shopping and medical appointments. The proposed MST 
SURF! Busway and Bus Rapid Transit will extend the existing JAZZ BRT 
system 6.5 miles north from Sand City to Marina utilizing bus-only 
lanes and zero emission vehicles to improving access and opportunities 
for connections to jobs on the Monterey Peninsula, recreational 
activities and easy access to educational opportunities including 
nearby California State University, Monterey Bay. Finally, MST is 
putting rolling stock and infrastructure in place today that includes 
enroute inductive charging stations, designing micro-grid technologies, 
and procuring battery electric buses as it moves to transition to a 
fleet of 162 buses to planet-friendly 100 percent zero-emission buses 
powered from renewable sources.
  In addition, MST is at the forefront of forging partnerships with 
local stakeholders to expand public transit options throughout the 
community. This past year, MST celebrated 30 years of partnership with 
the City of Monterey and Monterey Bay Aquarium in providing fast, fun, 
and free transit services to visitors and residents alike reducing 
visitor related traffic congestion, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, 
and reducing microplastics from vehicles traveling adjacent to the 
Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary. MST&#x27;s partnerships also extend to local 
colleges, with a EcoSmart Pass program with California State 
University-Monterey Bay Hartnell Community College, and Monterey 
Peninsula Colleges, discount pass programs available to all Monterey 
County school districts.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to commend the Monterey-Salinas Transit 
District for providing 50 years of exemplary public service to the 
Central Coast and ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
wish them well on the next 50 years.

                          ____________________

 INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PROVIDE FOR INTERIM APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE 
 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS AND RELATED AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY 
  FISCAL YEAR FOR WHICH APPROPRIATIONS ARE NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR 
                        SUCH COURTS AND AGENCIES

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would exempt 
from federal government shutdowns the federal and independent agencies 
that are exclusively or primarily federally funded but have 
jurisdiction over local District of Columbia civil and criminal justice 
matters. This bill is modeled on a provision I have gotten enacted each 
year

[[Page E857]]

since the 2013 federal government shutdown to exempt the D.C. 
government from federal government shutdowns.
  This bill would exempt the following agencies from federal government 
shutdowns: Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for D.C., 
D.C. Courts, D.C. Public Defender Service, D.C. Commission on Judicial 
Disabilities and Tenure, D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission and D.C. 
Criminal Justice Coordinating Council. With one exception, these 
agencies are not under the District&#x27;s control and are funded 
exclusively by the federal government. These agencies provide critical 
local services to the District, including law enforcement, and should 
continue to function during a federal government shutdown.
  Each of these agencies has been adversely affected by federal 
government shutdowns, including canceled services and furloughed 
employees. My bill would allow these agencies to continue to function 
during a federal government shutdown, in much the same way that the 
D.C. government itself is now exempt from shutting down during a 
federal government shutdown.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JAMIE RASKIN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Mr. Benjamin 
Zelenko, a distinguished constituent and exemplary citizen who helped 
shape the revival of our national commitment to equality through the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. Mr. Zelenko has accomplished a lifetime of 
excellent service to this great Nation and this body, making vital 
contributions to our journey towards a more perfect union.
  Mr. Zelenko served as a top aide to Representative Emanuel Celler, 
the legendary Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee during the apex 
of the Civil Rights Movement. Mr. Zelenko played a critical role in the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and the Gun Control Act of 
1968. Mr. Zelenko helped Representative Celler shepherd these bills 
through fraught Committee debates, floor debates and final passage.
  Later in his career, Mr. Zelenko represented Japanese Americans in 
their fight for reparations and redress for their unlawful and 
outrageous internment by the U.S. Government during World War II. He 
argued their case in United States v. William Hohri, et al. before the 
U.S. Supreme Court. This case helped pave the way for the enactment of 
the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which awarded $20,000 in reparations 
and an official apology from the U.S. Government to tens of thousands 
of Japanese Americans.
  Throughout his career in several of our Nation&#x27;s leading law firms, 
Mr. Zelenko championed human rights, workers&#x27; rights, and intellectual 
property rights. Mr. Zelenko documented his experiences helping to pass 
monumental legislation for an oral history project conducted by this 
body&#x27;s Office of the Historian for the public record. His encyclopedic 
recollection of the minutiae of the events of 1964 reminds us that 
landmark civil rights protections were not inevitable but rather were 
won through grueling and sustained efforts spanning decades of social 
struggle. A Princeton University and Harvard Law graduate, Mr. Zelenko 
contributed his great knowledge and gifts to the unending quest for a 
more perfect union. We are fortunate as a Nation that he chose to use 
his immense talents to serve the causes of social justice and equality.
  Mr. Zelenko is a beloved husband, father and grandfather. He married 
Barbara (Saltz) Zelenko in 1961. In 1964, the Zelenkos moved to 
Maryland&#x27;s beautiful Eighth District where they raised their 3 
children, Brian, Laura and Carin. Ben and Barbara Zelenko still live in 
the same house they first occupied. This year, Mr. Zelenko celebrated 
his 90th birthday surrounded by his loving children and 6 
grandchildren, Leslie, Jennifer, Sasha, Katya, Lia and Kayla. Mr. 
Zelenko is known by his family for being a gracious and captivating 
host, performing magic shows at all 6 of his grandchildren&#x27;s birthday 
parties and seizing any opportunity to tell a great story. I am proud 
to salute Mr. Zelenko for his lifetime of service and extraordinary 
character.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize 
a stalwart figure in the Buffalo community, Carl Thomas. After roughly 
4 decades of leading by example at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and 
Kevin&#x27;s Guest House, it is only proper to acknowledge and give 
gratitude for a lifelong dedication to those in need of help.
  A graduate of Lafayette High School, he has always put the needs of 
his hometown neighbors ahead of his own. At the very beginning of his 
professional career, Carl recognized an unfortunate and common 
challenge for so many cancer patients--having a stable place to stay 
during treatment. As a volunteer at Kevin&#x27;s Guest House, a local 
hospitality guest house, he undoubtedly recognized that a community 
effort can make the bleak reality of cancer a little easier on a 
patient and their loved ones. Of course, Carl was familiar with cancer 
treatment and hospital care due to his father&#x27;s employment at Roswell. 
As he began his own career at Roswell Park (later earning the role of 
Chief of Public Safety). Carl devoted his time and energy toward the 
needs and safety of the entire Roswell campus. He

[[Page E856]]

saw these 2 institutions, Kevin&#x27;s Guest House and Roswell Park, as 
inherently intertwined and was one of the earliest to recognize Roswell 
Park&#x27;s leading role in the fight against cancer. Carl&#x27;s passion for 
Roswell&#x27;s success earned him the position as Chief Organizational and 
Community Liaison. In essence, he has worked as an ambassador for 
Roswell with community organizations, government officials, churches, 
and block clubs in Western New York.
  As an African American executive, Carl Thomas has often cited his 
responsibility to lead a new generation of achievers. Those who know 
Carl understand retirement will not result in the end of his 
mentorship; as a resident of the University District, he has already 
expressed an interest in maintaining his position as a role model 
within the community. Nonetheless, retirement will allow Carl some 
much-deserved time with his wife of over 4 decades. Betty, along with 
their children, Mario, Samantha, and Phylicia. Buffalonians and Roswell 
Park patients, alike, owe Carl an incredible debt of gratitude, and it 
is my pleasure to recognize his career as a capable worker and generous 
man.

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize 
the longtime treasurer of the Amherst Democratic Committee. Ronald 
Gilson. A resident of Amherst since 1962. Ron has been an indispensable 
member oft he Committee since 1994.
  He jumped in head-first, ensuring that technical operations like 
utilities. internal telephone banks, and essential supplies were always 
cared for at headquarters. His willingness to volunteer in this 
capacity was also incredibly valuable to Chairman Jeremy Zellner when 
the Erie County Democratic Committee moves its headquarters to 
Larkinville. Ron was there to ensure a seamless transition with the 
proper technology setup. Naturally, he also became familiar with the 
Committee&#x27;s practice of posting signs, gathering signatures, and 
distributing campaign literature. Just 5 years into his involvement 
with ADC, the Amherst Democratic Chairman approached Ron to become a 
temporary treasurer. Temporary, of course, is not an accurate 
description of Ron&#x27;s time as treasurer--as he just handed the reins 
over after 22 years.
  Ron also volunteers his time at the Buffalo and Eric County Naval 
Park as a docent and technical advisor. He volunteers his knowledge and 
time to countless citizens and visitors, alike, so they can appreciate 
the fearless bravery of our veterans and the richness of our local 
history. On the tours that he provides, Ron has the ability to capture 
the imagination of young Americans, so they understand the sacrifices 
that were made to ensure our collective freedom. The staff at the Naval 
Park is undoubtedly grateful for his continued dedication to their 
endeavors.
  Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention Ron&#x27;s consistent involvement 
at the Niagara Frontier Radio Reading Service for the blind with his 
wife, Corine. Throughout the week, this organization reads newspapers, 
magazines, and books for the visually impaired. Ron&#x27;s involvement with 
Niagara Frontier Radio Service, Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; 
Military Park, and the Amherst Democratic Committee prove him to be a 
worthy candidate of recognition. I am excited to honor Ron for his 
selfless efforts that have such a tangible impact on our community.

    RECOGNIZING THE OPERATION OF THE INTEGRATED WASTE TREATMENT UNIT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON

                                of idaho

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, alongside my esteemed 
colleagues Senators Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, to recognize the 
committed staff at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site&#x27;s 
Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU). In the face of many challenges, 
the employees who supported IWTU demonstrated professionalism, 
expertise, dedication to the mission, and exemplified the spirit of 
American innovation.
  IWTU engineers, scientists, crafts specialists, plant operators, and 
administration professionals always believed they could overcome the 
challenges of this first-of-a-kind radioactive liquid waste treatment 
facility. Following its construction from 2007 to 2011, the IWTU 
underwent testing of its steam-reforming process, which was chosen to 
solidify 900,000 gallons of liquid sodium-bearing waste from an 
underground tank farm. This waste was generated during the INL&#x27;s spent 
nuclear fuel reprocessing mission during the height of the Cold War.
  From the first demonstration run at the IWTU in 2012, mechanical 
problems were apparent as metal filters became plugged, resulting in a 
quick shutdown of the facility. During subsequent runs, further 
mechanical problems surfaced as well as chemistry challenges within the 
IWTU&#x27;s primary reaction vessel. The Department of Energy (DOE) and its 
contractors didn&#x27;t give up. Together, they devised a plan to 
systematically identify and resolve all problems. They employed some of 
the brightest scientists at the INL and across the country, worked with 
academia in several states, and utilized the resources of corporate and 
small businesses. In all, engineers, scientists, and fabricators made 
hundreds of modifications to the IWTU, and with each subsequent 
demonstration run, the facility became more reliable and predictable.
  On April 11, 2023, 16 years after construction began, IWTU operators 
were given permission to start radiological operations. At first, 10 
percent radioactive liquid waste was blended with 90 percent simulant. 
This ratio was increased to 50:50 and later to 100 percent sodium-
bearing waste. For those on the project who sacrificed countless 
weekends, holidays, and quality time with family, this moment was the 
culmination of years of committed work for a greater cause.
  I want to thank all the Idaho Environmental Coalition employees who 
have supported this project. Their contributions are protecting the 
Snake River Plain Aquifer, which is the primary source of drinking 
water and agricultural water for more than 300,000 Idahoans. 
Furthermore, their actions in treating legacy Cold War waste and 
closing these sites pave the way for future nuclear research work in 
Idaho.
  I would like to join my distinguished colleagues Senators Crapo and 
Risch, in congratulating the IWTU team on this extremely important 
achievement. They represent the most talented and committed individuals 
in the DOE Complex. Perhaps more importantly, they represent the 
greatest of our country and the ingenuity that makes the United States 
stand out in the world.

            RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF SUSAN GRELICK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize 
the first woman elected Town Supervisor and Town Clerk of Amherst, 
Susan Grelick. She embodies the very best of our community, and has 
shaped Amherst, NY into one of the best rated and safest places to live 
in the entire country.
  A graduate of Union College, Susan would later earn her MBA, JD, and 
master&#x27;s degrees in Information Science and American Economic History. 
She utilized her extensive education to the town&#x27;s benefit--always in 
search of ways to improve its financial stand, promote local 
businesses, and preserve neighborhoods and green space. Indeed, during 
her 9 years as Supervisor, Amherst had the highest bond rating of any 
municipality in Western New York. Susan also initiated the Town&#x27;s first 
Vision Summits, a tool she used to develop a comprehensive plan for her 
future agenda. Once her time had finished as a town official, Susan 
became the legislative director and counsel to New York Senate Majority 
Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins. This is in addition to involvement in 
countless local organizations, including as a Trustee Emeritus of the 
Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village, as a Board member of the Amherst 
Youth Foundation, and as Vice President of the Chautauqua Institution 
Women&#x27;s Club Board of Directors. She previously worked as President of 
the Amherst Youth Foundation, President of the Buffalo Amherst Business 
and Professional Women&#x27;s Association, and sat on the Board of Directors 
for YMCA of Greater Buffalo, the UB Alumni Association, and the Erie 
County Industrial Development Agency. Her commitment to public service 
goes beyond the listed organizations. She is unquestionably sincere in 
her desire to help others, and she has gone above and beyond to deliver 
for her neighbors and community.
  Many groups have recognized Susan over the years, so it is only 
fitting that the Amherst Democratic Committee recognizes her efforts 
over the last 25 years as a member. Susan Grelick has been a steadfast 
friend to so many in the Western New York area, and all its citizens 
(particularly those in Amherst), owe her a debt of gratitude. She has 
been an asset to the growth of our region, and I am thrilled that she 
is being honored for her inspiring achievements. I wish her the best in 
all her future endeavors.

                          ____________________

            REMEMBERING CAPTAIN ANDRIY ``JUICE&#x27;&#x27; PILSHCHIKOV

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ERIC SWALWELL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of Ukrainian 
fighter pilot Captain Andriy Pilshchikov, better known by his call sign 
``Juice,&#x27;&#x27; who tragically lost his life at the age of 30 while fighting 
for Ukraine&#x27;s freedom on Friday, August 25, 2023.
  Born in February 1993, Andriy was a Captain in Ukraine&#x27;s Air Force 
40th Tactical Aviation Brigade and leader of the ``Ghost of Kyiv&#x27;&#x27; 
unit. He flew MiG-29 fighter jets, protecting the central and northern 
Ukrainian air space from Russian attacks. Andriy earned the call sign 
``Juice&#x27;&#x27; during his time in California performing training exercises 
with the U.S. Air National Guard because he preferred juice over 
alcoholic beverages.
  Juice boldly resisted the Russian air offensive despite using aging 
Soviet-era technology. With destroyed ground-based navigation, Juice 
flew missions using simple Garmin GPS units.
  Juice was one of the lead advocates for the delivery of F-16 fighter 
jets to Ukraine from allied countries. His efforts included contacting 
American government officials to encourage support for this cause. Many 
of us became familiar with Juice from his numerous interviews with 
prominent Western news outlets. Luckily, allied countries, including 
the United States, agreed to send F-16s. Juice was among the initial 
group of Ukrainian pilots slated for F-16 training due to his fluency 
in English.
  Juice and 2 other pilots, Major Vyacheslav Minka and Major Serhiy 
Prokazin, tragically lost their lives on August 25 when a pair of L-39 
Combat Trainer jets collided during a training accident near Zhytomyr.
  In June 2022, I was introduced to Juice by actor and filmmaker Sean 
Penn. Over dinner in Washington D.C., Juice shared his passion for 
Ukraine&#x27;s freedom and the need for the United States to provide fighter 
jets to his country. I promised Juice I would seek that. And I plan to 
follow through on that promise.
  Juice was a true Air Force leader, possessing tactical skills, 
confidence, and a calm demeanor under the immense pressure that war 
brings. His bravery and courage went above and beyond, flying over 500 
combat hours, never once backing away from a fight. He is survived by 
his devoted girlfriend, Melaniya, and mother, Lillia. May we never 
forget his service and the ultimate sacrifice he made for the freedom 
of Ukraine.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 18, 2023

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
memory of my good friend, former Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist, who 
also served alongside us, in this House chamber for 12 years, as the 
U.S. Representative for the 7th District of Tennessee. He was a trusted 
leader and treasured friend who will be deeply missed.
  He accomplished a rare feat that every elected leader aspires to, 
winning every election in his path of public service, including 6 terms 
in Congress and 2 terms as the 47th Governor of Tennessee. Don was an 
original ``Reaganaut,&#x27;&#x27; first elected to Congress in 1982 during 
President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Administration. As a successful business 
owner and entrepreneur, his expertise and personal insight were 
invaluable in his leadership on the Ways and Means Committee, where he 
stood firm on conservative American values.
  His love and compassion for the people of Tennessee led him from 
Capitol Hill to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in 1994. Unwavering in his 
convictions, Gov. Sundquist took on monumental issues, including 
welfare reform that lifted 40,000 families out of poverty, a 
comprehensive crime bill focused on victim&#x27;s rights, expanding 
broadband to every public school and library in Tennessee, and earning 
National accolades for the state&#x27;s economic success on his watch.

  In addition to his courageous public service, he was also a proud 
veteran of the United States Navy. Of all the honorable titles that 
have been etched into history beside his name, Don&#x27;s most cherished 
were husband, father, grandfather and friend. Thanks to our longtime 
friendship in the U.S. House, Don later introduced me to my beautiful 
Tennessee bride, Cynthia. He and his First Lady Martha graciously 
hosted our wedding at the Governor&#x27;s mansion in 1999, remaining 
constant friends all the while. It is for his dedicated friendship and 
partnership in public service that I shall be eternally grateful. My 
wife Cynthia and I offer our heartfelt sympathy and prayers to the 
entire Sundquist family and the people of Tennessee.
