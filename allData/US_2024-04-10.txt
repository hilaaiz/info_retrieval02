     COMMENDING JOHN KONIAR FOR HIS SERVICE TO ALABAMA DISTRICT ONE

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. JERRY L. CARL

                               of alabama

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Foley Mayor John 
Koniar and his service to Alabama&#x27;s First Congressional District.
  John entered active duty in the United States Air Force as 2nd 
lieutenant in 1965 and was honorably discharged as a Captain in 1969. 
He joined Vulcan, Inc. in 1971, and he retired as a vice president of 
sales after working there for 37 years. John Koniar served on the Foley 
City Council from 1980 until 2006. He was then elected mayor in 2006 
and served three terms until 2020. John was incredibly influential to 
the City of Foley due to his strong leadership. His dedication to the 
city was vital for the growth of Foley. He took pride in his dedicated 
employees and how well they represented their community.
  His presence and leadership promoted a healthy work environment in 
which people could succeed. We are so grateful for all he has done for 
Alabama&#x27;s First Congressional District.

                          ____________________

                                  _____

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Representative William Delahunt who recently passed peacefully at 
his home in Quincy, Massachusetts. Representative Delahunt, born in 
that very same town, spent his life dedicated to its people.
  Representative Delahunt was a lifelong public servant. He began his 
career as a Radioman for the Coast Guard, an honor he brought all the 
way to the House as co-chair of the Coast Guard Caucus. Representative 
Delahunt progressed through a life of Public Service. He served as a 
Quincy Town Councilor, State Representative, District Attorney, and 
finally House Representative, before his retirement in 2011.
  Representative Delahunt always put the needs of his constituents 
first. When low-income residents in his home state struggled to pay 
their heating bills during the winter of 2006, he got little assistance 
from the Bush administration. Instead of doing nothing, he famously 
brokered an international fuel sale for approximately 50,000 
Massachusetts residents in dire need. His direct negotiation of this 
sale ensured even his most vulnerable constituents could keep the heat 
on that winter.
  Well-respected for his lasting commitment to human rights, 
Representative Delahunt served as the chair of the Subcommittee on 
International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight in the 110th 
Congress. I had the distinct pleasure of serving with Representative 
Delahunt, and I still carry a deep respect for Representative 
Delahunt&#x27;s strong principles and consistent defense of human rights.
  Our thoughts and prayers are with his fiance, Julia Pagana, daughters 
Kirsten and Kara, and two grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, please join me in 
honoring the life of a great man of this chamber.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, service, 
and career of Tom Dauterman of Chico, California who passed away 
peacefully after a three-year battle with cancer on February 26, 2024.
  Tom was born on July 19, 1942, in Los Angeles, California. His family 
moved to Durham, California in 1948, where he attended school, and he 
graduated as a member of the class of 1960. He worked as a carpenter 
with his father building houses after high school.
  On November 30, 1963, Tom married the love of his life, Sue Mathews, 
and they began their life together, making their home in Chico.
  Tom left his job with PG&amp;E and established Thomas Welding in his 
garage in Chico in 1972. Thomas Hydraulics followed in 1974 as well as 
Thomas Manufacturing in 1996. What was once Tom&#x27;s small business idea 
now stands as one of the largest machine shops north of Sacramento.
  Tom served the Chico community with excellence, teaching and 
mentoring many and never hesitated to share his time and knowledge with 
those he encountered. His encouragement and support of welding and 
agriculture programs in local high schools has impacted countless 
students in our local community.
  He was a true engineer as well as a builder; taking on many projects, 
which included innovating and developing agricultural equipment.
  Throughout the years Tom enjoyed vacations with friends, and 
attending classic car, boat, and air shows. Most recently he looked 
forward to his weekly visits to Hotel Diamond for coffee, lunch bunch, 
and tea at three. Tom also enjoyed spending time at Lake Almanor and 
hosted an annual 4th of July celebration for 19 years.
  His love for the community of Chico drove Tom to be a faithful 
supporter of the Boys and Girls Club as well as the Salvation Army and 
additionally many other community organizations. Tom was also a 35-year 
member of Chico Rotary, as well as a Chico Elks Lodge member for 53 
years.
  Tom will be missed not only by his family and friends but also by the 
greater Chico community who benefitted from his benevolence. Many 
projects and endeavors were accomplished with Tom&#x27;s silent 
participation both financially and with hours of hard work. He was a 
true public servant. We forever will be grateful for the legacy he has 
left.

  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Vietnam and Korean War 
veterans who traveled to Washington, D.C. on April 10, 2024, with Honor 
Flight Chicago, a program that provides WWll, Vietnam, and Korean War 
veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials on the National Mall 
in Washington, D.C. These memorials were built to honor their courage

  The American veteran is one of our greatest treasures. The Soldiers, 
Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled here on 
April 10 answered our nation&#x27;s call to service during one of its 
greatest times of need. From the Pacific-Asian Theater to the Korean 
Theater, these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave service, and 
sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a hero. We owe 
them more gratitude that can ever be expressed.
  I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the career of Mr. 
Bruce Busler who is retiring after 14 years of civil service as the 
director of the Joint Deployment Process and Analysis Center at United 
States Transportation Command.
  Bruce is a once-in-a-generation leader who has made a 
transformational impact on the Defense Transportation System and the 
Department of Defense at large. He shaped programs necessary for 
mobility capabilities such as airlift, sealift and surface transport to 
support the national defense strategy.
  In his efforts to support the Joint Deployment and Distribution 
Enterprise, Mr. Busler spearheaded operational analysis and decision-
making initiatives through harnessing the power of data for the Joint 
Force. These efforts through the Enterprise Data Science initiative 
enhanced modeling and simulation capabilities to garner effectiveness, 
efficiency, and synchronization globally.
  Bruce is a strategic thinker who can convey complex concepts into 
readily understood terms for senior leaders to forge consensus for 
action while also leading a diverse organization across multiple 
commands. His executive leadership can be distilled down as a visionary 
data architect leveraging ``big data&#x27;&#x27; analysis to persuasively advance 
mobility capability needs in a collaborative manner to meet national 
requirements for global transportation with high-impact results.
  Bruce&#x27;s accomplishments are countless, but for the Congress, he led 
both the 2018 and 2020 NDAA directed mobility studies evaluating the 
capabilities critical to deploying and sustaining U.S. military forces 
at optimal levels. Throughout these efforts, he meticulously mapped out 
the requirements needed to deploy, and redeploy our military and 
requirements for a prolonged recapitalization effort to revitalize an 
aging sealift fleet in support of our National Defense. Additionally, 
he linked critical wartime patient movement operations into an end-to-
end airlift cycle ensuring Critical Care Air Transport Teams were 
available when needed to treat our most precious assets, our military 
personnel and their families. Bruce also delivered a first-of-its-kind 
fuel assessment study focusing on the fuel distribution challenges 
within the Indo-Pacific region. Finally, for only the third time in its 
history, based on Bruce&#x27;s predictive analytics and

[[Page E325]]

modeling, in 2021 U.S. Transportation Command activated the Civil 
Reserve Air Fleet to augment the Afghan refugee evacuation, the largest 
non-combatant evacuation operation in U.S. history rescuing 124,000 
refugees in just 14 days.
  In addition to his 27 honorable years served in the Air Force as a 
colonel and command pilot with over 3,800 flight hours, Bruce set the 
standard for mastery of the Defense Transportation System. His ability 
to deploy data to anticipate the changing strategic environment while 
grappling with resource priorities has been key to identifying and 
resolving mobility enterprise challenges. Bruce is a true leader in 
transportation. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in thanking Mr. Bruce 
Busler for over 41 years of dedicated and faithful service to our great 
Nation.

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. William 
``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Douglass of Sherman, Texas, and present him with the 
Congressional Patriot Award. Bill is a distinguished American who has 
faithfully served our community and country.
  A native of Pennsylvania, Bill graduated from Muhlenberg College in 
1958 as a Dean&#x27;s List Scholar. He later joined the United States Marine 
Corps and Army, serving as a First Lieutenant specializing in Combat 
Intelligence. Afterwards, Bill began his career in the oil industry as 
part of ExxonMobil&#x27;s Sales team and

[[Page E327]]

quickly worked his way up to become one of their Senior Advisors. It 
was during this time that his entrepreneurial spirit pushed him to 
pursue his very own path in the oil distribution business. In the early 
1980s, Bill left Exxon and purchased a petroleum distribution company 
in Sherman, now known as Douglass Distributing. Douglass Distributing 
employs over 400 individuals across North Texas whose establishments 
include gas stations, Lone Star convenience stores, and fast-food 
franchises. If you drive through North Texas. you&#x27;ll likely stop at one 
of the many stores owned by Bill.
  For his exemplary work, Bill&#x27;s signature Lone Star brand won 
Convenience Store of the Year twice. He was also recognized as an 
Employer of the Year by the Chamber of Commerce and the Texas Workforce 
Commission. In 2008, Bill was inducted into the Convenience Store Hall 
of Fame. Currently, he is the Chairman of the Texoma Medical Center&#x27;s 
Board of Trustees and is a board member at Austin College, where he 
received an honorary Ph.D. for his contributions to the Sherman 
community. I am proud of the work Bill has accomplished to innovate the 
next generation of convenience stores and improve the world around us.
  It is an honor to bestow Bill with the Patriot Award for his 
exceptional service to our Nation and the people of North Texas.

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, as the former Co-Chair of the National 
Prayer Breakfast, I rise to give thanks and a heartfelt tribute to Dr. 
Timothy C. Tennent for fifteen years of faithful and outstanding 
leadership as the President of Asbury Theological Seminary in Kentucky. 
A true man of God with a brilliant mind for ministry and a warm heart 
for missions, Dr. Tennent will conclude his remarkable presidency this 
June, as he and his wife, Julie, follow God&#x27;s next calling into global 
ministry and scholarship.
  Under President Tennent&#x27;s Spirit-inspired leadership. Asbury 
Theological Seminary has grown tremendously in size, spiritual stature, 
and scholarship, dramatically expanding its programs and impacts around 
the nation and world for the sake of the Gospel. Today it is generally 
recognized as the largest and leading Seminary in the evangelical 
Wesleyan-Arminian theological tradition. President Tennent&#x27;s vision has 
led to many innovative new programs focused on global ministry and 
church planting and to impressive growth in financial support from 
donors. Many pastors and spiritual leaders in my state of Michigan are 
grateful graduates of Asbury Seminary. In my district, Spring Arbor 
University has a close association with Asbury Seminary, as sister 
institutions affiliated with the evangelical holiness wing of 
Methodism. In my prior work as a minister and Christian college 
administrator, I came to deeply respect Asbury Seminary.
  President Tennent has been a courageous and eloquent advocate for 
Biblical truth, faithfulness, and theological orthodoxy in his 
presidential leadership, public speaking and

[[Page E326]]

preaching, and authorship of many books. He is widely recognized as one 
of the Nation&#x27;s top evangelical theological leaders. The Apostle John 
described Christ as the ``Word&#x27;&#x27; who came to us ``full of grace and 
truth,&#x27;&#x27; a model to which Christians aspire. Dr. Tennent has faithfully 
proclaimed Biblical truth with grace, warmth, and humility in his 
leadership and life.
  I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in 
congratulating Dr. Timothy Tennent as he concludes his outstanding 
presidency at Asbury Theological Seminary and in expressing blessings 
as he and his wife, Julie, enter their next phase of service. I believe 
the Lord&#x27;s words in the book of Matthew truly apply to them: ``Well 
done, thou good and faithful servants.&#x27;&#x27;

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Margaret 
Spalluzzi and her fellow Rosie the Riveters as they are awarded the 
Rosie the Riveter Congressional Gold Medal.
  Born on November 2, 1921, Margaret was raised in Plymouth, 
Massachusetts. After reading an ad in the newspaper calling for women 
to fill jobs that men left behind while fighting in World War II, 
Margaret dared 10 of her friends to come with her to sign up to be 
welders. After completing their training in Quincy, six of the women 
stayed on as welders at the Hingham Shipyard. One of the original Rosie 
the Riveters, Margaret, joined the war effort welding warships from 
1942 until the war ended in 1945.
  During the war, around 2,500 women worked at the Hingham Shipyard 
where they built hundreds of ships. Security at the shipyard was tight, 
and workers were told not to share any information about what they were 
doing. The working conditions could also be very tough. Working in a 
room with no heat. Margaret had to wear steel toe boots and flannel 
pajamas under her heavy work clothes just to stay warm during the cold 
New England winters. However, Margaret was proud to go into work and 
help her country while her brothers were serving in the military and 
her husband, Antone ``Tony,&#x27;&#x27; was serving in the Navy as an 
electrician. Her shift at the shipyard was from 7:00 am to 3:00 pm, but 
Margaret often worked overtime and seven days a week. With her first 
paycheck from welding, Margaret bought her mother a radio.
  After the war, when her husband came back to Massachusetts, Margaret 
and Tony raised their daughter, Annette, together in the home that Tony 
built in Kingston. Margaret later went on to work at Plimoth Patuxet 
for 32 years as a costumed interpreter and then a greeter, until she 
retired at 80. In retirement, Margaret enjoys spending time with her 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren and visiting the Kingston Senior 
Center to take classes and meet up with friends.
  On April 10, 2024, Congress will award the Rosie the Riveter 
Congressional Gold Medal, which will then be displayed at the National 
Museum of American History. This medal is to recognize the 
contributions of all the women who served our country during World War 
II as Rosie the Riveters and the inspiration that they provided for 
future generations.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Margaret Spalluzzi, and I ask that 
my colleagues join me in celebrating Margaret and her fellow Rosie the 
Riveters for all the critical work they did to support our country 
during the war.

RECOGNIZING THE 116TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE UNITED STATES 
                              ARMY RESERVE

                                  _____

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
116th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army Reserve.
  For over a century, generations of Americans have served their 
country in the reserve, leveraging a wide array of skills, educational 
backgrounds, and expertise to respond to crises across the country, and 
the globe. In cities and towns across the country, the Army Reserve has 
always been composed of brave, strong, purposeful men and women with 
great passions, talents, and abilities.
  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve Force in 1908, the Reserve 
Corps has been ready to serve at a moment&#x27;s notice, mobilizing more 
than one million Army Reserve servicemembers in defense of our country. 
Through two World Wars, the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and 
the Global War on Terror, our brave reserve soldiers have served 
through crises, emergencies, and natural disasters, making positive 
impacts on people&#x27;s lives around the globe.
  Year after year, the Army Reserve continues to prove critical to our 
nation&#x27;s national security apparatus by harnessing civilian expertise 
across professions like artificial intelligence, medicine, and 
engineering, among so many others. There are more than 190,000 Army 
Reserve Soldiers and 11,000 civilians are currently stationed across 
all 50 States and 23 countries across the globe. Right here in New 
Jersey we are proud to have 4,000 soldiers and 68 units contributing to 
their forward-positioned force. Their service to our country and our 
great state is invaluable to the readiness and capability of our Joint 
Forces, and the safety of our communities.
  This force begins their next 116 years of service as one of the most 
experienced outfits in American history, and I am grateful for the 
service of each and every one of them. I look forward to continuing to 
support Army Reserve servicemembers in achieving their mission of--
ready now, shaping tomorrow.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the 488th Intelligence Squadron at RAF Mildenhall.
  Through 50 years of peace and conflict, the ``Bats&#x27;&#x27; of the 488th 
have delivered time-sensitive intelligence to warfighters and 
decisionmakers through their superb execution of RC-135 intelligence 
operations, and in recent years have participated in such Operations as 
Atlantic Resolve, Inherent Resolve, and more. The Bats represent the 
cutting-edge of U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
efforts in the EUCOM theater of operations, driving allied 
interoperability with the United Kingdom&#x27;s RC-135 program, leading 
analytic integration efforts with new NATO countries, and ultimately 
rising to the occasion following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, 
providing critical intelligence and overwatch for senior United States 
diplomatic and defense leaders.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the ``Bats&#x27;&#x27; for their 
dedication and selfless service to keep our country safe, and to 
congratulate them on this monumental anniversary.

                                  _____

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. JAMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and say thank you to 
Warren Police Commissioner William Dwyer for serving Southeast Michigan 
for over 60 years throughout his career in law enforcement.
  His career spans the Detroit Police Department, the Farmington Hills 
Police Department, and the Warren Police Department.
  Day after day and year after year, Commissioner Dwyer consistently 
went above and beyond the call of duty. He received the Presidential 
Medal from the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, the Collegian 
Award from Wayne State University, and the Crime Stoppers of Michigan 
Police Executive of the Year award in 2010.
  He served on the International Association of Chiefs of Police, 
Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, Oakland County Chief&#x27;s 
Association, Southeastern Michigan Chiefs of Police Association, High-
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, Federal Anti-Terrorism Task Force, and 
the Michigan Homeland Security Council, just to name a few.
  Even while receiving all these awards, he still found time to turn 
Warren, Michigan into one of the safest cities in the entire state.
  Commissioner Dwyer is the exact, literal definition of what it means 
to be a public servant. On behalf of all of Michigan&#x27;s 10th 
Congressional District, I thank him for his service.

      TRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL CHAMPION USC WOMEN&#x27;S BASKETBALL TEAM

                                  _____
                                 

                         HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 2024 
NCAA Women&#x27;s National Basketball Champions, the University of South 
Carolina WBB Gamecocks. In a tremendous demonstration of skill, 
teamwork, and depth, the Gamecocks clinched their third national title 
on April 7, 2024, after a perfect season.
  The road to the championship was far from easy. The Gamecocks 
embarked on a season unlike any other, achieving 38 consecutive wins. 
Pre-NCAA tournament victories included a highly competitive match-up 
against reigning champions Louisiana State University and a nail-biter 
against the University of Tennessee. During the NCAA tournament, the 
Gamecocks beat No. 15 seed in-state neighbor Presbyterian College; No. 
8 seed University of North Carolina; No. 4 seed Indiana University; No. 
3 seed Oregon State University; No. 3 seed NC State University; and No. 
1 seed University of Iowa.
  The championship game was the first time the Gamecocks and Hawkeyes 
met since Iowa, led by their star point guard Caitlin Clark, defeated 
South Carolina in the 2023 NCAA Final Four. This time, teamplay 
defeated individual performance. The Gamecocks had four players in 
double figures, led by Tessa Johnson with 19 points; Kamilla Cardoso 
with 15 points and 17 rebounds; Te-Hina Paopao with 14 points; and 
Chloe Kitts with 11 points and 10 rebounds. South Carolina guards Raven 
Johnson and Bree Hall&#x27;s defensive contributions slowed down Clark, who 
was fresh off a 41-point victory, two days earlier.
  South Carolina&#x27;s success can be attributed to the contributions of 
the Gamecock bench, which outscored Iowa&#x27;s bench 37-0. Their 37 of 
South Carolina&#x27;s 87 points in the Championship game gave the sports 
world an appropriate understanding of our Nation&#x27;s motto, E Pluribus 
Unum (out of many, one).
  This victory is a testament to Coach Dawn Staley&#x27;s leadership skills. 
Her dedication to developing young talent and ability to create a 
culture of excellence were rewarded handsomely. After last year&#x27;s Final 
Four defeat, all five South Carolina starters--one of which was an All-
American and another the future No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft--departed 
the team. All for various and good reasons.
  Despite receiving an Associated Press Top 25 preseason ranking of No. 
6, the 8-time SEC Champions quickly rose to No. 1. Their unwavering 
dedication, offensive prowess, and defensive tenacity left opponents at 
a loss. From each opening tip to the final buzzer, this South Carolina 
team were models of resilience and determination, with their relentless 
spirit propelling them to this ultimate triumph.
  Coach Staley, who I am proud to call a friend, led a team that lost 
all five of last year&#x27;s starters. She recruited and assembled some 
remarkable and talented young women and built them into an outstanding 
team. Their starting line-up consisted of No. 10 Kamilla Cardoso, 
senior and starting center from Montes Claros, Brazil; No. 0 Te-Hina 
Paopao, senior and starting guard from Oceanside, California; No. 21 
Chloe Kitts, sophomore and starting forward from Oviedo, Florida; No. 
23 Bree Hall, junior and starting guard from Dayton, Ohio; and No. 25 
Raven Johnson, sophomore and starting guard from Atlanta, Georgia.
  Their supporting cast consisted of No. 12 MiLaysia Fulwiley, freshman 
guard and No. 2 Ashlyn Watkins, sophomore forward both from Columbia, 
South Carolina; No. 5 Tessa Johnson, freshman guard from Albertville, 
Minnesota; No. 20 Sania Feagin, junior forward from Ellenwood, Georgia; 
No. 35 Sakima Walker, senior center from Columbus, Ohio; and No. 15 
Adhel Tac, freshman center from Grand Prairie, Texas.
  This national championship win is a collective achievement, but 
special mention is appropriate for their only player currently 
scheduled to depart, Kamilla Cardoso. She was named Most Outstanding 
Player of the Tournament after averaging a double-double during post-
season play. Cardoso also drew All-America honors from the U.S. 
Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) (First Team), the AP (Second 
Team), and the Wooden Award. Additionally, the Women&#x27;s Basketball 
Coaches Association (WBCA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) named 
her Defensive Player of the Year, and she was named to the All-SEC. 
First Team.
  Some individual achievements of her teammates should be celebrated as 
well. Guards Raven Johnson and Te-Hina Paopao, along with forward 
Ashlyn Watkins, earned spots on the All-SEC Second Team and MiLaysia 
Fulwiley made the SEC All-Freshman Team. Paopao also picked up All-
America recognition from the USBWA (Second Team) and the AP (honorable 
mention).
  Coach Staley, a legend in her own right, has transformed South 
Carolina WBB into an absolute basketball powerhouse. The Gamecocks have 
won 8 regular season championships, 8 SEC tournament championships, and 
3 national championships. This year, Coach Staley was named the 
Naismith Women&#x27;s College Coach of the Year, AP Women&#x27;s Coach of the 
Year, WBCA Coach of the Year, and SEC Coach of the Year. She also 
became the first Black coach, male or female, to win three Division 1 
basketball titles and the fifth coach to win at least three titles.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in celebrating 
this remarkable University of South Carolina Women&#x27;s Basketball team. 
As the confetti settles and the celebrations continue, one thing is 
certain: the future of South Carolina women&#x27;s basketball is bright. Go 
Gamecocks.
