            CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF COLORADO LEGAL SERVICES

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. DIANA DeGETTE

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colorado Legal 
Services on its 100th anniversary and to honor its enduring commitment 
to justice for all Coloradans.
  Founded as the Legal Aid Society of Denver in February 1925, Colorado 
Legal Services has been a lifeline for low-income individuals and 
seniors in every county across our state--providing free, high-quality 
civil legal assistance to those who need it most. As a former trial 
attorney, I understand how critical legal representation can be when 
everything is at stake.
  Whether it&#x27;s helping someone keep their home, secure child support, 
access health care, or find safety from abuse, Colorado Legal Services 
delivers life-changing support that strengthens families and 
communities across our state.
  Their work extends far beyond the courtroom--offering clients the 
stability, emotional support, and community resources they need to move 
forward.
  In August of this year alone, Colorado Legal Services opened nearly a 
thousand new cases to help Coloradans facing housing insecurity, 
domestic violence, and other urgent challenges. That&#x27;s the kind of 
quiet, vital work that keeps our communities strong and resilient.
  I want to congratulate Colorado Legal Services on a century of 
unwavering service and express my deepest gratitude to its staff, 
volunteers, and supporters for their tireless dedication to equal 
justice under the law.

    CELEBRATING 150 YEARS OF ST. PETER&#x27;S UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST IN 
                             MILLBURY, OHIO

                                  _____

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker. I rise to recognize a significant milestone 
in the life of St. Peter&#x27;s United Church of Christ in Millbury, Ohio. 
The congregation celebrates its 150th anniversary on Sunday, October 
12, 2025.
  Only one year after the founding of Millbury, St. Peter&#x27;s Church was 
founded in 1875 by twelve families of German immigrants who came 
together to form the German Evangelical United St. Peter&#x27;s 
Congregation. It is the oldest continuous church in the community. 
Church records show that the first meeting took place at the home of 
Adam Martin, a home that stands yet today, and was officiated by 
Reverend Andrews of Genoa St. John&#x27;s Church.
  A fire sparked by a passing train burned the newly constructed 
building in 1878 and a new building was finally completed in 1884 using 
the railroad settlement. That year, the church adopted its first 
constitution. In 1908 a parsonage was built and a minister was hired.
  The following years brought growth along with stained glass windows 
and a pipe organ. In 1934 following a national merger the congregation 
was renamed St. Peter&#x27;s Evangelical and Reformed Church. Since a 1957 
merger the church has held its current name, St. Peter&#x27;s United Church 
of Christ.
  Branching out into the community in the 1950&#x27;s, adjacent land was 
purchased and a park was built which serves the neighborhood, gardens 
and athletic teams. Uniquely, a boulder which resembled the image of 
Christ at Gethsemane was unearthed in 1969. Moved next to the church, a 
plaque was inscribed with Mathew 16:18, ``And I say unto thee, that 
thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the 
gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&#x27;&#x27;
  Believing that ``every generation is called to live out its faith in 
meaningful worship, honest reflection and sincere devotion to God,&#x27;&#x27; 
the church continued to grow through the decades. A youth program 
produced musical groups Kid&#x27;s Praise and The Light Brigade which toured 
the states in our region and visited the Creation Music Festival in 
Pennsylvania. Community services continued throughout, as the 
congregation supports food pantries, partners with service 
organization, has hosted an AA chapter for over forty years, opened its 
doors following a devastating tornado and became a Red Cross command 
post, and adapted to COVID by offering a ``parking lot church&#x27;&#x27; and 
live streaming which continues to this day. Also during this time the 
congregation merged with its shared church Eastminster United 
Presbyterian Church so the two congregations now worship as one.
  For an astounding 150 years, St. Peter&#x27;s United Church of Christ 
lives up to the faith&#x27;s motto, John 17:21: ``That they may all be 
one.&#x27;&#x27; The church demonstrates this message while living Christ&#x27;s 
message of Love and being ``a welcoming place for all--no matter who 
you are or where you are on life&#x27;s journey.&#x27;&#x27; As today&#x27;s congregants 
celebrate this journey of 150 years, looking back with inspired 
recollection and renewed with a faith-filled purpose, we look forward 
to the next centuries of servant leadership in the community of 
Millbury and surrounding neighbors.

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Bank of 
Edmonson County for 100 years of service to its local community.
  Founded on October 5, 1925, by brothers Jesse, Luther, and David 
Alexander alongside business paltners George Woodcock and N.E. (Ed) 
Vincent, this local financial institution has served the residents of 
Edmonson County well for a century. Their foresight during the 1920&#x27;s, 
followed quickly by the trials of the Great Depression, laid the 
foundation for a community-focused institution that has not only 
endured but thrived. The Bank of Edmonson County has guided its 
customers through economic shifts, new technologies, and changing 
conditions with one main mission in mind: ensuring customers are its 
highest priority
  Established with the goal of building a local bank to serve as a 
pillar of trust and local investment, 100 years later, they continue to 
focus on supporting Edmonson County and the surrounding area 
faithfully.
  From its humble beginnings with just $15,000 in capital, the bank has 
grown into a $200 million enterprise, with locations in multiple 
counties in Kentucky. I congratulate the

       CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHRISTIAN EMBASSY

                                  _____
                                 

                        HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize and celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the Christian Embassy, a ministry that has faithfully 
served leaders in Washington, D.C. and around the world since 1975. I 
have had the privilege of being involved with Christian Embassy since I 
first came to the House of Representatives 28 years ago.
  For half a century, the Christian Embassy has stood as a spiritual 
resource to public servants, helping them discover the relevance of 
God&#x27;s truth in their personal and professional lives. This vital 
ministry began when government officials and business leaders, 
concerned for the spiritual health of Members of Congress and their 
spouses, invited Dr. Bill and Vonette Bright--founder and president of 
Campus Crusade for Christ International--to come to Washington to 
minister to the personal, private, and spiritual needs of those serving 
in public life.
  Over the years, the Christian Embassy&#x27;s ministry expanded to include 
the White House, Presidential Appointees, senior Pentagon civilian and 
military leaders, ambassadors, and their spouses and staff. From the 
beginning, God blessed this work. The evidence of His faithfulness is 
seen in the many leaders who have come to know Jesus Christ personally 
through the ministry, as well as in those who have grown in their 
faith, learned to share it with others, and discovered how to live a 
Spirit-empowered life even amid the pressures of leadership.
  The Christian Embassy&#x27;s outreach has included discipleship training, 
evangelism training, private prayer times, personal counseling, and 
both group and individual Bible studies. Through these efforts, the 
Christian Embassy has served Members of both Houses of Congress, White 
House officials, Presidential Appointees, senior military officers and 
civilians, and international diplomats.
  For over two decades, one of the most cherished programs of the 
Christian Embassy was the ``Washington Escape,&#x27;&#x27; an annual retreat that 
allowed Members of Congress, senior military leaders, political 
appointees, senior executives, ambassadors, and their spouses to step 
away from the demands of Washington for a time of rest and renewal. 
Renowned pastor and author Chuck Swindoll served as the master teacher 
for these retreats, which blessed countless participants with biblical 
wisdom and encouragement. My wife Caroline and I were honored to 
participate in some of these retreats over the years.
  I also want to highlight the leadership of Bobby Little, who has 
served as Executive Director of the Christian Embassy since 2007. Under 
his direction, the Christian Embassy has expanded its programs to 
strengthen the spiritual and relational foundations of leaders serving 
in Washington and around the world. Working alongside his lovely wife 
Sheila, Mr. Little has guided initiatives that provide discipleship, 
leadership development, and biblical training for Members of Congress, 
senior military officers, and diplomats. As someone who has known Bobby 
for many years and is currently in the bible study he leads, I know 
that his steady leadership has helped the Christian Embassy remain 
faithful to its mission--equipping and encouraging those in positions 
of influence to live out their faith and values with integrity and 
purpose.
  The Christian Embassy is nonpolitical and non-denominational, 
maintaining a singular vision: to minister to government leaders not 
only because of their personal needs, but also because of their 
influence as decision-makers shaping our Nation and the world.
  Mr. Speaker, I commend the Christian Embassy for 50 years of 
steadfast service to our leaders and our Nation, but mainly Christian 
Embassy&#x27;s service to the Lord Jesus Christ. As we mark this milestone, 
we give thanks for the countless lives touched by this ministry and for 
its continuing mission to honor God and serve those who serve others.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shineforth, 
formerly known as UMFS, on the occasion of its 125th anniversary of 
service to children, families, and communities across Virginia.
  Founded in 1900 as the Virginia Conference Orphanage, the 
organization has evolved over the past century to meet the changing 
needs of vulnerable children and families. From its earliest days, 
providing care and shelter for orphans, to its transformation into 
United Methodist Family Services, and now as Shineforth, the 
organization has remained steadfast in its mission: to create a world 
where all children can belong and thrive.
  Over the past 125 years, Shineforth has pioneered innovative services 
for children in foster care, those with special education needs, and 
youth facing behavioral health challenges. Its programs, including 
foster care and adoption services, residential treatment, community-
based support, and the Charterhouse School, have become a model of 
compassion, resilience, and evidence-based care.
  What has not changed is Shineforth&#x27;s unwavering belief in the worth 
and dignity of every child. Generations of families in Virginia have 
been strengthened because of the care, advocacy, and vision provided by 
this organization and its dedicated staff, volunteers, and supporters.
  As Shineforth celebrates this remarkable milestone, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring 125 years of transformative service. 
May the next century of Shineforth&#x27;s work continue to light the way 
forward for children and families in Virginia and beyond.

  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Special Olympics 
Virginia and the Law Enforcement Torch Run as they celebrate 40 years 
of extraordinary service to individuals with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities.
  For four decades, Special Olympics Virginia has provided year-round 
sports training and competition to thousands of athletes, empowering 
them to achieve their personal best while fostering inclusion, respect, 
and community engagement. Through these programs, athletes not only 
develop athletic skills but also gain confidence, leadership abilities, 
and lifelong friendships.
  The Law Enforcement Torch Run exemplifies the incredible partnership 
between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve. 
Officers across Virginia have carried the Flame of Hope, raising 
awareness and vital funds to support Special Olympics programs. This 
collaboration has helped break down barriers, build trust, and promote 
understanding for individuals with disabilities.
  As we celebrate this milestone, we recognize the dedication of 
athletes, coaches, volunteers, and law enforcement officers whose 
commitment has transformed the lives of countless Virginians. The 
legacy of Special Olympics Virginia and the Law Enforcement Torch Run 
is one of inclusion, compassion, and unwavering support for every 
athlete&#x27;s potential.
  I congratulate the Special Olympics Virginia and the Law Enforcement 
Torch Run on 40 years of service and in celebrating their continued 
impact on communities throughout our Commonwealth.

  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Franklin County&#x27;s 150th 
Anniversary.
  We stand on the proud shoulder of 150 years of history, celebrating 
the founding of Franklin County in 1875. Franklin County is a vibrant 
and resilient community, rich with heritage and heart.
  Named for Benjamin C. Franklin, the first judicial officer of the 
Republic of Texas, the county has always stood for justice, 
independence, and perseverance. From early state settlers to the 
citizens of today, Franklin County has been shaped by hard work, strong 
values, and deep roots.
  With scenic lakes, thriving agriculture, and local legends, Franklin 
County is a lot more than a pinpoint on a map. It is a community worth 
celebrating. The many days I have spent in Franklin County have been 
filled with incredible people who lead with service and compassion, and 
world-famous, East Texas hospitality.
  The county has balanced tradition and growth, by strengthening the 
community and promoting new economic development.
  As we honor the past, we look forward to a future filled with 
promise. Here&#x27;s to the next 150 years of Franklin County. May it 
continue to grow, inspire and shine as a beacon of East Texas. It is an 
honor to represent this community in Washington.
  God Bless Franklin County.

  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, it is my special privilege to recognize 
Dave Welihan of Jackson as the Veteran of the Month for October and 
honor him for his distinguished service to our great Nation.
  Dave courageously served in the U.S. Army from 1971 through 1974 and 
has been honorably awarded the National Defense Service Medal. Since 
returning home, Dave has dedicated his life to serving the veteran 
community and ensuring they have the resources and support they 
deserve. He was formerly a Veteran Service Officer in Jackson, where he 
helped those who have worn the uniform resolve their local, state, and 
federal benefit issues to ensure that they receive the benefits they 
have so rightfully earned.
  He also served as a commander of the American Legion Richard F. Smith 
Post 29 and worked as the Director of the Jackson County Veterans 
Affairs Office. While with the Jackson County VA, Dave helped 
coordinate the burial of five unclaimed veterans so that they could be 
honored and properly laid to rest, exemplifying his compassion for 
others. Dave and his wife even selflessly donated the flags used for 
the burial.
  Dave&#x27;s unwavering service, tireless commitment, and leadership have 
made a tangible difference. Through his many roles and daily actions, 
he has uplifted and advocated for his fellow veterans, serving as a 
guide, mentor, and friend. His legacy will not only live on in the 
hearts of those he has helped but also in the strong community he has 
helped build.
  May others know of my high regard for Dave, as well as my deep 
gratitude for his lasting contributions to the county we love.

  Mr. SORENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Chuck 
Collins, a broadcaster who has kept our district safe from storms for 
nearly a half century.
  Next week, 25News Chief Meteorologist Chuck Collins, will be walking 
away from the green screen. Chuck is a legend in the heart of Illinois, 
offering a calm voice that is trusted in the best weather and the worst 
storms.
  He grew up in Central Illinois and, I may know something about doing 
weather in your hometown, there&#x27;s almost nothing more rewarding. 
Chuck&#x27;s recognition will now live in the official Congressional Record 
for inspiring weather watchers, storm chasers, and other 
meteorologists. We will all be watching his final broadcast on October 
15, 2025.
  Today, I thank Chuck Collins for his decades of commitment to Central 
Illinois, and I extend my best wishes to him in retirement.

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Master 
Sergeant Shawn Worthen, United States Marine Corps, Retired, of 
Bensalem High School, who has been named the Marine Corps Junior 
Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (JROTC) Instructor of the Year for the 
past school year.
  The Bensalem Township School District is proud to celebrate this 
extraordinary accomplishment by one of its own. Master Sergeant Worthen 
proudly serves as the Leadership Studies and Marine Instructor, and 
exemplifies the highest standards of the United States Marine Corps. He 
consistently instills discipline, honor, and civic responsibility in 
his cadets each and every day.
  This recognition is awarded annually to the very best instructors 
from all Marine Corps JROTC programs nationwide. With approximately 500 
Marine Corps JROTC instructors serving across the country, being 
selected for this distinction is a remarkable and well-deserved honor. 
It reflects not only Master Sergeant Worthen&#x27;s professionalism and 
excellence in teaching, but also his profound commitment to shaping the 
character and leadership potential of America&#x27;s youth.
  Through his example, Master Sergeant Worthen continues to inspire 
students at Bensalem High School to live by the Marine Corps values of 
honor, courage, and commitment. These values that will guide them as 
they become future leaders in their communities and beyond.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join the Bensalem Township School

Shawn Worthen on this outstanding achievement. His dedication to his

                      RECOGNIZING DR. BRUCE SIEGEL

                                  _____
                                 

                        HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Dr. Bruce Siegel on his retirement after an extraordinary career as a 
leader in public health, hospital administration, and health policy. 
Bruce has spent his entire career advocating on behalf of our Nation&#x27;s 
most at-risk populations and the providers that care for them. For the 
past 14 years he has led America&#x27;s Essential Hospitals, formerly the 
National Association of Public Hospitals, championing the cause of 
mission-driven safety net hospitals that serve communities facing the 
greatest social and financial barriers to care.
  During Dr. Siegel&#x27;s tenure, he led efforts to preserve the 340B Drug 
Pricing Program, secured targeted safety-net hospital funding during 
the COVID-19 pandemic, and fought to close Medicaid payment gaps. He 
was instrumental in stopping harmful cuts to Medicaid DSH funding. 
Perhaps most notably, Dr. Siegel spearheaded a national campaign to 
incorporate social risk factors into federal value-based purchasing 
programs--an important step toward recognizing and addressing health 
disparities in policy and practice.
  Dr. Siegel&#x27;s medical career began after graduating from the Joan &amp; 
Sanford I. Weill Medical College of Cornell University and reflects a 
deep commitment to public service and health equity. From his early 
days as New Jersey&#x27;s Commissioner of Health to his leadership of NYC 
Health+Hospitals and Tampa General Hospital, and later as a professor 
and director at The George Washington University, Dr. Siegel has 
consistently worked to improve care for the most vulnerable among us, 
performing pioneering research into health care quality, health care 
disparities, and the safety net. He has had a significant and positive 
impact on our health care system, and his contributions will be sorely 
missed.
  Mr. Speaker, my staff and I thank Dr. Siegel for his tireless 
dedication and leadership. His legacy will continue to inspire future 
generations of health care advocates and public servants.

RECOGNIZING THE 350TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARTYRDOM OF GURU TEGH BAHADUR

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 
the 350th anniversary of the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the 
revered Ninth Guru of Sikhism--the world&#x27;s fifth-largest religion, with 
nearly 30 million followers worldwide, including one million here in 
the United States.
  A champion of religious freedom for all, Guru Tegh Bahadur 
courageously confronted the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s campaign of 
religious persecution, defending the right of every individual to 
freely practice their faith. For this act of unwavering conviction, he 
was publicly executed in 1675 in Delhi, India, and is fondly remembered 
as Dharam Di Chadar, or, ``Shield of the Religions,&#x27;&#x27; for his ultimate 
sacrifice to protect the rights of others and uphold the universal 
principles of human dignity, freedom of conscience, and the right to 
worship according to one&#x27;s beliefs.
  Pennsylvania&#x27;s Sikh community, whose roots trace back to the State of 
Punjab in India, began immigrating to our Nation more than a century 
ago. These remarkable Americans have played a vital role in the growth 
and vitality of the Keystone State and have enriched their communities 
through their commitment to tolerance, service, and civic engagement.
  These extraordinary ideals reflect the Sikh tradition of seeking 
peace through equality, fraternity, and respect, while striving to 
overcome division through sacred teachings and the admirable tenets of 
honest work, charity, volunteerism, and sharing with those in need.
  Mr. Speaker, it is altogether fitting that the House recognize Guru 
Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s supreme sacrifice for human rights and religious 
freedom, and encourage all Americans to join in its observance on 
November 24, 2025.

     RECOGNIZING THE UKRAINIAN AMERICAN SPORT CENTER TRYZUB&#x27;S 75TH 
                              ANNIVERSARY

                                  _____
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
extraordinary group of individuals from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1st 
Congressional District--an organization that has gone above and beyond 
the call of duty in service to both our community and our country. It 
is with great respect and admiration I recognize the Ukrainian American 
Sports Center Tryzub&#x27;s 75th anniversary.
  Such honorable individuals are not defined by titles or accolades but 
by the quiet power of their actions. They are distinguished by their 
unwavering integrity, the strength of their character, and their 
steadfast commitment to the people and places they serve. They are the 
foundation upon which our communities stand--the ones who lift others 
up, inspire hope, and, in doing so, call us all to higher standards of 
service and compassion. Throughout their years helping the community, 
the UASC Tryzub embodies this spirit of honor in ways that words can 
scarcely capture.
  Founded in Philadelphia by displaced World War II Ukrainian 
immigrants, the UASC Tryzub became an important part of the community. 
The UASC Tryzub organized teams of all sports to play in various 
leagues in Philadelphia, as well as gave the Ukrainian American

[[Page E953]]

community a nourishing environment with personal and professional 
support. The goals of the UASC Tryzub align with preserving history, 
culture, tradition, and Ukrainian sport (specifically professional 
soccer). Their home-base in Horsham township continues to be a center 
where the community comes together. Some notable achievements of the 
UASC Tryzub include in 1856 the Club&#x27;s Majors&#x27; Division soccer team 
reached the national championship game for the coveted US Amateur Cup. 
A year later the UASC Tryzub organized a professional soccer franchise; 
the Philadelphia Ukrainian Nationals, which generated many professional 
championships onto the City of Philadelphia. These achievements, along 
with many others, brought a downpour of glory and attention to 
Philadelphia from the international soccer world.
  Today, 56 teams and 800 athletes, known as the ``Ukie Nation&#x27;&#x27; 
proudly wear blue and yellow and play under the Philadelphia Ukrainian 
Nationals Banner. Travel and club teams, including all skill levels, 
are offered for boys and girls all year round. The UASC Tryzub is not 
only notable for their achievements, but for giving back to the 
community. The players develop and improve not only their soccer skills 
but their personal goals as well. Through scholarships, volunteering, 
and community efforts to preserve Ukrainian heritage and bring 
awareness to those in need, the Tryzub continues to support and grow 
the Ukrainian American community.
  In times of need, their service is a testament to the belief that an 
individual&#x27;s dedication can ripple through the lives of many, sparking 
change, fostering resilience, and inspiring hope. Today, we honor the 
UASC Tryzub not just for their remarkable deeds but for fostering an 
incredible community.
  Mr. Speaker, their actions remind us that progress is not forged in 
grand gestures but in the cumulative power of selfless acts. They 
embody the timeless American values of resilience, generosity, and 
compassion, showing us that the future is built by those who care 
deeply, act decisively, and give without hesitation.
  On behalf of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1st Congressional District, I extend my 
appreciation and recognition to the UASC Tryzub for their extraordinary 
service of 75 years. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the 
UASC Tryzub&#x27;s 75th anniversary, which will inspire generations to come. 
May their example remind us of the boundless potential within each of 
us to make our communities, country, and world a better place.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 10, 2025

  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to 
His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Spiritual Head 
of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the second largest Christian Church in 
the world. It is a distinct honor for our Nation&#x27;s Capital to host such 
a revered global religious leader whose life&#x27;s work has been defined by 
faith, peace, and reconciliation.
  His All-Holiness has long been a tireless advocate for interfaith 
dialogue, human rights, religious freedom, and environmental 
stewardship. For decades, he has traveled the world promoting 
understanding and respect among faith traditions and urging us to 
safeguard our common home for future generations. His spiritual 
leadership has touched the lives of millions of Orthodox Christians and 
countless others across the globe.
  I am especially proud to represent the Saints Constantine and Helen 
Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Richmond, Virginia, a vibrant and

[[Page E952]]

faithful community that stands as a testament to the Orthodox 
tradition&#x27;s rich history and enduring presence in America. Their 
commitment to faith, service, and fellowship reflects the very values 
His All-Holiness has championed throughout his ministry.
  On behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Virginia, I welcome 
His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington and 
extend deep gratitude for his lifelong dedication to promoting peace, 
unity, and justice in our world.
