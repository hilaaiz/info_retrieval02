                       HONORING ANGELA Y. CARSON

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, May 14, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Ms. Angela Y. Carson, a dedicated leader and community advocate, for 
her outstanding service as Executive Director of Pine Grove 
Association, Inc., a nonprofit organization based in Canton, 
Mississippi.
  Founded in 1992 by Rufus and Aggie Carson, Pine Grove Association has 
been a cornerstone of the Canton community for over three decades. The 
organization is rooted in a mission of empowering individuals and 
families by fostering mobility, advocating for social justice, and 
promoting diversity and inclusion.
  Under Ms. Carson&#x27;s visionary leadership, Pine Grove Association 
continues to offer impactful programs and services that serve both 
youth and adults. Among these is the Madison Area Global Innovation 
Collaborative (MAGIC), a transformative initiative designed to promote 
global learning opportunities for middle school students. Through 
education and innovation, MAGIC equips the next generation with the 
skills, values, and global perspective necessary for success in an 
increasingly interconnected world.
  The mission of Pine Grove Association--to empower individuals through 
value-centered leadership, talent development, and community well-
being--remains steadfast. Ms. Carson has further advanced this mission 
by exploring cutting-edge strategies, including the integration of 
artificial intelligence (AI) to scale the organization&#x27;s operations. 
Her goals include developing a scalable business model, optimizing 
internal processes through AI applications, and preparing for future 
funding through AI-driven data analysis.
  Ms. Carson&#x27;s commitment to innovation and equity in community 
building exemplifies the forward-thinking leadership that uplifts and 
transforms lives. Through her stewardship, Pine Grove Association 
remains a beacon of empowerment and inclusion for the citizens of 
Canton and surrounding communities.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Angela Y. 
Carson for her tireless work and in celebrating the ongoing impact of 
Pine Grove Association, Inc. on the lives of Mississippians.

                          ____________________

        HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF DETROIT MEMORIAL PARK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RASHIDA TLAIB

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, May 14, 2025

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors 
the 100th anniversary of Detroit Memorial Park, Michigan&#x27;s oldest 
Black-owned cemetery and a beacon of dignity, justice, and community 
for generations.
  Founded in 1925 by visionary Black leaders Charles C. Diggs, Sr. and 
Aaron C. Toodle, Detroit Memorial Park was born out of necessity, at a 
time when Black families in Detroit were denied basic dignity in 
burial. These trailblazers cleared sacred ground where all people, 
regardless of race or faith, could be laid to rest with respect.
  From offering fresh vegetables to families during the Depression to 
providing low-cost transportation for mourners, Detroit Memorial Park 
has always led with care and compassion. Today, with cemeteries in 
Warren, Redford, and Flint, they continue this legacy across over 170 
acres. As we celebrate this historic milestone, I offer my deepest 
gratitude to Detroit Memorial Park for a century of unwavering service 
and dignity.
  The 12th District honors the Detroit Memorial Park and celebrates 
this momentous occasion for our community.

                 HONORING THE HMONG AMERICAN COMMUNITY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, May 14, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Hmong American 
community and commemorate May 14, 2025, as Hmong American Day, marking 
50 years since the first Hmong families began their journey to the 
United States following the fall of Long Cheng in 1975. On this day, we 
recognize the legacy of service, sacrifice, and strength that defines 
the Hmong American experience.
  From 1961 to 1975, more than 40,000 Hmong men and boys--many under 
the age of 18--were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to 
fight in the Secret War in Laos, a critical but often overlooked 
chapter of the Vietnam War. Fighting alongside American forces, Hmong 
soldiers risked everything to defend freedom and combat the spread of 
communism in Southeast Asia. Following the end of the war, they and 
their families faced persecution and displacement, forcing thousands to 
flee Laos.
  On May 14, 1975, the final airlift evacuated Hmong soldiers and their 
families from Laos to refugee camps in Thailand. From there, many 
resettled in the United States, including in California&#x27;s Central 
Valley, where they rebuilt their lives with determination and hope. 
Today, communities like Clovis, Fresno, and Sacramento are home to some 
of the largest and most vibrant Hmong populations in the country. These 
families have contributed to the fabric of American society in 
countless ways by serving as educators, healthcare professionals, 
entrepreneurs, public servants, and community leaders.
  We especially honor the Hmong veterans and their families, whose 
courage and loyalty to the United States must never be forgotten. Their 
stories remind us of the price of freedom and the enduring strength of 
the human spirit.
  I commend the County of Fresno, the City of Clovis, and other local 
governments for formally recognizing Hmong American Day and paying 
tribute to the history, culture, and contributions of the Hmong people. 
I join them in encouraging all Americans to learn more about this rich 
legacy and to celebrate the extraordinary impact of Hmong Americans on 
our communities and our country.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, May 14, 2025

  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 
Polynesian Association of Alaska (PAOA), a non-profit organization that 
is celebrating their 20th Anniversary. Over the span of two decades, 
this organization has committed itself to educating Pacific Islanders 
across various domains, including health and social services, 
employment, culture, language, voting, education, immigration, and 
more.
  PAOA was founded on November 16, 2004, in Anchorage, Alaska, 
following a Samoan Computer Language Senior Class led by Lusiana Tuga 
Hansen. This non-profit entity was formally established and registered 
in the City of Anchorage and the State of Alaska on February 1, 2005, 
and achieved 501(c)(3) status on June 16, 2006. Since its 
establishment, it has functioned as the leading organization for the 
Pacific Island community in Alaska from 2005 to 2025.

[[Page E428]]

  PAOA&#x27;s mission is to empower and educate individuals and families 
while promoting pride and acceptance of all cultures and instilling the 
best values they embody. The organization currently has 53 registered 
members and 19 Board Members. Their vision is to ensure that the 
Pacific Island community in Alaska and beyond receives support in 
education, employment, and cultural enrichment. I want to thank the 
group for their continued dedication to Polynesian cultural and 
community values in Alaska and for their contributions to the Pacific 
Islands region at large.

                        Wednesday, May 14, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Mary ``Adams&#x27;&#x27; Adamczewski has made to our community 
as a volunteer with People Helping People (PHP) as its Treasurer of the 
Board of Directors since 2016. Her budgeting and accounting skills 
alone make her a wonderful addition to PHP, but she brings so much 
more. Mary&#x27;s heart for helping those who are hungry is huge. She is at 
PHP&#x27;s HELP Center nearly every day it&#x27;s open, cooking, preparing, and 
serving food to the thousands of neighbors the organization feeds each 
year. This woman can make a meal out of typical pantry items that 
tastes gourmet. In addition to weekdays, you can count on Mary to be at 
the facility almost every Sunday, along with a loyal team of other 
volunteers, ensuring those that are unhoused or unable to afford much 
food receive a wonderful, hot meal. In addition to those who enjoy the 
sit-down meals on Sunday, she makes sure that two families with a 
combined total of nearly two dozen children also receive a nutritious 
and delicious Sunday meal. Because of the length of time she&#x27;s been 
with PHP and her deep involvement with PHP&#x27;s mission, Mary also serves 
as an ``unofficial&#x27;&#x27; historian. Mary digs in with whatever needs to be 
done, even making the weekly run to the Recycling Center with the 
recyclables accumulated at PHP. And there&#x27;s more. If a client needs a 
haircut, Mary brings her electric razor, and in no time, someone has a 
fresh new look. One of PHP&#x27;s long-time clients was recently 
hospitalized. He had no family but he and Mary had a special 
relationship, and he considered her his ``family&#x27;&#x27;. Mary was the one to 
visit him in his final days and made sure that he was well taken care 
of to the end. Another gentleman is not only unhoused, but has 
Huntington&#x27;s Disease. Mary assists him with making sure he always has 
food and other necessities, and takes him to his medical appointments. 
Her kindness and energy knows no bounds. She is respected by everyone 
at PHP and wears so many different hats. Mary does all this with the 
support of her loving family.
  It is clear Mary ``Adams&#x27;&#x27; Adamczewski has made a profoundly positive 
impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all 
strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

        RECOGNIZING MAY AS HUNTINGTON&#x27;S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, May 14, 2025

  Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as 
Huntington&#x27;s Disease Awareness Month. I want to take a moment to honor 
the courage and strength of families across the Nation who face 
lifelong hardships due to this disease--including one of my own 
constituents, Rachel Reising, and her family. It is so important for 
families like Rachel&#x27;s for us to encourage dialogue and acknowledgement 
of Huntington&#x27;s Disease so we can work to improve prevention and care 
of affected folks at the federal level.
  Huntington&#x27;s disease is a rare genetic disorder that slowly damages 
the brain over time. It leads to a progressive loss of control over 
movements, thoughts, and emotions. There is currently no cure. However, 
there is hope. Because of ongoing advancements in medical research and 
continued investments in biomedical science, we are closer than ever to 
the possibility of breakthrough treatments and perhaps even a cure in 
the decade ahead through gene therapy.
  Rachel, my constituent, recently reached out to me to bravely share 
her story. As she grieves the loss of her father, whom she tragically 
lost to Huntington&#x27;s, it has become her life&#x27;s mission to advocate for 
proper care of those with Huntington&#x27;s and for a cure. I am so moved by 
her strength and resilience.
  In honor of Rachel&#x27;s family and the tens of thousands of others who 
face Huntington&#x27;s Disease, I am proud to lend my voice to this cause. 
May this month serve not only as a time of remembrance and education, 
but also a call to action. I ask my colleagues to do everything we can 
to help those living with rare diseases such as Huntington&#x27;s Disease, 
and to fight for more research, better support, and even greater care.

                          ____________________
