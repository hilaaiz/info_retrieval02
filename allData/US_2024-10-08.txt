  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, I, along with the people of St. Louis, rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Officer David Lee III, a loving and 
committed husband, father, brother, son, and friend. On behalf of 
Missouri&#x27;s First District, I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, 
Tonya Lee, son, Khalil Lee, daughter, Saniya Lee, mother, Dorothy 
Williams, father, David Lee II, brother, Dane Lee, sisters, Danielle 
Williams and Kimberly Lee, and countless other family, friends, and 
loved ones.
  Born and raised in the City of St. Louis and a graduate of 
Pattonville High School, Officer David Lee III dedicated his life to 
the service of others by entering the St. Louis Police Training Academy 
in November 2005. After being promoted to officer in 2007, David went 
above and beyond receiving the St. Louis Metropolitan Police 
Department&#x27;s Award of Excellence on three separate occasions. His 
dedication to his community was recognized through a Chief&#x27;s Letter of 
Commendation, and he was honored as Officer of the Month.
  Officer David Lee III, was a hero to his fellow officers and 
neighbors in the 6th and 7th precincts, and truly beloved by all who 
knew him. He took care of his family and the people of St. Louis--never 
wavering in his duty as an officer in a city he loved and called home. 
To his wife, Tonya, he was a special person with a heart of gold and an 
infectious smile. Officer David Lee III&#x27;s dedication to the St. Louis 
community will forever be etched into a history of extraordinary 
service in Missouri&#x27;s First District. May his memory be a blessing to 
us all.

Fire Lieutenant (Lt.) Brian Peek, who tragically passed away in the 
Line of Duty while serving as a member of the Goldsboro Fire Company.
  Lt. Peek was a gift and blessing to our community throughout his more

mentoring new members, and was tirelessly committed to the Station and 
to the Citizens it serves. He will be greatly missed by all who knew 
him or were blessed to share his life even in a small way.
  Lt. Peek served as Fire Lt. 68-3, Fire Police Lt. 68, and Fire Police

family--two sons, two stepsons, his brother, and 18 grandchildren--who

  Mr. Speaker I&#x27;m saddened, honored, and humbled to recognize Fire 
Lieutenant Brian Peek on his tireless, selfless, and unwavering service

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, I, along with the people of St. Louis, rise to 
celebrate and honor the life and legacy of Theodore Raymond Drewes, Jr. 
The name Ted Drewes is synonymous with summer in St. Louis. For 
generations, Ted Drewes Frozen Custard has brought joy and sweet 
memories to Missouri&#x27;s First District.
  In 1930, tennis star Ted Drewes, Sr. debuted his first St. Louis 
Frozen Custard stand on Natural Bridge Road, later opening two 
locations that still serve St. Louisans and visitors alike on South 
Grand Boulevard and Chippewa Street. As a child, Ted Drewes Jr. often 
appeared in the family&#x27;s custard stands advertisements with the tagline 
``It really is good guys, and gals!&#x27;&#x27; Ted Drewes, Jr. fully embraced 
the family business working 80 hours a week between stands and making 
it the beloved St. Louis institution we crave. Like many across St. 
Louis, on a hot summer day, I have cooled down with my two favorite Ted 
Drewes staples: The Christy or a Strawberry Concrete.
  Ted not only loved frozen custard, but he was also an accomplished 
rifleman, speed roller skater, and table tennis player. He valued using 
philanthropy to further customer service and community service, 
particularly through supporting his church, Historic Trinity Lutheran 
Church in Soulard, and the St. Louis Area Foodbank.
  I offer my deepest condolences on behalf of Missouri&#x27;s First District 
to his wife Dorothy Jane Drewes, daughters Christy Dillon and Cynthia 
Verseman, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the many people and 
community members who loved him.

               HONORING THE LIFE OF PASTOR CHARLES DAVIS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KATHY CASTOR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 8, 2024

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart 
to honor the life of Superintendent Charles Davis of College Hill 
Church of God in Christ (COGIC). Pastor Davis was a pillar in the Tampa 
Bay community and beloved by all who knew him or had the opportunity to 
join him in prayer. He leaves behind a legacy of servant leadership 
that should inspire neighbors across the Tampa Bay area for decades to 
come.
  Charles Davis was born in St. Petersburg, FL as the ninth of ten 
children to Willie and Dorothea Davis. The family moved to Tampa in 
1949. Pastor Davis graduated from H.W. Blake High School in 1959 and 
from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in 1963 with a 
Bachelor of Science in Education. Superintendent Davis met Deloris 
Longworth, and they were married in December 1966. He embarked on a 
career of public service, education and as a faith leader.
  The Church of God in Christ has been a part of the Tampa community 
for over 100 years. From the years of 1964 to 1997, COGIC was pastored 
by Bishop W.E. Davis, Superintendent Charles Davis&#x27;s father. At age 
twenty-five, Charles decided to dedicate himself to God and lead a life 
as a leader in the church. In 1997, the membership requested that Elder 
Charles Davis be appointed as The Pastor of COGIC. Under the leadership 
of Superintendent Davis, COGIC has continued to thrive.
  Superintendent Davis served COGIC in almost every level of 
ordination, including Deacon and Elder. He served as Pastor, Sunday 
School teacher, chairman of the Administrative Board and Chairman of 
the Elders Council of the Jurisdiction of Southwestern Florida. His 
most beloved role was serving in the youth department as Jurisdictions 
Young People Willing Workers (YPWW) President.
  Outside of COGIC, Superintendent Davis was bigger than life and very 
active in the Tampa civic community. He was the Coordinator of 
Childcare and Head Start in Hillsborough County, a Hillsborough County 
Community Action Agency Director and Martin Luther King Scholarship 
Fund Board Member, a member of the Tampa NAACP and Tampa Urban League. 
Superintendent Davis also held many special appointments, including the 
Mayor&#x27;s Community Awareness Task Force, Florida Bar Grievance Committee 
and the Thirteenth Judicial and State Board Member of One Church One 
Child, appointed by the Governor.
  Pastor Davis loved his family more than anything, and is survived by 
his wife, Deloris

[[Page E1020]]

Longworth Davis, and their four daughters, Charlotte, LaTonia and her 
husband Brian, Karin and her husband Ron, and Amber and her husband 
William. He is also survived by his eight grandchildren, Trimonte, 
LaRon, Jordan, Charles, Avery, Ja&#x27;lyn, Jayden, Charli and six great-
grandchildren. His memory will also live on through his godchildren, 
nieces, nephews, cousins, friends, and the College Hill COGIC 
community.
  Pastor Davis always had a twinkle in his eye, a kind word and made 
our community more gracious. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my Tampa Bay 
area neighbors and all Floridians, I am proud to honor Superintendent 
Charles Davis for his lifelong dedication to others, and his kind, 
loving service to all. We are eternally grateful for his immense 
contributions.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 8, 2024

  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize International Plasma 
Awareness Week (IPAW) from October 7-11 and celebrate the three million 
plasma donors whose gift saves the lives of more than 120,000 Americans 
with rare diseases. Plasma protein therapies, including recombinant 
analogs and plasma-derived therapies, increase life expectancy, improve 
quality of life, and reduce life-threatening complications for people 
living with rare, life-threatening, chronic, and genetic diseases.
  Plasma--the straw-colored, liquid portion of blood--contains proteins 
necessary for carrying out critical functions in the human body. For 
example, immunoglobulins also known as antibodies defend your body from 
infections and fight disease, and clotting factors regulate bleeding. 
If a person has insufficient levels of any one plasma protein, their 
body cannot carry out these vital functions, causing a variety of 
chronic and life-threatening medical conditions.
  Many people living with rare, life-threatening, chronic, and genetic 
diseases, like primary immunodeficiency, neurological disorders, 
hereditary angioedema, pulmonary disorders, bleeding disorders, and 
infectious diseases such as tetanus, hepatitis, and rabies, rely on 
plasma-derived treatments. Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, plasma 
protein therapies cannot be synthesized in a laboratory. Plasma and its 
lifesaving proteins can only be obtained via human plasma from a donor.
  As the co-chair of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus, I 
understand how critical plasma donors and donation centers are in 
saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans with rare 
diseases. This is why in 2020, I introduced the Continuing Access to 
In-Home IVIG Act which extends and expands access to Intravenous 
Immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment administered in the home for Medicare 
patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. This was subsequently 
included in the 2021 government funding package and enacted into law. 
More recently, I introduced the PI Post Acute Access Act, which would 
expand IVIG treatment access to Medicare beneficiaries with primary 
immunodeficiencies living in skilled nursing facilities.
  Without plasma donors who make more than 47 million plasma donations 
annually at over 1,100 International Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) 
certified plasma collection centers, countless patients would be unable 
to access these lifesaving therapies. That&#x27;s why International Plasma 
Awareness Week is held annually each October to raise global awareness 
about source plasma collection, recognize the valued contributions of 
donors, and increase understanding about plasma protein therapies and 
the rare diseases they treat.
  I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating International Plasma 
Awareness Week (IPAW) and recognizing plasma donors and donation 
centers for their heroic and lifesaving contributions.

  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize Kern Energy on 
their 90-year anniversary and to thank them for their significant 
contributions to the Central Valley. Kern Energy, established in 1934, 
is an independent, family-owned and operated transportation fuel 
producer in the Southern San Joaquin Valley. For nine decades, Kern

Kern Energy has been a leader of energy innovation, consistently 
overcoming California&#x27;s operational challenges. Kern Energy is 
dedicated to advancing cleaner transportation fuels by investing in 
innovative solutions for future generations. The company&#x27;s unwavering 
commitment to meeting the ever-changing energy needs of California has 
guided their mission for nearly a century. Kern Energy has adopted the 
motto of ``small but mighty&#x27;&#x27; to reflect their significant impact on 
the community. Kern Energy has

[[Page E1021]]

been a steadfast partner to the Central Valley and California, 
supporting the growth and progress of the region. It is because of the 
hard work of Kern Energy and their employees that Valley families, 
small businesses, and producers have the fuel they need to thrive.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in celebrating Kern Energy on their 90-year anniversary. Their 
work to provide the Central Valley with reliable, clean energy will be 
felt for generations to come. I wish them continued success in the

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest 
congratulations to KABC-TV as it celebrates its 75th anniversary of 
broadcasting.
  Launched on September 16, 1949 as KECA-TV on Channel 7, ABC&#x27;s fifth 
television outlet and Los Angeles&#x27; seventh television station, the 7:00 
p.m. premiere featured a program with civic leaders and a variety 
program, followed by a University of California Los Angeles-Oregon 
State University football game. On February 1, 1954, the callsign of 
KECA-TV was changed to KABC-TV. Since then, KABC-TV has established 
itself as one of the premier local news and information sources in 
Southern California, flourishing along with the City of Los Angeles as 
the area&#x27;s population grew during the post-war years. The station was 
originally located in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles until 
2000 when it moved to its current home in Glendale. Since its 
conception, the station has been instrumental in shaping public 
discourse, providing a platform for local issues, and celebrating the 
diverse communities of Los Angeles.
  With a team of well-versed and dedicated news anchors and reporters, 
the station delivers compelling news stories that are relevant and 
important to Angelenos, communicating complex issues with clarity and 
empathy. KABC-TV&#x27;s news anchors have been consistently described as 
approachable, authentic, and exceptionally skilled in their roles. 
Throughout challenging times such as the Covid-19 pandemic, turbulent 
local politics, and devasting wildfires, these award-winning anchors 
and reporters have served as accurate, reliable stewards of 
information.
  In the era of rapid technological change, KABC-TV has been at the 
forefront of innovation in digital and social media engagement, 
embracing the evolving media landscape and adapting its skillful 
strategies to connect with audiences across the region. This commitment 
to modernization ensures that Southern California and Los Angeles in 
particular, receive timely and significant news, through televisions, 
accessing content via their phones, or through social media platforms.
  KABC-TV has garnered numerous accolades, including many Emmy Awards 
from the Los Angeles Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences.
  I am proud to recognize this outstanding station for its enduring 
legacy and immeasurable contributions to the television and news 
industry in our local communities. I ask all Members to join me in 
congratulating KABC-TV Los Angeles upon its 75th anniversary.
