I congratulate Dr. Dave 
Olson, President and Program Manager at Savannah River Mission 
Completion (SRMC), upon retirement after more than 40 years of 
dedicated work and service.
  Before being named President and Program Manager, Dr. Olson served as 
the president of the former Savannah River Site (SRS) liquid waste 
contractor. He has years of experience in safety, security, project and 
risk management, maintenance and engineering in nuclear materials 
processing, and much more.
  SRMC is responsible for the safe reduction of curies in aging waste 
tanks at SRS. As one of the Department of Energys largest production 
sites, SRS performs actives ranging from environmental cleanup and 
protection to nuclear materials storage and disposition.
  Under the leadership of Dr. Olson, SRMC has worked more than 21 
million hours without an injury that has caused a missed worked day, 
ensured that all facilities are operating safely and efficiently, and 
met five key regulatory milestones to remove waste from and clean tanks 
to prepare them for operational closure.
.
  Best wishes for a wonderful retirement. I am appreciative for all he 
has done for South Carolina.
I rise today to celebrate six 
decades of the Aquarium of Niagara. An interactive water exhibit that 
celebrates the natural wonders of our aquatic world and provides a 
deeper educational understanding of our diverse ecosystems, the 
Aquarium is a gem of Western New Yorks cultural and educational 
institutions.
  The Aquarium of Niagara was one of the first of its kind. Founded in 
1965 by a small group of chemists and scientists, it served as a 
successful model for inland aquariums around the world. Upon its 
opening, it became the first inland aquarium to develop and use 
artificial seawater to maintain exhibits; this sparked a revolutionary 
practice now used in most inland aquariums.
  Located in Niagara Falls, New York, the Aquarium of Niagara welcomes 
over 200,000 visitors each year and is the only aquatic museum within 
250 miles of the United States. They serve as a hub for educating the 
community on aquatic life, consisting of two buildings and housing 180 
species. Visitors come to see an array of mammals, penguins, and more 
than 1,200 fish and vertebrae, many of those being rescued species. 
Additionally, they provide guests with visual experiences to explore 
all of their marine life exhibits. There is a variety of scheduled 
programming offered daily as well as hands-on experiences that create 
inspiring opportunities for visitors.
  Today, we honor one of Western New Yorks one-of-a-kind 
establishments and its commitment to bringing the wonders of the seas 
to visitors from around the world while providing the highest quality 
of animal care possible. Please join me in celebrating the 60th 
anniversary of the Aquarium of Niagara and their achievements and 
continued success as they remain an enduring source of connection to 
marine life for generations to come.
I rise to recognize Pamela Ott on the 
occasion of her retirement after more than two decades of distinguished 
service to the City of Pleasanton, California.

  Throughout her career, Pamela has played a vital role in shaping 
Pleasantons economic development. She led major business recruitment 
efforts that brought transformative companies such as Workday, 10x 
Genomics, and Veeva Systems to the city. Her work on the Johnson Drive 
Economic Development Zone helped deliver a vibrant new commercial hub, 
including a Costco and two new hotels.
  When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Pamela took swift action to 
support local businesses by designing and implementing innovative 
recovery programs that helped them stay afloat and connected to their 
customers. Her leadership was essential during a time of great 
uncertainty and change.
  As a Pleasanton resident since 2001, Pamela has been more than a 
public servant, she has been a dedicated neighbor, a compassionate 
leader, and a steadfast champion for her community. As she steps into 
retirement, I offer my deepest gratitude for her service and wish her 
all the best as she is afforded more time with her husband, Jim, and 
daughters, Melissa and Kelsey.

last week the Republican Majority in the 
House of Representatives decided that they know better than the 
residents of the District of Columbia what their local government 
needs.
  All Members of Congress are sent here by our constituents to 
represent their interests, and to vote on matters of federal 
importance. We arent sent here to rule on specific local ordinances or 
funding decisions made by the cities and counties in any of our 
districts. Yet Republicans have brought three bills to the floor--H.R. 
884, H.R. 2056, and H.R. 2096--to do exactly that. They want to tell 
the District of Columbias 700,000 residents that the laws and policies 
they have voted for, and that were crafted by their local elected 
officials, are null and void.
, none of us ran for or were elected to serve as D.C. 
Council members. Ive been a city council member. Its a very different 
job, with a direct line of responsibility to the residents who elect 
you to deal with everything from potholes to public safety. That local 
representation and local responsiveness is a key part of our democracy, 
and Republicans are proposing to strip that local self-governance away 
from the residents of the District of Columbia.
  If Republicans want to take steps to address an issue with national 
importance, they can bring forward a bill that enforces it nationally. 
I will not vote for these attempts to decide those issues for a single 
district at the local level, whether in the District of Columbia or in 
the districts of any Member here.
  One of the bills before us last week, H.R. 884, would repeal D.C.s 
local law that allows

noncitizens to vote in local elections. I have serious concerns with 
allowing noncitizens who do not hold a green card to vote in local 
elections, but this is the wrong way to go about addressing that. I 
voted present because I cant support repealing a local D.C. law, but I 
do support having a conversation about how we define voter eligibility 
nationwide.
  I voted No on H.R. 2096, the Protecting Our Nations Capital 
Emergency Act, because it would repeal part of a local D.C. law to give 
the police department increased authority to address incidents of 
serious misconduct and discipline officers. I voted No on H.R. 2056 
because we shouldnt be nullifying a local law to tell an individual 
police department where they must divert their resources and how they 
can best serve their community, including residents who are immigrants.
, I respect the will of D.C. residents to shape their 
local government through their local elections, and that is why I do 
not support H.R. 2096, H.R. 2056 or H.R. 884.
today I rise to recognize Mr. MyoungSub Choi 
for his exceptional efforts to preserve and share cultural heritage

North Texas to embrace both the physical and philosophical dimensions 
of the sport.
  By nurturing discipline and pride within a diverse community, Mr. 
Choi has built a lasting legacy. His work during the 23rd Annual Korean 
American National Sports Festival is a testament to his enduring 
commitment to cultural celebration and civic unity.
  We commend Mr. Choi for using sport as a bridge across generations 
and communities.
today I rise to honor Mr. Sangho Ko, Vice 
President of the Dallas Taekwondo Association, for his steadfast 
dedication to Taekwondo as a vehicle for cultural diplomacy and 
community empowerment.
a cultural bridge that fosters mutual understanding 
and global citizenship. His work has nurtured countless students who 
carry with them the values of humility, cooperation, and perseverance.
  His leadership in the 23rd Annual Korean American National Sports 
Festival helped showcase the richness of Korean culture and the 
unifying power of sport.
  We thank Mr. Ko for his vision, his commitment to excellence, and his 
role in bringing communities together through shared purpose.
it is a privilege to rise today to 
recognize Mr. Theodore Gomez for his service at Withlacoochee River 
Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up 
Navajo Project. In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled 
over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New 
Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical 
infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for 
generations. Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to 
communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark, 
families to preserve

food, and elders to live with greater comfort. Despite daunting 
challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team completed a demanding 
project in just eight days--far ahead of expectations--demonstrating 
professionalism, humility, and unwavering commitment to this life-
changing mission.
  The impact of WRECs work goes far beyond electricity; it represents 
a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future 
generations to their ancestral homes. The emotional moment when power 
was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and 
renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project 
made. WRECs participation in the ``Light Up Navajo initiative 
reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and 
respect for the people they serve. Their dedication has energized ten 
homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that 
embodies the true spirit of cooperative values. The WREC teams journey 
inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork, even the 
most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and 
communities. I commend the entire team for their efforts on this 
worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local 
community.
I rise today to recognize the exceptional 
courage and service of Lieutenant Brandon Hall of Buchanan County, 
Virginia.
  On May 1st, Lieutenant Hall responded to an emergency in which a 
camper had filled with dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Inside the 
camper were two adults and a child, all unconscious. When faced with an 
invisible but deadly threat, Lieutenant Hall entered the camper, 
removed the victims, and quickly administered critical first aid.
  In a moment of crisis, Lieutenant Hall was among the first to arrive, 
and when faced with danger, he did not pause. Lieutenant Halls bravery 
and quick thinking saved these lives and stand as a testament to the 
selfless courage of the public servants in Virginias Ninth 
Congressional District.
  Today, we recognize Lieutenant Hall for his swift and courageous 
response. The strength and skill he demonstrated in a time of 
emergency, reflect the very best of Southwest Virginia. We thank him 
for his service and are deeply grateful for his dedication.
I rise today to recognize the Westfield Fire 
Department as they celebrate 150 years of service to our community. 
Since its founding as a volunteer fire department in 1875, the WFD has 
grown into a career department, providing essential fire protection 
services to the residents of Westfield and the surrounding area. Over 
the past 150 years, they have answered the call in times of need--often 
under dangerous and demanding conditions--a true testament to the 
courage, duty, and selflessness that embody the very best of New 
Jerseys first responders. I extend my deepest congratulations to the 
Westfield Fire Department on this milestone anniversary and look 
forward to their continued growth and commitment to public safety for 
many years to come.
