          CELEBRATING THE CITY OF MENASHA&#x27;S 150TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. GLENN GROTHMAN

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, the first European settlers arrived in 
present day Menasha in 1835. In 1848, Governor James Doty and Curtis 
Reed formed the Town of Menasha, naming it after the Winnebago word for 
``thorn&#x27;&#x27; or ``island&#x27;&#x27; and otherwise known in the Menominee language 
as ``little island&#x27;&#x27;. In 1849, the navigational channel of the Fox-
Wisconsin waterway was placed through the north channel in Menasha, 
leading to the construction of the Manitowoc and Mississippi Railroad 
in 1854. The creation of this railroad led to major water and rail 
transportation routes passing directly through the city. Menasha was 
officially incorporated as a city in 1874, and was considered to be a 
transportation hub.
  One of the earliest successes of the newly established city was the 
Menasha Wooden Ware Company which produced wooden tubs and barrels, and 
eventually made its way to become the world&#x27;s largest wooden ware 
products manufacturer. Evolving into the corrugated packaging business, 
the company changed its name to Menasha Corporation.
  By the early 1900&#x27;s, Menasha earned the moniker ``Industrial City,&#x27;&#x27; 
hosting renowned companies such as Menasha Corporation, the George A. 
Whiting Paper Company Mill, the John Strange Paper Mill, Island Paper 
Company, the Gilbert Paper Company, and the George Banta Publishing 
Company. These enterprises reflected a community characterized by 
ingenuity and the collaborative spirit of its residents, contributing 
to the city&#x27;s success through hard work and dedication.
  This year, as a Representative of the great state of Wisconsin, I am 
proud to join in commemorating the city of Menasha in the 
Sesquicentennial Anniversary of its founding. The celebration on the 
beautiful Menasha waterfront showcases various events honoring the 
city&#x27;s history, culture, character, and quality of life. The 
celebration aims to engage local residents along with visitors from 
other communities with associated observance activities in recognizing 
the city&#x27;s notable historical achievements along with their ongoing 
tenacity projecting a future vision of Menasha as Your Place on the 
Water.
  I would like to extend my gratitude and congratulations to the people 
of Menasha and wish the city 150 more years of prosperity and success.

                          ____________________

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Jasper L. Lewis of 
Greenville for his remarkable contributions to dentistry and his 
community, state, and Nation. Dr. Lewis graduated from Wake Forest 
University and received his doctorate in dental surgery from the 
University of North Carolina. From the beginning of his professional 
career, Dr. Lewis was committed to using his talents and expertise for 
the betterment of others. After receiving his degrees, Dr. Lewis 
decided to join the Air Force as a dental officer.
  Dr. Lewis returned home to Greenville and founded his own practice, 
Eastern Orthodontics &amp; Pediatrics. He has earned the reputation of an 
esteemed leader in his field, serving as President of the American 
Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and Vice President of the North Carolina 
Dental Society. He is also credited as a significant contributor to the 
founding of the Eastern Carolina University School of Dental Medicine 
and has a professorship named in his honor.
  Dr. Lewis has a big heart for the children of Eastern North Carolina 
affected by oral healthcare disparities. He helped bring the American 
Dental Association&#x27;s ``Give Kids a Smile&#x27;&#x27;, a nationwide program 
providing free dental services to uninsured children, to Eastern North 
Carolina. As all can see, Dr. Lewis&#x27;s charity and influence touched 
many lives. Dr. Lewis was recently recognized by the Greenville-Pitt 
County Chamber of Commerce and became one of only ten recipients to 
receive the Legends Award.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in extending this chamber&#x27;s recognition 
of this remarkable servant leader.

  HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WASHINGTON ASSOCIATION OF NEW 
                                 JERSEY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 150th anniversary 
of the Washington Association of New Jersey based in New Jersey&#x27;s 
Eleventh Congressional District, and their longstanding commitment to 
preserving our nation&#x27;s early history.
  During the harshest winter of the Revolutionary War from 1779 to 
1780, Jacob Ford Jr.&#x27;s mansion in Morristown, New Jersey served as the 
military headquarters for George Washington as the Continental Army 
encamped nearby. Recognizing the importance of this site, the 
Washington Association of New Jersey was founded on March 30, 1874 with 
the goal of preserving and maintaining the Ford Mansion.
  In 1933, the Washington Association was instrumental in advocating 
for the establishment of our country&#x27;s first National Historical Park, 
as they shared the important history of the Ford Mansion, Jockey 
Hollow, and Fort Nonsense with the 65th Congress. I am grateful to the 
Washington Association for its dedication to preserving this important 
history for both the State of New Jersey and the United States.
  Today, visitors can appreciate the beauty and historical importance 
of Washington&#x27;s Headquarters and the Morristown Historical Park thanks 
to the efforts and foresight of the Washington Association of New 
Jersey. New Jersey is the Crossroads of the American Revolution and I 
especially look forward to welcoming people from all over America and 
the world to these sites in 2026 as we celebrate the 250th anniversary 
of our nation.
  For the past 150 years, the Washington Association has shared New 
Jersey&#x27;s Revolutionary War history with all of us and that is why I am 
honored to recognize them on this important anniversary.

                          HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN

                              of arkansas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to extend 
my deepest condolences on the passing of Cliff Goodin, a pillar of the 
community whose legacy will forever resonate throughout Russellville 
and the Fourth Congressional District of Arkansas.
  Cliff&#x27;s journey, rooted in the humble beginnings of Bald Knob, 
Arkansas, was marked by unwavering dedication and an unyielding 
commitment to service others. From his early days as a beloved son of 
Duval Grant Goodin and Minnie Collison Goodin, to his steadfast 
companionship with his college sweetheart Sara Lou Snow, Cliff 
exemplified the virtues of love, loyalty, and resilience. Their 
enduring bond, spanning 59 years, stands as a testament to the enduring 
power of partnership and family.
  As a visionary entrepreneur and respected leader, Cliff left an 
indelible mark on the community through his pioneering efforts in the 
real estate industry. From his tenure at Vernon Howard Realty to the 
founding of Cliff Goodin &amp; Associates, Realtors, Cliff&#x27;s innovative 
spirit and tireless work ethic propelled the development of countless 
commercial and residential projects, shaping the landscape of the River 
Valley for generations to come.
  Beyond his professional achievements, Cliffs legacy is defined by his 
selfless service to others. As a dedicated member of the real estate 
community, he generously shared his time and expertise, serving in 
various capacities including President of the Arkansas REALTORS 
Association and as an ARPAC Trustee. His advocacy and leadership were 
instrumental in advancing the interests of his colleagues and 
advocating for policies that promoted economic growth and prosperity.
  Cliffs impact extended far beyond the boardroom, as he actively 
engaged in civic leadership and community service. Whether through his 
involvement with organizations such as the Russellville Jaycees, Lions 
Club, or Chamber of Commerce, Cliff demonstrated an unwavering 
commitment to improving the lives of those around him. His passion for 
civic engagement and grassroots activism inspired others to follow in 
his footsteps, leaving an enduring legacy of service and leadership.
  As we reflect on Cliff&#x27;s remarkable life, let us draw inspiration 
from his boundless generosity, unwavering integrity, and steadfast 
devotion to his family and community. Though he may no longer walk 
among us, his spirit will continue to guide and inspire us in the days 
ahead.
  May Sara Lou, Gaye, Julie, and the entire Goodin family, find comfort 
in the cherished memories they shared with Cliff and solace in the 
knowledge that his legacy will endure as a beacon of hope and 
inspiration for generations to come. Let us honor Cliff&#x27;s memory by 
rededicating ourselves to the principles of service, compassion, and 
unity that he held dear. May his legacy continue to shine brightly, 
illuminating the path forward for the community and beyond.

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Magnolia Park&#x27;s own Gilda Ramirez.
  Gilda was born on February 12, 1963, in the shadow of Port Houston, a 
place that would come to define her life, and where some of her fondest 
memories were born, like hunting for Easter eggs in Mason Park.
  She knew at a young age that the door of opportunity to the halls of 
power had been cracked open for her generation, but it was up to her to 
open that door all the way and hold it open for the community.
  Gilda, ever-curious, took what she learned at Stephen F. Austin High 
School and Houston International University and embarked on a history-
making career as an executive at Houston&#x27;s Metropolitan Transit 
Authority and the Port of Houston, a place she loved dearly. She was 
amazed at all the different things that came through the Port and all 
the jobs and families it helped.
  She said she could never live far away from Magnolia Park. She kept 
coming back. She found joy in connecting people, fostering friendships, 
and serving the community that had given her so much.
  Through it all, Gilda never forgot those who would follow. She stayed 
committed to mentoring future professionals and supporting and 
empowering small, minority and women-owned businesses, and keeping that 
door open.
  Mr. Speaker, Gilda swung the door wide open, and she held it there 
through her final days. Because of her work, Latina women have a seat 
at the table, our future leaders have a seat at the table, our 
community has a seat at the table.
  Gilda won countless honors, from ``Hispanic Executive of the Year&#x27;&#x27; 
by the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to ``The One Woman Soaring 
Heights Award&#x27;&#x27; by the Texas Business Alliance, but it is especially 
sweet to honor the life of my friend in the Congress of the United 
States.
  Our prayers are with her husband, Richard Arevalo, her sister, 
Rebecca Pena, and her lovely and sharp girls, Coco and Lola.
  May God bless Gilda. I thank her for everything she did for us while 
she was with us here. May she please keep watch over us as we continue 
the fight for greater inclusion and shared properity for all.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and 
legacy of Gilda Ramirez.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Mr. IVEY. Mr. Speaker, as we recognize National Entrepreneurship Week 
and Black History Month, I rise today to highlight the accomplishments 
and challenges of America&#x27;s Black-owned small businesses.
  Black business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in 30 years 
with the share of Black households owning a business doubling between 
2019 and 2022. However, Black-owned small businesses still face 
distinct challenges, particularly as it relates to accessing capital, 
securing contracts, and navigating systemic biases within financial 
institutions and markets. Limited access to funding restricts the 
ability to scale and compete on an equal footing with their 
counterparts, hindering their potential for long-term success and 
growth.
  Due to limited credit access, higher shares of Black employer 
businesses are forced to turn to alternative forms of financing. 
According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, 49 percent of 
firms who pursue financing at an online lender do so because they were 
denied by other financial institutions.
  One of my constituents who has faced these types of challenges is 
Tiffany Kelly, the owner and founder of House of Ketubah Bridal in 
Mount Rainier, Maryland. Tiffany told me that her business has been 
overlooked and excluded from financing opportunities. But she hasn&#x27;t 
abandoned hope. Tiffany and her team continue to explore alternative 
avenues and innovative solutions to ensure that they can continue to 
serve their customers and the community.
  I urge my colleagues to work together to solve the access to capital 
challenges faced by small businesses and to consider the unique needs 
of minority-owned businesses during Black History Month.

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dudley 
Davenport and on the dedication of the gymnasium at Sharon High School 
in his honor.
  Born on December 14, 1937, Dudley Davenport was raised in Westport, 
Massachusetts, where he found a passion for sports, specifically 
basketball, at a young age. During Dudley&#x27;s time at Westport High 
School, he was a four-year starter on the basketball team and set an 
all-time scoring record with 1,529 points throughout his high school 
career. This record held for 50 years and earned Dudley a place in the 
Westport High School Athletic Hall of Fame. It was also in Westport 
where Dudley first met the love of his life, Shirley. They

[[Page E160]]

began dating Dudley&#x27;s sophomore year and were married in 1957. 
Together, Dudley and Shirley raised four children--David, Diane, Tracy, 
and Jay.
  Dudley went on to receive an athletic scholarship to play basketball 
at the University of Rhode Island and served as team captain. After 
graduating in 1960, Dudley taught at Roosevelt Junior High School in 
New Bedford for one year, before accepting a position to teach at 
Sharon High School. For 35 years, Dudley taught science at Sharon High 
School and quickly established himself as a pillar of the local 
community. In 1961, during his first year of teaching in Sharon, Dudley 
also began coaching the boys&#x27; varsity basketball team and continued to 
do so until 1983. Throughout his two decades as a coach, the team won 
five Hockomock League Championships and a total of 328 games. The team 
also qualified for the state tournament 18 times and played in 10 semi-
finals and four state finals. With a coaching record of 328-114, Dudley 
was inducted into the Sharon High School Athletic Hall of Fame as well 
as the Massachusetts Basketball Coaches&#x27; Hall of Fame and was a 
recipient of the MIAA Sherman A. Kinney Award for outstanding 
contributions to Massachusetts high school basketball. In addition to 
his work as a teacher and a coach, Dudley also took on the role of 
athletic director at Sharon High School in 1969 and held this position 
for nearly three decades. In 2010, to celebrate Dudley&#x27;s impact on the 
Hockomock League and athletics across the region, the league named a 
division after him--the Davenport Division.
  Dudley&#x27;s contributions to the Sharon community were not limited only 
to the classroom or basketball court. For over 40 years, Dudley served 
as a board member on the Sharon Credit Union as well as the Chairman 
for nearly two decades. Under his leadership, the credit union grew and 
transformed into the important resource that it is today. As an 
educator for over 35 years, Dudley understood the importance of access 
to education and played a critical role in establishing the Sharon 
Credit Union Scholarship Program, which awards scholarships to 
graduating seniors who excelled in academics, extracurriculars, and 
community service.
  Sadly, we lost Dudley too soon on May 15, 2019, at the age of 81. 
Dudley leaves behind a remarkable legacy as a loving father and devoted 
educator, coach, and mentor to students and colleagues alike. Although 
Dudley had a significant record as both a coach and player, what people 
remember most is the positive impact that Dudley had on those around 
him. On February 16, 2024, the Sharon community will gather together to 
dedicate the gymnasium at Sharon High School in memory of Dudley 
Davenport.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Dudley Davenport, my friend who 
positively impacted the lives of so many who were privileged to know 
him, and I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating his lifelong 
commitment to mentoring and supporting those in his community.

                        HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to 
congratulate The Stone Pony on its 50th anniversary as its staff, 
patrons, and the community gather to celebrate ``Stone Pony Day&#x27;&#x27; as 
proclaimed by the City of Asbury Park. The Stone Pony is a landmark 
music venue in Asbury Park, New Jersey and this milestone and its 
historical significance are truly deserving of this body&#x27;s recognition.
  Opened on February 8, 1974 by John P. ``Jack&#x27;&#x27; Roig and Robert 
``Butch&#x27;&#x27; Pielka, The Stone Pony has become synonymous with Asbury 
Park. Its storied past has seen triumphs and tribulations, but 
throughout its 50 years, The Stone Pony&#x27;s connection to rock and roll 
history has cemented its status and success as preeminent music venue. 
Its stage has been graced by a venerable list of talent, including New 
Jersey native Bruce Springsteen, Ronnie Spector, the Ramones, Joan 
Jett, Peter Frampton, Green Day, Kenny Chesney, and The Black Crowes. 
Many artists launched their careers at the Pony, including New Jersey 
rock band The Smithereens, who credit The Stone Pony for their start. 
One of the venue&#x27;s first house bands, Southside Johnny and the Asbury 
Jukes, helped buoy the venue&#x27;s following and still play there today.
  The venue is a mainstay of Asbury Park, and its history is woven into 
that of the city. The Stone Pony&#x27;s commitment to promoting local and 
national musical acts has contributed to the thriving cultural 
landscape of the city. In addition, it has supported local charities 
and philanthropic efforts throughout its history, hosting benefit 
concerts for hunger initiatives, local youth programs, Parkinson&#x27;s 
disease research, and music education, among others.
  Mr. Speaker, once again, it is with pride that I recognize the 
remarkable history and contributions of The Stone Pony and congratulate 
it on its 50th anniversary. The Stone Pony continues to bring local 
talent and renowned musical acts to residents and visitors, drawing 
crowds from across New Jersey and beyond. Its impact on the community 
and the music scene is undeniable, and its legacy has echoed throughout 
New Jersey and the country for five decades.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DAVID ROUZER

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, February 16, 2024

  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced a bipartisan 
resolution to highlight the plight of Dr. Gubad Ibadoghlu, a respected 
academic and economist who taught and conducted research at several top 
universities in America, including Duke University and UNC Chapel Hill 
in my home state of North Carolina.
  While on a trip to Azerbaijan to visit his sick mother back in July 
of 2023, he and his wife were brutally assaulted by Azerbaijani 
authorities, and he was arrested on politically motivated, baseless 
charges. To this day, he continues to be detained and cruelly denied 
access to regular legal counsel and critical medications. This abuse is 
wrong and life-threatening.
  What Dr. Ibadoghlu is currently experiencing is a sobering reminder 
of what can and does happen in nations that have no regard for human 
rights with a history of jailing individuals on baseless charges. With 
this resolution, we join the State Department and many members of 
international civil society in calling for his unconditional release.

                          ____________________
