I rise today to celebrate the 
remarkable contributions of Asia Food Market, a cornerstone of the 
Western New York community and one of the largest retailers of Asian 
products in our region. With a diverse selection of over ten thousand 
goods sourced from across Asia--including Thailand, the Philippines, 
India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and many more--Asia Food Market 
brings the flavors, traditions, and richness of Asian cultures right to 
the heart of the Buffalo Niagara Region.
  Their mission goes far beyond providing authentic food. Asia Food 
Market is committed to enriching the cultural fabric of our community, 
fostering understanding, appreciation, and shared experiences among 
people of all backgrounds. It stands as a vital bridge between

  With the exciting opening of the Asia Center Mall, the organization 
is poised to take that mission even further. This new space combines 
retail, dining, entertainment, and cultural programming, creating a 
dynamic hub for community engagement and cross-cultural connection. The 
Asia Center Mall represents a bold vision: one where multiculturalism 
is not only celebrated but woven into the daily life and economic 
vitality of our region.
, as we acknowledge this milestone, let us recognize the 
essential role that Asia Food Market plays--not just as a business, but 
as a beacon of cultural exchange, economic growth, and community 
spirit. Please join me in applauding the achievements and continued 
success of both Asia Food Market and the Asia Center Mall, as they 
remain an enduring source of pride and connection for generations to 
come.

I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate Danielle Roberts, a cause-driven leader whose unwavering 
passion and commitment to community have made a profound impact 
throughout Western New York.
  In her role as Vice President of Community Impact, Ms. Roberts 
oversees YMCA Buffalo Niagaras association-wide fundraising and 
outreach initiatives and leads major community programs, including the 
iconic YMCA Turkey Trot--the oldest consecutively run footrace in the 
world. She also played a key leadership role in the YMCAs Capital 
Campaign to construct a new 65,000-square-foot state-of-the-art 
facility that will expand access to health and wellness resources for 
everyone in Western New York to enjoy.
  A staunch advocate for equity, Ms. Roberts has worked to close racial 
disparities in swim instruction and water safety, particularly among 
African-American teens, who face significantly higher risks of drowning 
due to a lack of access. Under her guidance, the William-Emslie YMCA 
and its partners are building pathways for competitive swimming and 
promoting safety education in historically underserved communities.

beacon of what it means to be a good neighbor in the ``City of Good 
Neighbors and a leader who embodies the very best of what we can 
achieve for the greater good, and we are all the better for it.
I rise today to celebrate an 
extraordinary young leader from Western New York--Miss Destini Houston. 
At just 16 years old, Miss Houston is showing us all that leadership, 
kindness, and advocacy can go hand in hand.
  Miss Houston was recently crowned Miss Western New Yorks Teen, a 
title she has embraced not for the spotlight but to shine a light on 
causes close to her heart. She is now receiving national recognition 
for her inspiring efforts, and she will be honored as New Yorks 
recipient of the Kindest Kid in America award.
  To celebrate her achievement, the award organization has created a 
childrens book inspired by Miss Houstons journey. She will read it to 
students throughout Western New York in hopes of inspiring a new 
generation to lead with compassion and purpose. Miss Houston has said, 
``Being kind isnt just about being nice to people--its about taking 
action to help others. She lives by those words. From volunteering 
and mentoring to working with the Buffalo Urban League to organize an 
informational event for prospective foster and adoptive families, she 
is a true changemaker in her community.
  In addition to her advocacy, Miss Houston is also a competitive 
dancer training in multiple styles and performing at high-level 
competitions. Her dedication to dance has helped build the discipline 
and confidence that now serve her well as she prepares to compete in 
the Miss New York pageant.
, please join me in celebrating Destini Houston--not only 
as Miss Western New Yorks Teen or the Kindest Kid in America but as a 
role model, a community leader, and a beacon of hope for the future. 
Her impact reaches far beyond titles and trophies. Miss Houston reminds 
us all that even the smallest acts of kindness can lead to something 
truly extraordinary. Destinis leadership has left an indelible mark on 
our city, and we are all the better for it.
I rise today to celebrate the 92nd birthday 
of a remarkable individual, Russell J. Salvatore, a beloved member of 
our community and Army veteran

occasion of his 92nd birthday, please join me in wishing Russell J. 
Salvatore the happiest of birthdays, with many more to come.
I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
, after an extraordinary career as 
an award-winning writer and editor. Since 1976 Mr. Frisbie has, as he 
likes to say ``held almost every job at the Chicago Sun-Times besides 
editor.
  His commitment to bringing Chicago the news has earned many accolades 
over the years, including the Jacob Scher Award for Excellence in 
Investigative Reporting for his series covering insurance fraud at 
Illinois largest driving school. He was a finalist for the Peter 
Lisagor Award twice for his work on judicial conflicts of interest and 
the open sale of illegal drugs in Cook County Forest Preserves. He was

Chicago Sun-Times Final Markets and the Chicago Sun-Times PM edition.
  He also co-authored ``Victims of Justice and contributed, and 
edited ``20th Century Chicago: 100 Years,100 Voices, a chronological 
history of Chicago.
, please join me and all of our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives in recognizing Mr. Frisbie for his immense contribution 
of keeping Chicagoans informed.
I rise today to recognize and 
honor a foundational institution in Western New Yorks spiritual and 
civil life, the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church of Buffalo, 
NY and its dedicated pastor, Reverend Paul J. Thomas.
  Founded in 1831, Bethel AME Church stands as the oldest African-
American congregation in Western New York. For nearly two centuries, 
Bethel has been a cornerstone of strength, faith, and leadership in 
Buffalo, nurturing generations, advancing social justice, and offering 
an unwavering commitment to the community it serves. It is a place 
where history and hope walk hand in hand, where the spirit of unity and 
progress has never wavered.
  Under the leadership of Reverend Paul J, Thomas, Bethel AME continues 
to thrive. Reverend Thomas brings a wealth of knowledge, compassion, 
and a vision to his ministry. A graduate of Lincoln University of 
Pennsylvania and Turner Theological Seminary, he combines his training 
with a heart for education and outreach, holding a masters degree in 
Special Education as well. His leadership has deepened the churchs 
mission, strengthened its outreach, and reaffirmed its role as a 
spiritual and cultural anchor in Buffalo.
  As we welcome visitors from across New York State and the greater 
First Episcopal District, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, 
New England, and Bermuda, to the 29th Session of the Western New York 
Conference, hosted by Bethel AME, we are reminded of the power of faith 
to bring people together and to move communities forward.
  Reverend Thomas and the entire Bethel AME family represent the very 
best of the City of Good Neighbors. Their work uplifts lives, unites 
neighborhoods, and strengthens the bonds that hold our community 
together.
I rise today to honor someone whos spent 
his life making sure the rest of us stay informed--not by standing in 
front of a camera, but by quietly, tirelessly, and professionally 
working behind it for over four decades.
  Even though you dont see his face on TV, Mike Cole is a cornerstone 
of Boston journalism and one of the most trusted names in the business. 
He got his start at WHDH before moving to FOX 25--eventually landing at 
WCVB in 2003. But the values hes carried from newsroom to newsroom 
havent changed: Fairness, transparency, accountability, and truth.
  For the past 28 years, Mike has been a force of nature at WCVB, 
producing NewsCenter 5 and the Sunday morning political program On the 
Record. Its the most-watched political talk show in New England--and 
for good reason. Its thoughtful, fair, and tough. And Mike is one of 
the main reasons why: Chasing down stories, booking guests, double-
checking facts, and putting together a show that keeps viewers informed 
and engaged. He has an uncanny ability to know which questions will 
break news and get people talking. Ive had the privilege of going On 
the Record many times over the years, and I can tell you that Mike is 
the real deal. He cares deeply about getting clear, concise, accurate 
information on the air. And that kind of public service is beyond 
invaluable.
, I also think its important to recognize that this kind 
of journalism is under attack.
  Here in the United States, weve seen political leaders demonize 
reporters just for doing their jobs. Weve heard phrases like ``fake 
news used to discredit hard truths. Weve seen threats against 
journalists trying to tell the public whats going on. And around the 
world, autocrats and strongmen are increasingly throwing reporters in 
jail, shutting down news outlets, and targeting those they dont like 
with censorship and violence
  In moments like this, we need to uplift people who are fighting for 
the truth. Because at the end of the day, freedom of the press is about 
more than just the ability of a journalist to write or say whatever 
they want. Its about our ability, as a society, to make decisions 
based on the facts--put in context, and delivered fairly and 
impartially. Mr. Speaker, it is

not an exaggeration to say that our democracy depends on people like 
Mike Cole--working behind the scenes to get the story right, to ask 
hard questions, and to speak truth to power.
  So, on behalf of the people of the Second Congressional District of 
Massachusetts and the United States Congress--I thank Mike for his 
dedication, his professionalism, his integrity, and his decades of 
service to the people of New England. Were all better off because of 
his work to shine the light of truth on the stories that matter--and to 
hold accountable those we entrust to lead our communities, our 
commonwealth, and our country.
I rise today, alongside my colleague Rep. 
Dan Newhouse, to honor the life and legacy of Washingtons former 
Secretary of Health, Mary Selecky. For over four decades, Mary 
dedicated her life and career to public health throughout Washington. 
She began her career as the administrator for the Northeast Tri County 
Health District. In 1999, she was appointed as the Secretary of Health 
by Governor Gary Locke and continued in that role under Governors Chris 
Gregoire and Jay Inslee until her retirement in 2013.
  During her tenure, Mary was instrumental in reducing smoking rates 
and increasing childhood vaccination coverage across the state. She was 
known for her commitment to preventive care and for strengthening the 
collaboration between state and local health agencies.
  Beyond her professional accomplishments, Mary was deeply connected to 
her community in Colville, Washington, where she resided for over 50 
years. Her dedication to both her local community and the broader 
public health landscape left a lasting impact on the state. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mary Seleckys life 
and contributions to public health.
I rise today to honor the life 
and service of Retired Brigadier General Eden Murrie. Throughout a 
distinguished twenty-nine-year career in the United States Air Force, 
Eden was awarded the Legion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Service 
Medal, and the Aerial Achievement Medal, among many others. She also 
earned the title of ``master navigator after logging over 2,400 
flying hours as well as serving as a flight instructor for three 
different aircraft. After achieving the rank of General Officer in 
2009, Eden served as special assistant to the Vice Chief of Staff at 
the United States Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C., before 
transitioning to the Director of Legislative Affairs on the National 
Security Staff for the White House. From 2011 to 2013, she served as 
the Director of Air Force Services and Deputy Chief of Staff for 
Manpower, Personnel, and Services at the U.S. Air Force Headquarters. 
Soon after retiring from military service. Eden became the Chief 
Operations Officer of Operation Stand Down Tennessee (OSDTN) in 2017 
and became its Chief Executive Officer in 2020. OSDTN is the only 
comprehensive veteran-serving agency in Middle Tennessee, connecting 
veterans with careers, community, and crisis services.
  Under her leadership, OSDTN has served thousands of veterans by 
delivering food boxes, providing financial assistance, helping veterans 
find housing, and assisting veterans in their transition from military 
to civilian life. In her final full year as CEO, Operation Stand Down 
Tennessee served 7,991 veterans while receiving over 16,000 visits to 
OSDTN centers. Her dedication to serving our nation and its veterans 
has left an indelible mark on our Armed Forces and Middle Tennessee.
  Eden is also a prominent leader in my community. She has served on 
the boards for The Women in Military Service for America Memorial 
Foundation, Tennessee State Veterans Homes, Centerstone Military 
Services, and the Davidson County Veterans Court Foundation, as well as 
an adviser for the Nashville YWCA Dress for Success program.
  As Eden steps down from her role as CEO of Operation Stand Down 
Tennessee. I want to wish her the best and thank her for her decades of 
public and private service. I know she will tackle her next chapter 
with the same passion and tenacity as her other outstanding 
achievements.
OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT TRUMPS AND ELON MUSKS THEFT OF SOCIAL 
                              of illinois
as a policymaker and citizen, I 
unconditionally and absolutely reject President Trumps and Elon Musks 
work to steal Americans Social Security benefits, a scheme that hurts 
middle-class and working-class families and seniors to pay for tax 
handouts to billionaires. When Americans already face increased prices 
and economic hardship from the Presidents chaotic policies, Mr. Trump 
threatens Social Security--the leading assistance program that 73 
million Americans depend on for monthly assistance. This group includes 
the more than 7 million seniors aged 65 or older for whom 90 percent of 
their income is their earned Social Security benefits. Without Social 
Security, 52.2 percent of older women would live in poverty. About 45 
percent of Black seniors, 52 percent of Latino seniors, and 41 percent 
of Asian-American seniors rely mostly or only on Social Security for 
income. This effort to gut Social Security is an appalling illustration 
of the highest level of greed, where billionaires rob from hard-working 
Americans to augment their wealth.
  By slashing staff, closing 6 out of 10 regional offices, cutting 
customer service operations, restricting phone service assistance, and 
spreading falsehoods about the Social Security Administration (SSA), 
Trump and Musk jeopardize Americans earned benefits and security. Let 
me be clear--cuts to the Social Security Administration that prevent 
beneficiaries from accessing their benefits are absolutely, 
unequivocally backdoor benefit cuts. Seniors and people with 
disabilities cannot get help by phone due to reduced phone service. 
They cant get help by the website that frequently crashes and presents 
access barriers to the elderly. Nor can they get help in person given 
the increased distance to offices and longer wait times due to dramatic 
staff cuts and office closures.
  At the time when the greatest number of baby boomers are retiring and 
need the most help and when SSA already is at its lowest staffing level 
in decades, it is unconscionable that the Republicans seek to gut 
Social Security and throw seniors, orphans, and those with disabilities 
into poverty. All baby boomers will be 67 by 2031. So we are in the 
peak period of retirement. I introduced the Keeping Our Field Offices 
Open Act as an essential step to protecting Social Security benefits 
for the 1 in 5 Americans who need these community offices. Field 
offices serve as a lifeline for seniors and people with disabilities, 
giving the in-person assistance to ensure they receive their correct 
benefits. In my Congressional District alone, 68,550 retired workers, 
12,772 disabled workers, and 5,239 widowers or parents receive critical 
Social Security benefits. An additional 25,000 receive Supplemental 
Security Income to pay their bills and survive. These constituents rely 
on field offices when they need help. Field offices are not extra or 
fluff; they are crucial.
  I also must refuse the default Republican Social Security ``reform 
of raising the retirement age to 70 given that it would 
disproportionately harm Black men and communities of color who have 
lower life expectances. Systematic inequalities in socioeconomic 
status, education, food security, and access to healthcare play an 
intricate role in life expectancy. The life expectancy for Black men is 
age 72.8, in contrast to 77.5 for White men. All Americans should 
equitably reap the earned benefits of their tireless labor.
  With fewer than 100 days in office, President Trump has already 
caused tremendous harm to Social Security, jeopardizing the well-being 
of tens of millions of seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities. 
This assault on Social Security is an assault on our nations most 
vulnerable and least secure. Across the nation, this damage is in 
addition to his erratic

and senseless tariffs and the dramatic reductions or eliminations of 
essential supports for housing, healthcare, food, and education and so 
much more. These policies threaten the livelihoods of individuals and 
our nations economy--all so the obscenely wealthy grow more secure 
while condemning the majority to a precarious existence, defenseless 
against lifes unpredictability and wholly susceptible to exploitation 
and despair. I will fight with every ounce of my being to oppose 
President Trumps and Elon Musks theft of Social Security and the 
Republican effort to cripple Americans for their greed.
I rise to recognize an important birthday 
being celebrated in Boise, Idaho. Mrs. Margaret Elizabeth Mortensen 
turns 108 years of age on April 21, 2025.
  Margaret was born in Deer Lodge, Montana on April 21, 1917. Her 
parents were John Matthew Briggeman and Gerena Wolfe Briggeman. Their 
family moved with the Wolfe family to Lemhi, Idaho about 1920.
  Margaret attended grade school in a one-room schoolhouse in Lemhi. 
She then attended Idaho State College in Pocatello, Idaho, first as a 
business major, then as a pharmacy major. Margaret graduated in 1938 as 
a pharmacist. She worked in Homedale, Idaho where she met Art 
Mortensen. She married Art Mortensen on June 25, 1941, in Nampa, Idaho. 
While still working as a pharmacist and wanting to help Art with his 
aircraft flying business, Margaret began taking courses to become 
certified as an aviation ground school instructor during WWII. Margaret 
taught aviation ground school to student pilots in Idaho and Oregon in 
1942 and 1943, one of very few women in the Northwest to do so.
  Margaret and Art had three children: Robert, Ann, and Perry. After 
the war, they owned and operated a drug store in Nampa, Idaho. Since 
the drug store was open six days a week, there was no vacation time. 
After three years they sold the drug store, and took a vacation for six 
months in Corpus Christi, Texas. The family lived in a 16 ft travel 
trailer on the beach. Margaret and Art returned to Idaho and bought a 
drug store in Parma. They operated that store for four years before 
selling it, and took the family to Fairbanks, Alaska in the 16 ft 
travel trailer for the summer of 1959. Next, they moved to San Jacinto, 
California and stayed for two years. Upon moving back to Idaho, they 
bought and operated a drug store in Meridian, in 1961. They sold that 
drug store and moved back to Parma. In 1968 Margaret and Art started 
the A-BAR-M Mobile Home Park which provided affordable housing for 
families living and working in the area. While still managing the 
Mobile Home Park, they moved to the San Juan Islands in the state of 
Washington, where Margaret worked as the pharmacist in Friday Harbor.
  After retirement, Margaret and Art bought a small motorhome and 
traveled the United States from Washington to Florida. Art Mortensen 
passed away in 1987, in Bellingham, Washington. Margaret now lives with 
her son Robert and his wife Connie, in Boise. Idaho. She is celebrating 
her 108th birthday on April 21, 2025, with family and friends.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mrs. Margaret 
Elizabeth Mortensen as she, her family, and friends, celebrate her 
108th birthday.
I rise with my colleague Congressman Ro 
Khanna to recognize Fremont Firefighter Anthony Ganzler, on the 
occasion of his passing on March 17, 2025, at the age of 42.
  Anthony joined the Fremont Fire Department in 2019, serving on the 
Departments Special Operations Task Force. Prior to joining the 
Fremont Fire Department, Anthony worked at the El Dorado County Fire 
Protection District as a Firefighter/Emergency Medical Technician from 
2015 to 2019.
  Predating his time as a firefighter, Anthony served in the United 
States Armys 173rd Airborne Division for more than eight years. 
Throughout his service he was stationed in Hawaii, Alaska, and a number 
of other locations throughout the country.
  Anthony was one of many firefighters in the department who raised 
awareness about mens health issues during the month of November each 
year. His enthusiastic support for the campaign titled ``Movember is 
apparent in his most recent fire department photo, which now 
memorializes his notorious sense of humor.
  Anthony was known as a lion of a man with a big heart and warm 
personality. He will always be remembered as a kind and selfless 
individual who dedicated his life to serving others.
  Our communities will miss his presence deeply. He had a deep devotion 
to public service and his passing is an immeasurable loss for everyone 
around him, including his colleagues at the Fremont Fire Department.
  We send our deepest condolences to Anthonys wife, Erin, and his two 
daughters, Savannah and Abigail, as well as his other surviving family, 
friends, and fellow firefighters who were lucky to have Anthony in 
their lives.
