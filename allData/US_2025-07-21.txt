                CELEBRATING A CHAMPION, CASSANDRA WILSON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARCY KAPTUR

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 21, 2025

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true champion from 
Northwest Ohio, Cassandra Wilson.
  Cassandra is not only the first woman in Lucas County to bring home 
gold medals four years in a row for Special Olympics Powerlifting, she 
is also a fearless advocate who has served as the first Self Advocate 
from her county on the State Developmental Disabilities Council.
  Since the age of five, Cassandra has been a voice for those too often 
left unheard. Her advocacy, determination, and unbreakable spirit have 
shattered barriers and inspired communities.
  Even when faced with coaches who doubted her, she stood strong.
  She proved--and continues to prove--that strength isn&#x27;t just about 
lifting weights; it&#x27;s about lifting others up with you.
  She reminds us all that true leadership begins with courage, and true 
change comes from those who never give up. She is not just breaking 
records, she&#x27;s breaking ground.
  Cassandra is a living example that hard work and confidence, not 
gender or circumstance, defines our potential.
  May her story continue to lift hearts, open minds, and pave the way 
for many more to follow.

                          ____________________

                         Monday, July 21, 2025

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
woman whose life of faith, service, and leadership has left a lasting 
impact on her community and the Church.
  Mother Regina Rose Edwards, who is celebrating 90 blessed years, is a 
native of River Rouge, Michigan. She has dedicated her life in service 
to her Church and community and has raised a proud family.
  Throughout our Nation&#x27;s history, we have always been inspired by 
those whose faith and unwavering commitment uplifts others. Mother 
Regina Rose Edwards goes beyond these criteria.
  For decades, Mother Edwards has embodied compassion, wisdom, and 
dedication in her role as matriarch within the Church of God in Christ 
and as a beloved member of the Michigan Southwest First Ecclesiastical 
Jurisdiction.
  Her ministry has brought comfort and community to countless families. 
Through prayer, mentorship, and love, she has been a guiding light to 
many.
  As she celebrates her 90th birthday, I wanted to take an opportunity 
to recognize her faith, service, and lifetime of commitment to her 
community.
  Mr. Speaker, the legacy of Mother Regina Rose Edwards is one of 
service over self. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and 
celebrating her remarkable achievements and contributions to our 
Nation, her community, and the Church.

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to the 
Fiscal Year 2026 Defense Appropriations Act, which provides $10 million 
to support testing of tethered unmanned aircraft system prototypes.
  Tethered drones, which are physically connected to a ground-based 
power source, offer critical protection against cyberattacks--an 
increasingly important safeguard given rising threats from adversaries 
like China and North Korea.
  My amendment 275, included in Bipartisan En Bloc No. 2, provides the 
Army with the necessary resources to procure and test tethered drones.
  Tethered drone testing could lead to further innovation and advance 
the Army&#x27;s mission capabilities.
  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

IIBA, Mariposa, Napa High School, Vintage High School, Valley Oak High

  Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and proper that we honor Cinthya Cisneros

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and mourn the passing 
of Mr. Donald R. Dwight of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Mr. Dwight was a 
Marine, newspaper executive, and dedicated public servant. Born in 
Massachusetts, he attended Deerfield Academy and Princeton before 
serving as an active-duty Marine, where he earned the rank of captain. 
A man dedicated to his country, Mr. Dwight held multiple public 
offices, including serving as the 64th Lieutenant Governor of 
Massachusetts. As Lieutenant Governor, he worked behind the scenes to 
serve his state and always stood up for what he felt was right.
  After leaving public office, Mr. Dwight led newspapers in Minneapolis 
and New England and was responsible for printing seven separate 
publications. He was dedicated to local, independent journalism and 
never hesitated to follow a difficult story.
  Outside of his public life, Mr. Dwight was a loving husband, father, 
and grandfather. To those who knew him, he was endlessly curious, and 
never afraid to try new things. He always knew how to ask the right 
questions and was driven by unflinching dedication to the common good. 
The mark he left on his community, state, and country will never be 
forgotten, and for that, we are forever grateful.

                         Monday, July 21, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Edgar 
Ontiveros, a leader and public servant who has been named California&#x27;s 
4th Congressional District 2025 American Dream Award Recipient for Lake 
County. This award recognizes the achievements of immigrants in our 
district who have made remarkable contributions to our communities in 
the areas of Arts and Culture, Professional Achievement, 
Entrepreneurship and Innovation, or Community Service.
  For many years, Mr. Ontiveros came to Hidden Valley to visit his 
uncle during the weekends. In 2003, he had the chance to visit 
Clearlake for the first time, sparking his love for the Lake County 
community. By 2004, he had the opportunity to purchase a house in 
Clearlake and has lived in the area ever since.
  In 2009, Mr. Ontiveros joined the staff of Lake County Behavioral 
Health Services (LCBHS) as a Cultural Specialist and Ethnic Services 
Peer Support Specialist. In 2014, LCBHS created the La Voz De la 
Esperanza community center, appointing Mr. Ontiveros as the center&#x27;s 
supervisor. The La Voz, or the Latino Wellness Center, located in 
Clearlake, works to connect the Latino Community to culturally relevant 
service and ensure that Spanish speakers are equipped with tools to 
navigate health and wellness services. With volunteer translators and 
various educational opportunities, they help to break the language 
barrier that often prevents people from seeking help and offer 
referrals for mental health services when requested.
  Mr. Ontiveros&#x27; leadership and work as the supervisor of La Voz 
integral in ensuring countless community members have access to mental 
health support, help to navigate the health care system, and a sense of 
community and support. As a Certified Medi-Cal Peer Support Specialist, 
he works to assess critical needs of Latino community members regarding 
mental health services and support clients, both individual and family.
  Mr. Ontiveros also works tirelessly to develop, implement, and 
maintain activities and programs related to the Latino Wellness Center. 
He recruits and trains volunteers and develops relationships with 
partner agencies and community entities. Additionally, Mr. Ontiveros 
connects Latino community members to services through the Behavioral 
Health Department, providing key mental health services for those who 
may not otherwise have access.
  Mr. Ontiveros&#x27; commitment to service extends well beyond his 
professional duties. Mr. Ontiveros has taken to the front lines of 
community support following the countless fires that devastated Lake 
County, communicating important information and ensuring that Lake 
County residents have equitable access to emergency services and 
necessities during major disasters. Mr. Ontiveros is an ordained 
minister and faith leader. He works as a preacher in Middletown for the 
South Lake County community.
  Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and proper that we honor La Voz director 
Edgar Ontiveros for his service, leadership, and dedication to the Lake 
County community.

  The Agriculture Program at St. Helena High School aims to shape young

stewardship, leadership, and community service in our students.
  The St. Helena Agriculture Program has touched the lives of over 
3,500+ students in the St. Helena community through positive 
experiences in relevant, rigorous, and relationship driven coursework 
and involvement in the National Future Farmers of America Organization. 
These opportunities have been made possible by the financial backing of 
the St. Helena Agriculture Booster Organization.

  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the outstanding 
contributions of Mr. Lee Vent, a lifelong administrator and educator, 
who was recently recognized as a Legacy Leader by the Arkansas 
Association of Educational Administrators. The organization is 
dedicated to supporting and enhancing educational leadership in 
Arkansas through various initiatives and legislative advocacy. This 
prestigious award recognizes individuals who have demonstrated 
exceptional leadership and made significant contributions to the field 
of education in Arkansas.
  Mr. Vent has shown unwavering dedication with an incredible 56-year 
career in education, including 43 continuous years as a Superintendent, 
making him the longest continuously serving Superintendent in Arkansas. 
He currently serves as the President of the Great Rivers ESC Board of 
Directors and Superintendent of the Clarendon-Holly Grove School 
District. Mr. Vent is a strong testament to the vision, compassion, and 
resilience demonstrated by thousands of Arkansas educators.
  Mr. Vent&#x27;s love for learning began in a three-room schoolhouse, which 
had no indoor plumbing. He has spent most of his educational career in 
schools along the Mississippi Delta, or what he calls ``the pure 
Delta.&#x27;&#x27; He has dedicated his life to selflessly serving the community, 
and ensuring students are prepared for a promising and successful 
future. Mr. Vent embodies the very best of American educators, 
fostering a knowledgeable, collaborative, curious, and innovative 
learning environment for all.
  Mr. Vent&#x27;s continued efforts are well-recognized through his strength 
in personal and organizational communication and constant improvement 
of administrative knowledge and skills. His deep commitment to 
transforming our community through educational resources brings great 
pride to our district.
  It is my honor to congratulate Lee Vent on his recognition as a 
Legacy Leader and for his decades of service. I thank him for 
preserving the legacy of learning. I wish him continued success, and 
may his actions continue to encourage others.
