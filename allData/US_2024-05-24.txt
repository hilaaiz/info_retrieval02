                CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF RON HEYMANN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. AARON BEAN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 24, 2024

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 90th 
Birthday of Mr. Ron Heymann, although he doesn&#x27;t look a day over 45, I 
think the secret must be the early morning workouts at the YMCA.
  Mr. Heymann&#x27;s life reads like the All-American story. Born on June 2, 
1934, to Florence and Russel Heymann, Ron grew up in New Jersey where 
he attended Phillipsburg-Easton High and Rutgers University. After 
graduating from Rutgers in 1956, Ron served his country in the Army 
Reserves in El Paso, Texas and at the White Sands Missile Range in New 
Mexico.
  On June 22, 1959, Ron married his sweetheart, Barbara. They will soon 
celebrate their 65th wedding anniversary. Ron and Barbara are blessed 
with two children, Carol and Ron Jr., and a daughter-in-law Raegan.
  After his service to our country, Mr. Heymann spent most of his 
career working for Bell Telephone. He left the telecommunications world 
for a stint in politics, working for Governor William Cahill of New 
Jersey, as the Director of Motor Vehicles, and as a consultant to 
President Richard Nixon&#x27;s administration. Ron often says he did such a 
good job eliminating bureaucracy at the New Jersey DMV, the Heymann 
cars never passed another vehicle inspection until the family moved to 
the free state of Florida upon Ron&#x27;s retirement in 1991, taking up full 
time residence on Amelia Island.
  Since that time, Ron has been very active in the Fernandina Beach 
community. He worked as a docent at the Amelia Island Museum of 
History, directed traffic at the Presbyterian Vacation Bible School, 
and is an avid supporter of local charities. Of course, he has also 
spent hours shuttling his three grandchildren Megan, Kate, and Jack 
around the Island. On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of 
Florida, I thank him for his support to the community, his leadership 
in the Republican Party, and his dedication to his family.
  Mr. Speaker, if you want Mr. Heymann&#x27;s secret to staying youthful, 
you too can join me in an early morning workout at the YMCA and wish 
Mr. Heymann a very special 90th birthday.

      FINANCIAL INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, May 22, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4763, the 
Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.
  While I am opposed to this bill, I am not opposed to the concept of 
crypto itself. But I have concerns about how crypto is currently 
regulated and believe that H.R. 4763 falls short of creating an 
effective regulatory framework. H.R. 4763 would also result in the 
massive deregulation of the securities market, not just for crypto but 
for traditional securities as well. This deregulation would remove 
protections provided by existing securities law to protect crypto 
investors and consumers and remove disclosure requirements that are 
designed to help investors make informed decisions. Additionally. H.R. 
4763 would preempt state laws, disarming state regulators in Minnesota 
who are often on the frontlines against fraud.
  H.R. 4763 lacks necessary protections for crypto consumers and 
investors. As of today, the crypto asset industry does not comply with 
existing securities laws and regulations, allowing consumers to be 
defrauded. In fact, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 
received more than 8,300 complaints related to crypto between 2018-
2022. Roughly forty percent of those complaints were reporting frauds 
and scams. This bill will only exacerbate this issue. We must reject 
H.R. 4763 and work to create a regulatory framework that will protect 
everyday investors and consumers.

[[Page E562]]

  Crypto is the currency of choice for our foreign adversaries, 
terrorist groups, drug and human traffickers, child sex abusers, and 
ransomware attackers. These bad actors chose to use crypto because they 
know the industry does comply with securities laws and regulations, 
allowing the groups to circumvent regulatory, supervisory, and 
enforcement regimes. Congress should be considering legislation that 
will make it harder for these bad actors to access currency, not 
allowing loopholes to persist. We must ensure to be sure that crypto is 
not used as the black market for bad actors.
  Crypto asset platforms, where customers buy and sell crypto assets, 
are known to use vertical product and service integration, creating 
conflicts of interests for the platforms. Some crypto asset platforms 
blend exchange, brokerage, market making, and clearing agency functions 
in their platform. This vertical integration of products and services 
has long been prohibited in traditional markets because it leads to 
risks for investors. We saw this loophole exploited in 2022 when FTX&#x27;s 
CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, used its affiliated trading firm, Alameda 
Research, as a market maker, allowing FTX to transfer billions of 
dollars in customer accounts to Alameda. Sam Bankman-Fried is now 
serving a 25-year prison sentence for defrauding consumers. H.R. 4763 
bakes in these existing conflicts of interest, allowing crypto asset 
platforms like FTX to continue to work against their customers&#x27; best 
interest for their own gains.
  Rather than putting forward a bill that would severely undermine the 
functioning of our capital markets, Congress should instead consider a 
comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto that will promote the 
responsible development of these digital assets while protecting 
American consumers and investors. I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 
4763.

               NEWSLETTER FROM CONGRESSMAN CHUCK EDWARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 24, 2024

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents to bring awareness to 
issues surrounding the border and fentanyl crises, antisemitism and 
Americans&#x27; financial privacy.

       Dear Friend,
       It&#x27;s been more than a year since the House passed H.R. 2. 
     the Secure the Border Act, the strongest border security bill 
     in history.
       H.R. 2 would reimplement President Trump&#x27;s effective border 
     policies and end this administration&#x27;s border crisis, which 
     continues to jeopardize our national security and 
     sovereignty.
       In fact, a record-breaking number of nationals from our 
     adversary, China, are illegally crossing our border. In 
     April, the Customs and Border Patrol found that in this 
     fiscal year alone, they have encountered 27,583 Chinese 
     nationals, a nearly 8,000 percent increase from fiscal year 
     2021.
       With the rising threat of the Chinese Communist Party 
     (CCP), border security is paramount to national security and 
     I will not relent in the fight to secure America&#x27;s borders.
       I recently spoke on the House floor about how the fentanyl 
     pouring in through our borders has taken lives in our own 
     communities in the mountains and urged that this 
     administration put the American people first and close our 
     southern border once and for all.


                    The U.S. must stand with Israel

       As our ally, Israel, is defending itself from terrorist 
     organizations, it is critical that we continue to stand with 
     and support Israel.
       The president recently announced he would stop military aid 
     to Israel at a time when this aid is needed to target Hamas 
     terrorists and avoid more civilian casualties in what

[[Page E563]]

     looks like an attempt to appease the growing pro-Hamas 
     sentiment among the left.
       In light of this administration&#x27;s misguided decision to 
     halt military aid to Israel, a bipartisan group of colleagues 
     and I demanded that the president provide answers on his 
     decision to withhold shipments to Israel.
       Furthermore, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued 
     baseless arrest warrants for Israeli officials, equating them 
     to the terrorists who committed the horrific attacks of Oct. 
     7. The ICC&#x27;s decision is great news to terrorists around the 
     globe and is a slap in the face to the only free-standing 
     democracy in the Middle East.
       If I have my way, the United States will never abandon 
     Israel, especially not while it is fighting for the right to 
     exist and the rights of Jewish people everywhere, and no 
     country should recognize any legitimacy of a pro-terrorist 
     international court.


            Protecting Americans&#x27; right to financial privacy

       President Biden released a framework to evaluate the 
     establishment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), 
     which can be used as a surveillance tool and weaponized 
     against the American people.
       In China, the Communist Party has been using a CBDC to 
     track the spending habits of its citizens and we cannot allow 
     this level of financial surveillance in America.
       That&#x27;s why I cast NC-11&#x27;s vote for the CBDC Anti-
     Surveillance State Act. This bill protects Americans&#x27; right 
     to financial privacy by halting unelected bureaucrats from 
     issuing a CBDC and is the first anti-central bank digital 
     currency legislative effort ever introduced in Congress.


                           WNC Backs the Blue

       During the past three years, the Defund the Police movement 
     and anti-police policies have led to a surge in violent crime 
     across the country.
       In the U.S. House of Representatives, we recently 
     celebrated National Police Week and honored America&#x27;s law 
     enforcement heroes by passing legislation to support our men 
     and women in blue.
       Some of the bills that I voted for to support our police 
     officers include bills that would:
       Require ICE to detain illegal immigrants who are arrested, 
     charged or convicted with assaulting a law enforcement 
     officer or other first responder.
       Make sure officers can protect themselves and others by 
     allowing concealed weapon possession in more areas open to 
     the public.
       Direct the attorney general to report to Congress on how 
     the border crisis affects law enforcement at various levels.
       Make sure there is adequate data collection to address the 
     rise of attacks on police officers.
       While this year&#x27;s police week might be over, I will 
     continue to back policies that support America&#x27;s law 
     enforcement officers who risk their own lives to protect and 
     serve citizens day after day.


    House committee investigates China&#x27;s role in the fentanyl crisis

       Following a months-long bipartisan investigation, the House 
     Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 
     revealed its findings of the CCP&#x27;s role in the deadly 
     fentanyl epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of 
     Americans.
       The fentanyl crisis is one of the most devastating 
     disasters that our nation has faced and has made its way to 
     the mountains of Western North Carolina. Fentanyl kills more 
     than 200 Americans daily on average, which is the equivalent 
     to a packed Boeing 737 crashing every single day. After all, 
     the amount of fentanyl that is considered a potentially 
     deadly dose is as small as the amount that fits on the tip of 
     a pencil.
       This dangerous drug is the leading cause of death for 
     Americans aged 18-49 and has led to millions more suffering 
     from addiction while continuing to destroy families and 
     communities. The fentanyl crisis is not just limited to the 
     United States, as fentanyl and other mass-produced synthetic 
     narcotics from the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) are 
     devastating nations around the world.
       This is why the U.S. must swiftly act on the following 
     findings from the select committee&#x27;s investigation to address 
     the root cause of this global crisis.
       The select committee&#x27;s investigation found that the PRC 
     government, under the control of the CCP:
       Directly subsidizes the manufacturing and export of illicit 
     fentanyl materials and other synthetic narcotics through tax 
     rebates.
       Gave monetary grants and awards to companies openly 
     trafficking illicit fentanyl materials and other synthetic 
     narcotics.
       Holds ownership interest in several PRC companies tied to 
     drug trafficking.
       Fails to prosecute fentanyl and precursor manufacturers.
       Allows the open sale of fentanyl precursors and other 
     illicit materials on the extensively monitored and controlled 
     PRC internet.
       Censors content about domestic drug sales but leaves 
     export-focused narcotics content untouched.
       Strategically and economically benefits from the fentanyl 
     crisis.
       The takeaways from these findings are that the U.S. needs 
     to take the following decisive actions to address the 
     fentanyl crisis: establish a Joint Task Force--Counter 
     Opioids; provide law enforcement and intelligence officials 
     with the authorities, tools and resources they need; 
     strengthen U.S. sanctions authorities; enact and use trade 
     and customs enforcement measures and close regulatory and 
     enforcement gaps.


Inflation continues to wreak havoc on Western North Carolinians&#x27; way of 
                                  life

       Our economy continues to suffer due to this 
     administration&#x27;s fiscal policies.
       Inflation was at 1.4 percent when Biden took office and has 
     risen nearly 20 percent since then. High prices are forcing 
     Americans to spend more than $12,000 more a year to afford 
     the same basics compared to three years ago.
       From my seats on the House Appropriations and Budget 
     Committees, I am pushing to change how Washington works so 
     that we can restore fiscal responsibility in our government, 
     improve America&#x27;s economic outlook and allow Western North 
     Carolinians to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in 
     their wallets.


                WNC&#x27;s latest service academy acceptances

       One of the most important duties and greatest honors of 
     representing the 11th district of North Carolina is selecting 
     nominees among those who are seeking appointments to our 
     nation&#x27;s military service academies.
       I had the great pleasure and excitement of hosting an event 
     to celebrate the following students whose exceptional 
     leadership, hard work and patriotism made them stand out from 
     a competitive pool of applicants and were accepted into their 
     respective service academies.
       Cedric Gordon, alumnus of Asheville High School: U.S. Air 
     Force Academy
       William ``Liam&#x27;&#x27; Lawing, student at Nesbitt Discovery 
     Academy: U.S. Air Force Academy
       Joshua Morgan, alumnus of Asheville Christian Academy: U.S. 
     Air Force Academy
       Michael Puzerewski, student at Holy Innocence Academy: U.S. 
     Merchant Marine Academy
       Anita Zavyalova, student at A.C. Reynolds High School: U.S. 
     Naval Academy
       These students represent the best of America, and I want to 
     extend my congratulations once again for this life-changing 
     achievement.


                  Congressman Chuck Edwards: Unplugged

       Mark your calendars for Thursday, June 20 to join my next 
     in-person town hall in Graham County. The town hall will take 
     place from 6:00-7:30 p.m. at the Graham County Courthouse, 12 
     N. Main St., Robbinsville, NC. I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing 
     an update about legislative priorities in Congress and 
     answering questions about the issues that matter to you.
           With my warmest regards,
                                                    Chuck Edwards,
                                               Member of Congress.

  Mr. JACKSON of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I missed a 
vote on H.R. 192, a bill to prohibit individuals who are not citizens 
of the United States from voting in elections in the District of 
Columbia. Had I been present on the House floor, I would have voted 
AYE.

               RECOGNIZING JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 24, 2024

  Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jewish American 
Heritage Month. Our Nation benefits from the historical achievements 
and diversity of Jewish people every day, and I am proud to join many 
of my colleagues in celebrating May as Jewish American Heritage Month.
  Since first immigrating to the United States in 1654, Jewish 
Americans have accomplished countless achievements. Great minds, such 
as Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elie Wiesel, have made irrevocable impacts 
on both our culture and society. The Jewish American people continue to 
make our Nation proud by serving in the highest ranks of our military, 
achieving groundbreaking advancements in science, revolutionizing music 
and art, and much more.
  My community of Rochester, NY, is steeped in Jewish culture. Since 
the mid-1800&#x27;s, Jewish families have settled in the region, making 
Rochester their home for generations to come. Over more than 175 years, 
Rochester&#x27;s Jewish community has played an integral role in the growth 
and development of our city and surrounding towns. Today, key Jewish 
community institutions work to enrich the lives of Rochester&#x27;s Jewish 
and non-Jewish citizens. It is an honor to recognize this vibrant 
community for their devotion to Rochester&#x27;s success and stability.
  Throughout history, the Jewish people have proven to be resilient in 
their fight against persecution. It is inspiring that they continue to 
persevere regardless of the difficulties they face. To ensure their 
heritage remains preserved, we must continue to educate our youth on 
the extensive history of the Jewish people and their diverse cultural 
achievements.
  While we are celebrating the contributions of the Jewish American 
people, we must also acknowledge the challenging times they face. Many 
of our Jewish brothers and sisters are impacted by the dramatic 
increase in antisemitism nationwide. As allies of our Jewish neighbors, 
we must condemn this discriminatory behavior in every instance and 
demand justice for those affected. The Jewish people are all too aware 
of the dangers that occur if hate goes unchecked. We must not and will 
not allow history to repeat itself.
  As a devoted friend of the Jewish community, I am proud to raise my 
voice in recognition of Jewish American Heritage month, and I look 
forward to many more years of celebrating the accomplishments and 
legacies of Jewish Americans.

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                           HON. JOYCE BEATTY

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 21, 2024

  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark the solemn anniversary of 
George Floyd&#x27;s untimely passing--a moment etched in history that shook 
our Nation to its core and reverberated across the globe, igniting a 
resounding call for justice. As we reflect on this time, we cannot 
overlook the profound pain and anguish endured by George Floyd&#x27;s loved 
ones and the countless individuals whose lives have been unjustly cut 
short by police violence.
  Yet, within this sorrow lies hope--a hope fueled by a resilient 
movement that refuses to relent until systemic change is realized. This 
movement, driven by tireless activists, organizers, and everyday 
citizens, rejects the status quo that devalues Black lives and 
perpetuates injustice.
  As lawmakers, we bear a solemn responsibility to heed the impassioned 
cries for reform and to enact meaningful change. That is why I implore 
my esteemed colleagues in the U.S. House and Senate to swiftly pass the 
reintroduced George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. This crucial 
legislation transcends mere policy; it serves as a beacon of hope for a 
more just and equitable future, holding accountable those who betray 
the trust bestowed upon them and empowering law enforcement with the 
necessary tools to serve communities with fairness and integrity.
  Currently, with over 18,000 police departments operating under 
varying standards, our Nation faces a disjointed approach to policing 
that breeds inconsistency and erodes public trust. The George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act addresses this patchwork of pain, ushering in 
meaningful reforms to root out systemic racism and police brutality and 
prioritizing the sanctity of human life.
  Though the passage of time may dull the immediacy of George Floyd&#x27;s 
tragic death, the urgency for meaningful change remains undiminished. 
Let us honor his memory not with fleeting tributes, but with unwavering 
commitment to enact reform and forge a society where every individual 
is treated with dignity and respect under the law.

 THANKING JOANN FARLEY FOR HER SERVICE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JOHN P. SARBANES

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 24, 2024

  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank my constituent, Joann 
Farley, who is retiring on May 31, 2024 after over 21 years of 
outstanding service to the House of Representatives in financial 
administrative and support roles. Joann lives in Annapolis, MD, and I 
am proud to represent her here in Congress.
  Joann is retiring after having lent her talents and skills to the 
Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for over two decades. The daughter 
of a U. S. Army soldier. Joann grew up on several Army bases and 
eventually landed in Marina, CA, where she started her federal career 
as an aide for the Supply Department of the Naval Postgraduate School. 
In August 1982, she met a young Navy Lieutenant, Norm Farley of 
Annapolis, MD, who decided then and there that he wanted to marry her, 
and the two married in 1984. As a Navy wife moving from base to base, 
she continued her career in various positions with the Navy, IRS, Army 
Research Center and Department of Veterans Affairs. She and Norm were 
blessed with three children: Laura in 1989, Jared in 1992 and Jacob in 
2000. Eventually the family landed in the Washington. D.C. area. where 
Joann worked for the Department of the Air Force, the Naval Academy and 
the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration.
  In March 2003, Joann began her career with the CAO as a Vendor 
Management and Financial Counselor, processing payments and providing 
financial services and optimization of resources to House offices to 
ensure adherence to House rules and regulations. She managed and 
enforced over 50 vendor contracts to ensure swift and comprehensive 
vendor response, safeguarding House terms and conditions. Her 
knowledge, experience and courteous attentiveness enabled her to be an 
invaluable asset to the House of Representatives. Joann also formed 
long-lasting friendships with her customers and colleagues, among whom 
she is well respected and will be dearly missed.
  Joann became a proud grandmother in 2019 when Laura gave birth to 
twins Lilyana and CeCe, and later, granddaughter Raina was born in 
2023. She and Norm recently purchased a home in Cape Coral, FL, where 
Joann will enjoy her retirement spending time with her family, pursuing 
various creative and home improvement projects, and enjoying winters in 
sunny Florida as a `snowbird.&#x27;
  I congratulate Joann on her retirement and I ask my colleagues to 
join me in thanking her for her distinguished service to the House and 
our Nation. I wish her all the best as she begins a new chapter in her 
life.
