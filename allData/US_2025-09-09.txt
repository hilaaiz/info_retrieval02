I am pleased to congratulate and recognize 
the Lancaster County Conservation District (LCCD) on their 75th 
anniversary.
  In 1950, the Lancaster County Conservation District, then called the 
Soil Conservation District, was officially incorporated by the county. 
Though the Conservation District had officially been organized since 
1938, it only covered the southern part of Lancaster County. The new 
organization was wholly operated by its volunteer board until they 
hired their first employee in 1965.
  The Lancaster County Conservation District raises awareness of 
environmental challenges and helps individuals and organizations with 
navigating them. Three quarters of a century since its founding, the 
LCCD has moved beyond its original scope of soil conservation. New 
programs include an erosion and sedimentation program, which helps to 
protect water quality, educational programs such as the Youth 
Conservation School and the Envirothon, their own Chesapeake Bay and 
watershed programs, an annual tree sale, and much more.
  Just as important is the LCCDs collaboration with farmers and the 
local community, which makes everything they do possible. Farmers work 
with the LCCD because better agronomics and better environmental 
practices are intertwined. The LCCD also builds inroads with farmers to 
increase environmental awareness. An example of this is their Plain 
Sect program, which provides outreach to the local Amish and Mennonite 
communities, which comprise a significant portion of the farms in the 
district.
  With the dedication of 40 employees, the LCCD leads the way in soil 
conservation and water quality. We owe our beautiful scenery and 
quality of life in part to the LCCD, which is why I am grateful for 
their work in Pennsylvanias 11th Congressional District. 
Congratulations to the Lancaster County Conservation District on 75 
years, and I wish them many more years of success.
I rise today to honor Reverend Dr. 
William Crowder on his appointment as the next Regional Minister and 
President of the Living Waters Region of the Christian Church 
(Disciples of Christ).
  Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Reverend Dr. Crowder was 
inspired by his mother, who instilled in him a deep sense of faith, 
discipline, and service. As a young man, he distinguished himself both 
as a student leader, serving as student government vice president and 
president at Central State University, and as an athlete, helping lead 
his football team to a championship.
  Answering his call to ministry, Dr. Crowder entered United 
Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio. He was licensed by the Christian 
Church (Disciples of Christ) in 1994 and ordained the following year.
  Since then, Dr. Crowder has devoted his life to ministry and service, 
impacting communities far beyond the pulpit. Working alongside lay 
leaders of Park Manor and the City of Chicago, he helped bring forward 
a $34 million senior housing project, secured a $1 million state grant 
to combat gun violence, and contributed his time and insight on 
numerous distinguished boards. Through these efforts, he has lived out 
his calling to serve others and to strengthen the communities around 
him.
  Reverend Dr. William Crowders appointment is a testament to his 
lifelong devotion to faith and service. His leadership has strengthened 
congregations, uplifted communities, and left a lasting impact on 
Chicago and beyond.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Reverend 
.
I rise today to commend the remarkable history 
and service of the Delaware Valley Food Pantry in Lambertville, 
Hunterdon County.
  For 70 years, this pantry has been a lifeline for families 
experiencing food insecurity in the Lambertville and New Hope 
communities. Since 1955, its dedicated volunteers have ensured that 
everyone who walks through its

doors feels welcomed, supported, and part of a caring community. An 
entirely volunteer-run organization, the pantry serves more than 1,000 
individuals each month, generously giving their time to meet the needs 
of their neighbors.
  As we celebrate seven decades of service, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the volunteers and community members whose dedication 
has made the Delaware Valley Food Pantry a lasting success and will 
continue to keep families fed for many years to come.
I am honored to celebrate Alexander John 
Scalice of Galloway Township, whose hard work and dedication have 
earned him the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest distinction in the Boy 
Scouts of America.
  Throughout his Scouting journey, Alex earned an impressive 40 merit 
badges in areas ranging from science, citizenship and communications, 
as well as serving in elected leadership roles within his troop. For 
his Eagle project, Alex designed and built six oar carriers for the 
Cedar Creek High School Crew team, where he proudly rowed for four 
years. Recognizing the financial challenges faced by the program, he 
secured donations from local businesses and individual supporters, 
organized a team of volunteers, and led them in completing this 
project. His work not only solved a practical problem for his teammates 
but also provided equipment that will support the program for many 
seasons to come. His commitment to service extended beyond Scouting. 
Alex volunteered many hours with his church and community, earning two 
Catholic Scouting emblems, demonstrating his devotion to both faith and 
country. As he prepares to study Biology and Pre-Med in college, Alex 
stands a role model for young people across South Jersey and a source 
of pride for his family, his troop, and our community.
  I congratulate Alex on this outstanding achievement. God bless Alex 
and God bless

our United States of America. The greatest country on the face of the 
Earth.
I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Andrew 
``Andy C. Mack of Londonderry, New Hampshire, a steadfast pillar for 
his community who will be remembered for his commitment to service and 
his great generosity.
  Raised in Londonderry, New Hampshire, Andy was a Granite Stater 
through and through. Earlier in his life, he served his country 
honorably in the Army Chemical Corps before returning to Londonderry. 
Whether as a town moderator, volunteer firefighter, or Derry Rotarian, 
Andy spent his life working for the greater good of his neighbors and 
his town. He had a vibrant civic life and was known for his handmade, 
plywood road signs, which boldly shared his views on a variety of 
topics.
  The passing on of Andys property is just one of many remarkable 
examples of his dedication to the people around him. After being owned 
by his family for seven generations, Andy eventually sold his family 
farm to the town of Londonderry. In doing so, he made sure that the 
land would be used for local schools, civic organizations, and nature 
conservation.
  Andys passing is a profound loss to Londonderry, but I know that his 
legacy will live on through those who knew and loved him, including his 
sons, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. His life offers 
inspiration to Granite Staters across New Hampshire who care about and 
aspire to make change in their communities. I am grateful for his 
memory and for the lasting impact Andy has made on our state.
I was unable to attend votes on September 8, 
2025.
  Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 240, and 
YEA on Roll Call No. 241.
I rise today to recognize the service and 
commitment of the Chester First Aid Squad. Since 1945, the Chester 
First Aid Squad has provided exceptional care in times of need. For 80 
years, these volunteers have provided free and professional support to 
the people of Chester and to neighboring communities during medical 
emergencies. The squad has logged thousands of hours administering 
emergency assistance to others exemplifying the spirit of sacrifice and 
volunteerism that embody New Jerseys 7th Congressional District.
  I ask my colleagues today to join me in commending this exemplary 
organization and congratulating them on 80 years of extraordinary 
community service.
it is truly an honor to recognize 
Councilwoman Patricia Andaloro for her many years of devoted service to 
the people of Buena Borough. She was recently celebrated at the Buena 
Boro Republican League dinner, a well-earned recognition of her 
dedication, integrity, and steadfast commitment to her community. Pat 
first served as the Borough Clerk, where she became the backbone of 
local government. In that role, she guided residents and colleagues 
alike with professionalism and care, ensuring that the daily functions 
of the borough ran smoothly. Her attention to detail and her deep 
knowledge of municipal operations earned her the respect and trust of 
everyone who worked alongside her.
  Today, as Councilwoman, Pat continues to bring that same spirit of 
service and leadership. She has shown an unwavering commitment to good 
governance, always keeping the needs of her neighbors at the forefront. 
The recognition she received at the Buena Boro Republican League dinner 
was not just a tribute to her past accomplishments, but a reminder of 
the lasting impact she continues to make. I congratulate Pat on a very 
well-deserved honor and I thank her for the great work she is doing in 
South Jersey. God bless Pat and God bless our United States of America. 
The greatest country on the face of the Earth.
it is with great pride that I recognize 
Madeline Miller of Logan Township, who at just sixteen years old has 
earned the rank of Eagle Scout, a distinction achieved by only a small 
percentage of Scouts nationwide. At such a young age, Madeline has 
already shown remarkable dedication, leadership, and service. For her 
Eagle project, she designed and built dog play

equipment at the Triple Seven Animal Rescue in Elmer, South Jersey, 
creating a doghouse tunnel, hurdle, and even re-purposing a fire 
hydrant to provide a lasting space for the animals in their care. 
Madeline is currently a student at Padua Academy, an institution known 
for preparing young women through a strong Catholic education rooted in 
academic excellence and community service. She is a role model for her 
peers, and her Eagle rank reflects not only her perseverance but also 
her deep commitment to faith, service, and community.
  I congratulate Madeline on this spectacular accomplishment and I look 
forward to seeing what else she achieves. God bless Madeline and God 
bless our United States of America. The greatest country on the face of 
the Earth.
I rise to recognize the Leadership and Staff 
of JPS Health Network.
  On the occasion of the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new 
Psychiatric Emergency Center, I extend my deepest congratulations and 
recognition on behalf of the people of the 33rd Congressional District.
  This remarkable facility represents more than bricks and mortar--it 
is a testament to vision, leadership, and an unwavering commitment to 
meeting one of our communitys most urgent needs. By tripling capacity 
and providing 24/7 specialized behavioral health services for both 
adults and adolescents, JPS is not only expanding access to care but 
also affirming the dignity, safety, and hope that every individual 
deserves.
  As Tarrant Countys only psychiatric emergency center--and one of the 
busiest in the Nation--the opening of this center is a milestone in 
advancing compassionate, high-quality care. It reflects the dedication 
of the JPS leadership team, the skill and perseverance of the staff, 
and the broad collaboration that made this achievement possible.
  I commend them for their service to our community, and I look forward 
to the positive impact this facility will have on countless patients, 
families, and first responders in the years to come.
I rise today to honor Kate OConnor Harper 
for her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
  A native of Chicago, Illinois and a graduate of the University of 
Chicago, Kate began her career as a Staff Assistant for Senator Mark 
Kirk (IL) before becoming Legislative Assistant and Correspondent for 
Senator Dan Sullivan (AK). In 2018, Kate joined President Trumps 
administration serving as Deputy Director of Legislative and 
Intergovernmental Affairs for the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration where she proved to be a valuable asset and 
became Chief of Staff in 2019. Later that year, Kate returned to 
Capitol Hill to become Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on 
Communications and Technology for the House Committee on Energy and 
Commerce under Ranking Member Greg Walden. She continued to lead in 
this role under Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers and when I became 
Chairman, I knew I wanted to have her at the helm of this subcommittee. 
Under her leadership, her team passed historic legislation including 
the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversaries Act and the 
reauthorization of the FCCs spectrum auction authority.
  After serving three Chairmen and two Subcommittee Chairmen, Kate will 
soon depart Capitol Hill to work in the private sector as a 
telecommunications expert. I wish her the best, congratulate her on her 
new role, and thank Kate OConnor Harper for her service to the House 
Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States Congress.
I rise today to recognize the 30th 
anniversary of the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation in El Paso, Texas.
  Established in 1995, the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation has worked 
to ensure our binational tri-state community has the knowledge, 
resources, and support needed to lead healthy and productive lives.
  For three decades, the foundation has partnered with countless local 
and national organizations to address some of the most critical 
challenges in the borderland--from chronic disease prevention, 
expanding mental health support, and helping develop the next 
generation of healthcare leaders.
  The PDNHF has supported local governments, non-profits and 
educational institutions to promote health and the well-being of our 
community. Over its 30-year history, the PDNHF has helped reduce 
smoking, promoted diabetes awareness and increased physical activity 
and healthy eating, created a medical forgivable loan fund, programing 
to support oral health, support for the community through the COVID-19 
pandemic, and support in growing El Pasos quality of life assets.
  The community is grateful for PDNHFs investment in our region and 
congratulates the board and staff committed to this mission. I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in celebrating the incredible legacy of the 
Paso Del Norte Health Foundation.
I rise today to offer a warm 
welcome to His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the 
spiritual leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians throughout the 
world and the current Archbishop of Constantinople, serving in one of 
the oldest sees in Christendom. This month, Patriarch Bartholomew will 
visit Washington, D.C., where he will be recognized as this years 
recipient of the prestigious Templeton Prize, an award that has been 
garnered in the past by great historical figures such as Mother Teresa, 
the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
  In his previous visits to the United States, His All Holiness has had 
visitations with five Presidents, he has spoken to both houses of 
Congress and has been awarded the Congressional Gold Medal; the highest 
award that civilian Congress can bestow. His next trip will maintain 
that longstanding tradition of friendship between the United States and 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
  It is Patriarch Bartholomews life that embodies ethical and 
principled leadership and the patriarchs perseverance that became 
proverbial. Fluent in seven languages and a holder of several 
doctorates in Canon Law, he has tirelessly championed the cause of 
religious freedom, inter-faith dialogue and environmental 
responsibility--earning the endearing nickname ``the Green Patriarch, 
by stating that damaging Gods creation is a sin.
  At a time when religious persecution, catastrophes and tensions among 
religious communities seem to be dominating news headlines, Patriarch 
Bartholomew presents an alternate vision: ``War in the name of religion 
is war against religion, he tells us. He calls on people of faith of 
all traditions to be ``peacemakers and protectors of the Earth.
  There are thousands of Greek-Americans living in Arizonas 8th 
Congressional District, including the hundreds of faithful at St. 
Haralambos Greek Orthodox Church in Peoria. They, and Orthodox 
Christians throughout our land, welcome this visit with joy. My 
constituents are particularly proud of the fact that Patriarch 
Bartholomew has been an outspoken defender of human dignity and has 
reached out to Jewish and Muslim leaders throughout the world.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming His All-
Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C., and in 
paying tribute to his decades of ministry for peace, reconciliation and 
environmental stewardship. May God continue to bestow his example as a 
guide to defend religious freedom, choose cooperation over conflict, 
and secure a healthier, safer America for future generations.
