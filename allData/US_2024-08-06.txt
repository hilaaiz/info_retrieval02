                  COMMEMORATING NATIONAL PARALEGAL DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEVIN HERN

                              of oklahoma

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of our Nation&#x27;s 
paralegal professionals.

[[Page E804]]

  Paralegals have been in use in the legal profession for nearly 60 
years. These individuals are hard workers, held to the highest ethical 
standards, and provide essential support in legal offices.
  Anyone in business knows that your business is only as strong as the 
people who work there. Support is a vital part of the foundation of any 
success; within the legal ecosystem, paralegals play a vital part in 
building and sustaining that foundation.
  ``Liberty and justice for all&#x27;&#x27; is more than just a line in our 
national Pledge of Allegiance--it&#x27;s the day-in, day-out mission for 
those in the legal profession. Paralegals are essential to that 
profession, working in government agencies, corporations, law firms, 
and more.
  Many professions are honored with a day of recognition. I am thrilled 
to commemorate this first National Paralegal Day on August 6, 2024.
  I thank our Nation&#x27;s paralegals for their tireless and inspiring work 
and hope it will encourage others to pursue a career in this honorable 
field.

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize 
Amy Boyette, Director of the Office of External Affairs at the 
Department of Energy&#x27;s Savannah River Site, on her retirement after 32 
years of federal service with the Site.
  Her remarkable career at SRS has witnessed many groundbreaking 
accomplishments in the history of the department, state, and nation 
that contribute to both our national security and environmental 
stewardship. From her service as liaison to the Defense Nuclear 
Facilities Safety Board to managing the U.S. Origin Nuclear Material 
Removal Program, her journey has been marked by dedication, excellence, 
and an unwavering commitment to public service.
  Beyond her professional commitments, Amy&#x27;s kindness, mentorship, and 
support for her colleagues and the community have created a legacy that 
will undoubtedly be an inspiration for many to follow.
  I know her son, Nick Poston, parents, Milton and Shirley, her 
colleagues, and the citizens of both South Carolina and Georgia share 
my appreciation for her contributions to our states and service for 
Americans.
  Congratulations to Amy on a truly remarkable career and best wishes 
on her future success.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect and honor Mr. 
Stanley Graham Tate, a champion of real estate, business, and education 
in Florida, who sadly passed away at the age of 96 on July 26, 2024.
  Mr. Tate was not just a real estate mogul, but a visionary whose 
successful ventures transformed the real estate landscape, particularly 
in Miami Beach. His entrepreneurial spirit continues to inspire us all. 
In addition to his real estate career, Mr. Tate&#x27;s business acumen was 
instrumental during a crucial period when the government needed his 
skills. As the Southeast Regional Director of The Resolution Trust 
Corporation, a federal agency established to address the Savings and 
Loans financial crisis, Mr. Tate&#x27;s invaluable contributions helped the 
United States overcome these financial challenges.
  One of Mr. Tate&#x27;s greatest legacies is the creation of the Stanley G. 
Tate Florida Prepaid College Program. This program, founded in 1987, 
has been a beacon of hope for countless students in Florida, providing 
them with the opportunity to pursue higher education. Mr. Tate&#x27;s 
foresight and dedication to educational equality have been invaluable 
to the community, and his legacy lives on in the lives of the students 
who have benefited from his college savings plan.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in commemorating Mr. Stanley Graham 
Tate&#x27;s life and legacy. His achievements will undoubtedly be cherished 
by the numerous lives he has impacted, and he will be dearly missed.

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mr. MIKE GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Thomas Dierckman, a beloved member of CA-27&#x27;s community and an integral 
district staffer who has been with me since I was first elected to 
Congress.
  Tom&#x27;s life of public service began as a teenager where he spent time 
away from cowboying to become an Eagle Scout. Later, at the University 
of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, he earned his degree in Mechanical 
Engineering. Consistent with Tom&#x27;s dedication to his community, he used 
his training as an engineer to give back to his country. He was 
commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy after college and joined the 
Civil Engineer Corps.
  During Tom&#x27;s service as a Naval Officer, he did his part in every 
community where the

[[Page E806]]

Navy brought him. For example, he coached basketball at his first duty 
station in Yokosuka, Japan, and was a public works officer at the Naval 
Regional Medical Center in Oakland, CA, where he taught Civil Engineer 
Corps students.
  While Tom&#x27;s tenacity took no days off, he always made time for his 
family and those most important to him. Following Tom&#x27;s marriage to his 
wife, Sandy, in 1976 and the birth of his two sons, he left active duty 
in 1982 and stayed in the reserves for another 17 years. Tom resigned 
from the Armed Forces with the rank of Captain in 1999.
  After he resigned his commission as an active-duty Naval Officer, he 
moved to Southern California and joined the Newhall Land and Farming 
Company where he was responsible for all aspects of residential, 
commercial, and industrial development. In 1990, he was named Senior 
Vice President and retired in 2004.
  Since the 80s, Tom has been an integral part of our community. He 
served on the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles County Economic 
Development Corp., Valencia Water Co., Castaic Lake Water Agency, and 
Valencia Bank and Trust. Tom was also a board member of the College of 
the Canyons Foundation, a director emeritus of the COC Foundation, and 
president of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of the Santa Clarita Valley. In 
short, Tom&#x27;s been busy.
  For his work in our community, Tom has earned the Silver Spur Award 
for Community Service, the Boys &amp; Girls Club&#x27;s Samuel Dixon Award for 
extraordinary service, as well as being named Santa Clarita Valley Man 
of the Year in 2012.
  My path crossed Tom&#x27;s because of his desire to make an impact on the 
next generation in our community. Tom worked tirelessly to help 
nominate the emerging military leaders of our district. Over his 
tenure, he walked with 41 students as they navigated the application 
and nomination process to our Nation&#x27;s great military academies. I 
thank Tom for his dedication in making sure that our academies receive 
the best of the best and for his critical role in a stronger, more 
secure future for this great Nation.
  I am forever grateful for Tom&#x27;s steadfast dedication to our community 
and the work he has done as part of my team. Tom&#x27;s approach to life is 
a powerful example to us all of what it means to pay it forward.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE PROMOTING HEALTHIER LIFELONG IMPROVEMENTS IN FOOD 
                        AND EXERCISE ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduced the Promoting Healthier 
Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise Act of 2024, or the LIFE 
Act, which would establish a national program to combat overweight and 
obesity, a major health problem in the United States that cannot be 
remedied through the health care system alone. Increasing rates of 
overweight and obesity are found among Americans of every age, race, 
and major demographic group, and threaten the health of Americans like 
no other condition or disease. In fact, the key to reducing or 
eliminating many of the most serious health conditions is not only to 
reduce overweight and obesity but also to encourage exercise of all 
kinds.
  This bill would provide $75 million to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) for a coordinated national effort to 
reverse increasingly sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets. 
Specifically, the CDC, either directly or through grants and contracts, 
would train health professionals to recognize the signs of overweight 
and obesity early in order to educate patients about proper nutrition 
and regular exercise; conduct public education campaigns about how to 
recognize and address overweight and obesity; and develop intervention 
strategies for use in everyday life, such as in the workplace and 
community settings.
  The National Survey of Children&#x27;s Health found that 17 percent of 
children ages 10 to 17 had obesity in 2020-2021. The CDC National 
Center for Health Statistics reports that Type 2 diabetes, once 
considered an adult disease, is now widespread among children. The 
rising cost of the health care system, including insurance premiums, 
reflects this epidemic. Today, chronic diseases, many of which are 
caused or exacerbated by overweight and obesity, account for 70 percent 
of all deaths in the U.S. and 75 percent of U.S. medical care costs, 
according to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and 
Health Promotion. The national program established by this bill would 
provide a model for states and local governments to establish similar 
programs.
  To cite an example of the need for action, the District of Columbia 
is one of the fittest cities in the U.S., according to a 2023 study by 
the American College of Sports Medicine, yet, even here, obesity 
continues to be a severe problem. Approximately one-fifth of D.C. 
residents are considered obese. Most of the obesity epidemic is 
exercise- and food-related.
  I urge support for this bill to mobilize the country before entirely 
preventable health conditions, which often begin in childhood, 
overwhelm the Nation&#x27;s health care system.

               NEWSLETTER FROM CONGRESSMAN CHUCK EDWARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents on issues surrounding 
the attempted Trump assassination and Israel:

       Dear Friend,
       I voted in favor of H. Res. 1367, Establishing the Task 
     Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, 
     which would fully examine all actions related to the 
     attempted assassination.
       Our nation was shaken by the assassination attempt on 
     President Trump, which tragically took the life of Corey 
     Comperatore.
       It has become clear since then that numerous security flaws 
     and failures made it possible for the gunman to open file on 
     President Trump.
       The American people deserve transparency and 
     accountability. We must make sure that what happened at the 
     rally in Butler, Pennsylvania does not happen again.
       Kimberly Cheatle, who just resigned as director of the 
     United States Secret Service, refused to voluntarily provide 
     answers that would allow us to figure out what went wrong. 
     The United States Secret Service has a no-fail mission, but 
     it failed when the shooter attempted to assassinate President 
     Trump, took the life of an innocent victim and harmed others.
       A comprehensive investigation is necessary to understand 
     what went wrong that day so we can learn how to prevent this 
     from happening in the future.
       While obvious security gaps were present, I commend the 
     bravery of the individual Secret Service agents, local law 
     enforcement, and Emergency Medical Services, who took 
     immediate action to protect and care for President Trump.


                       America stands with Israel

       As Israel continues to fight for its right to exist, I 
     remain committed to supporting one of our staunchest Middle 
     Eastern allies.
       Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
     addressed a joint meeting of Congress where he eloquently and 
     directly addressed the world on why Israel has the right and 
     must defend itself and what the implications are for world 
     peace and stability.
       While the House of Representatives has stood with Israel, 
     many on the radical left have turned their back on Israel. 
     They have chosen to withhold critical military aid that is 
     necessary for Israel to defend itself and defeat the 
     terrorist organization, Hamas, and have instead sided with 
     pro-Hamas leftists.
       As an embarrassment to the traditions of joint sessions of 
     Congress, Vice President Kamala Harris skipped Netanyahu&#x27;s at 
     a time when it has never been more critical to show the world 
     that America stands firmly with our ally.
       Some of the major bills I helped pass in support of Israel 
     following the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7 include measures 
     to:
       Provide an additional $14.1 billion in emergency 
     appropriations in support of Israel&#x27;s efforts to defend 
     itself against Iran and Iran&#x27;s terrorist proxies, and to 
     replenish U.S. defense assets in the region.
       Strengthen U S sanctions against Iran.
       Condemn the International Criminal Court&#x27;s decision to file 
     applications for arrest warrants against Prime Minister 
     Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
       Create a legal definition of antisemitism to protect Jewish 
     people and students on college campuses facing 
     discrimination.
       U.S.-Israel relations are not only vital to providing 
     stability in perhaps the most volatile region of the world, 
     but our principles and values are closely aligned, and the 
     U.S. must not waver in our ironclad support for Israel.


                         WNC wins in WRDA 2024

       Even more positive news for our district: The House passed 
     the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2024, which 
     includes two of my bills, the National Dam Safety Program 
     Amendment Act and the Low-Head Dam Inventory Act.
       The passage of this legislation benefits Western North 
     Carolina by strengthening dam safety for the more than 750 
     dams in out district and providing funding to improve water 
     and wastewater infrastructure.
       The following projects are included in WRDA 2024:
       Authorization of $41 million for water and wastewater 
     infrastructure, including stormwater management in Canton
       Authorization of more than $3 million for water and 
     wastewater infrastructure in Robbinsville
       Authorization of $4 million for water and wastewater 
     infrastructure in Weaverville
       Authorization of $1.5 million for water and wastewater 
     infrastructure, including water supply in Murphy
       Army Corps of Engineers study on flood risk management, 
     including riverbank stabilization, along the Catawba River in 
     Marion
       Army Corps of Engineers study on flood risk management 
     along the Pigeon River in Clyde and Canton


                Military Veteran Stand Down Celebration

       Veterans have made great sacrifices to defend our freedom, 
     and it is only right that we now serve them by supporting 
     their transition to civilian life.
       I was blown away by the turnout and involvement of everyone 
     who participated in the Military Veteran Stand Down 
     Celebration that I hosted with Henderson County.
       More than 130 folks attended the event, and 21 resource 
     vendors were available to share how they can assist veterans.
       I appreciate all who showed up for our veterans and 
     military families who have made great sacrifices to serve and 
     protect us.


        Attention: Military Service Academy Day is on August 17

       My office will be hosting a Military Service Academy Day on 
     August 17 in Haywood County for WNC high school students to 
     learn about the application and nomination process for 
     military service academies. I look forward to meeting 
     students who are interested in learning how they can advance 
     their academic and professional careers while serving our 
     great nation.
       Representatives from the service academies and members of 
     my team will be at the event to answer any questions.
       Visit my website for more information here.
           With my warmest regards,
                                                    Chuck Edwards,
                                               Member of Congress.

  Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep gratitude to Cameron 
Hull for her many years of service and exceptional work for Texas&#x27; 
Seventh Congressional District. After working for our district for more 
than 5\1/2\ years, Cameron will leave my office to attend graduate 
school at Harvard University, where she expects to earn a Master&#x27;s 
degree in Urban Planning.
  Cameron has served Texas&#x27; Seventh Congressional District for as long 
as I have, joining our district staff as a Staff Assistant in 
Washington, D.C. as we opened our office in January 2019. An integral 
part of my team from the start, she has worked tirelessly and 
effectively, handling issues of all kinds and engaging with our 
constituents in meaningful ways. As our office grew, so did Cameron&#x27;s 
role in it, as she moved from Staff Assistant to Legislative 
Correspondent to Legislative Assistant to Senior Legislative Assistant. 
She has worked on issues of great importance to our district with a 
portfolio that includes transportation, infrastructure, and flooding 
policy. It is fitting then that her work here has inspired her to 
pursue a career in urban planning.
  Throughout her more than 5 years serving our district, Cameron has 
demonstrated a real passion for improving Texas&#x27; Seventh Congressional 
District and the broader Houston region. She has built meaningful 
relationships across our community and has led the way on efforts to 
ensure our district&#x27;s and our region&#x27;s priorities are included in our 
work and that our work in Washington delivers meaningful progress back 
home.
  Outstanding in her policy work, Cameron was also an outstanding team 
member who always remained positive and supportive of her colleagues. 
Her work and her positive contributions have had--and will continue to 
have--a lasting impact on our team and on our district, and we will 
miss her.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Texas&#x27; Seventh Congressional District, I 
express my deep and sincere gratitude and best wishes to Cameron Hull 
as she continues her service to community and country in a new way and 
begins a new chapter this fall.

                                 ______

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Coach Kevin 
Fite, a resident of Detroit and the leader of the Detroit City Chess 
Club (DCCC). His efforts in ensuring that the Metro Detroit youth have 
a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment is worthy of 
commendation.
  The DCCC was born out of the competitive chess team at Detroit 
Duffield Elementary and Middle Schools in the early 2000s. Inspired by 
the interest of his students who wanted to continue their competitive 
playing after leaving Detroit Duffield, Coach Fite set up a meeting 
with the Detroit Institute of Arts to discuss using their space for his 
players. The meeting went well, and the DIA has been the host of the 
DCCC for the last 21 years.
  Over the years, the DCCC has grown from a few students from Detroit 
Duffield to reaching thousands of kids from all over the Metro Detroit 
area. DCCC not only reaches kids but has a large following of adults 
that regularly play every Friday evening. DCCC students have traveled 
all over the United States competing and winning National 
Championships. One of their star players, Charisse Woods, represented 
the United States two years in a row at the World Youth tournament in 
2018 (Greece) and 2019 (India). She is the first player in Detroit 
history to compete on the world stage.
  Detroit City Chess Club has also hosted the Thinkers series chess 
tournament for the last 10 years to provide kids in Metro Detroit the 
opportunity to hone their skills. Along with putting on tournaments, 
the DCCC has hosted many grandmasters to play games of give lectures, 
like 5-time U.S. champion Hikaru Nakamura and 7-time U.S. female 
champion Irina Krush.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring Coach 
Kevin Fite, a man who has been committed to improving the lives of the 
children who also call the city of Detroit home. His efforts over the 
last 20+ years is a glowing example of spreading kindness and joy in an 
increasingly hostile world. We thank him for his efforts, and we are 
excited to see what the students of the DCCC can accomplish over the 
next 21 years. I thank Coach Fite.

  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RANSOMVILLE VOLUNTEER FIRE 
                                COMPANY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations 
and recognize the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company, which is 
celebrating 100 years of excellence. This outstanding achievement is 
marked by the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company&#x27;s commitment to 
providing safe, efficient, and effective emergency services to the 
Ransomville Community and surrounding communities in Niagara County, 
New York.
  The Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company is located in the hamlet of 
Ransomville in the Town of Porter, in Niagara County, New York. The 
fire company&#x27;s stellar record of service began when it took on its 
first chartered members in March of 1924. At that time their first line 
of defense against fires was one hand drawn hose cart, which was 
popular among many departments in the early 1900s.
  Today, the fire company&#x27;s 53 members are tasked with protecting local 
schools, government buildings, and several farms and annually respond 
to over 600 calls. The members are not only limited to fighting fires, 
but they are also called upon to respond to motor vehicle accidents, 
hazardous material incidents, and medical emergencies.
  Although times have changed for the members of the Ransomville 
Volunteer Fire Company, the call to tirelessly safeguard the lives and 
property of citizens remains the same. These courageous volunteers 
leave their jobs, their hobbies, and their families at a moment&#x27;s 
notice to respond to danger and I cannot thank them enough for that. 
The residents who are served by the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company 
can rest comfortably knowing they will receive the best possible 
assistance.
  I am pleased to congratulate the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company 
for 100 years of protecting their community and recognize their 
continuing commitment to service.

                          ____________________

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Equality NC, which 
has a remarkable history as the oldest statewide organization in the 
country devoted to promoting LGBTQ rights.
  Through grassroots organizing, education, and advocacy, the 
organization has made landmark strides towards equality for everyone 
regardless of their lived and expressed identity.
  I appreciate Equality NC&#x27;s efforts to push for legislation that calls 
for nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender 
identity, and expression in housing, employment, public accommodations, 
credit, insurance, and education.
  One of their most notable achievements was leading the fight against 
HB2, a dangerous and discriminatory bill against the LGBTQ community 
that was later repealed after a successful public pressure campaign.
  Equality NC has time and time again supported North Carolinians from 
their work on HIV/AIDS education to providing youth programming.
  Through policy work and activism, Equality NC is leading the way 
towards a more equitable future for all North Carolinians.
  Please join me in supporting their efforts to make the world a safer 
place for everyone, no matter who they are or who they love.

     SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF WILLARD&#x27;S SESQUICENTENNIAL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT E. LATTA

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the City of 
Willard&#x27;s Sesquicentennial. The perseverance of pioneers and settlers 
to overcome the challenges faced during the early years of the city&#x27;s 
history has persisted throughout the past 150 years. The hard work and 
spirit shown by generations of city residents have made Willard an 
outstanding example of American ingenuity.
  In 1874, the City of Willard was established as a community and a 
junction for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s line to Sandusky and the 
branch west to Chicago. The original name of Willard was Chicago; 
however, passengers would mistake the community for Chicago, Illinois. 
The city&#x27;s name was changed to Chicago Junction, but the word 
``junction&#x27;&#x27; did not fit on name boards at the time. In 1917, the town 
changed its name to Willard, after the then-president of the Baltimore 
and Ohio Railroad, Daniel Willard. In 1960, Willard officially became a 
city. The city is an asset to the great State of Ohio through its many 
contributions in the fields of manufacturing and agriculture. It 
remains to this day a key junction for the rail company CSX 
Transportation.
  Mr. Speaker, by remembering the 150th Anniversary of the City of 
Willard, community members recognize the outstanding achievements, 
maintain the pioneer attitude, and strive to better their city through 
the principles on which it was founded. I thank and congratulate 
Willard on this significant milestone.

        TRIBUTE CELEBRATING THE BASKETBALL LEGACY OF LONDON, KY

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. HAROLD ROGERS

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 6, 2024

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
glowing basketball legacy in London, Kentucky, now headlined by North 
Laurel High School graduate Reed Sheppard, who was the No. 3 overall 
pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, inspiring young athletes across the 
Bluegrass State.
  Reed Sheppard, the 2023 Mr. Kentucky Basketball and McDonald&#x27;s All-
American, thrilled the Big Blue Nation, and especially Kentucky&#x27;s Fifth 
Congressional District, when he chose to follow in his parents&#x27; 
footsteps to play basketball at the University of Kentucky. His stellar 
performance for the Wildcats earned national attention and countless 
accolades, including the premiere Freshman of the Year for the National 
Association of Basketball Coaches, the U.S. Basketball Writers 
Association, the Field of 68, Dick Vitale&#x27;s ``Diaper Dandy&#x27;&#x27;, and the 
highly competitive Southeastern Conference. Reed&#x27;s shooting percentage 
was unmatched at the college level with 53.6 percent from the floor, 
52.1 percent from the 3-point range and 83.1 percent from the free-
throw line. As exciting as it was to watch him don the blue and white 
jersey, Kentuckians watched in awe as Reed topped his personal best 
performance during the NBA Summer League games against the nation&#x27;s top 
NBA recruits. He averaged 20 points, 5.3 assists and 4.8 rebounds per 
game, showcasing his skills as an offensive threat and a dominating 
defender.
  Some say it&#x27;s all in his DNA, and while the Sheppard family certainly 
has talent, it&#x27;s their hard work and determination on the court that 
has acquired the respect of other basketball legends. His father Jeff, 
who inspired Reed&#x27;s decision to wear No. 15, won the hearts of Wildcat 
fans as part of the National Championship Teams in 1996 and 1998. The 
Georgia-native star was the 1998 NCAA Tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding 
Player and went on to play in the NBA for the Atlanta Hawks and the 
Toronto Raptors, before taking his professional career overseas.
  Reed and his sister Madison, who had an impressive collegiate 
basketball career at Campbellsville University in Kentucky, were 
blessed with a double-dose of talent. Their mother, Stacey Reed 
Sheppard, a Laurel County native, set new records for the University of 
Kentucky Women&#x27;s Basketball team, becoming the all-time leader in 
steals, ranking among the top 10 in scoring and assists, and earning 
respect as one of the best players in the SEC. She was also a member of 
the USA Women&#x27;s Basketball Team, representing our Nation and our 
Commonwealth in international competition.
  While the Sheppards strive for championship banners, their pursuit of 
excellence has not been contained to the basketball court. They have 
been generous stewards of our region, donating countless hours and 
resources to give back to their beloved hometown. Stacey founded and 
operated the Laurel County Backpack Club for 16 years and served on the 
Board of Directors for Operation UNITE, while Jeff founded and led 
UNITE&#x27;s Shoot Hoops Not Drugs basketball camps for 11 years, inspiring 
thousands of students to make good choices on and off the court. After 
the catastrophic flood in Eastern Kentucky in 2022, the entire family 
made the trek to Eastern Kentucky to help cleanout and rebuild homes 
for months with their church, Faith Assembly of God, showing compassion 
that matches their seismic talent.
  The Sheppards are now icons of a Laurel County Basketball Legacy that 
spans nearly a century, starting in 1926 with a team who won the first 
state title and went on to win the Final Four National Championship. 
Since then, Laurel County high school basketball teams have earned 
eight more state basketball titles and 48 trips to the Sweet 16. The 
Laurel County Lady Cardinals legendary coach Roy Bowling was named 
Coach of the Year three times, raising the bar for competitive 
basketball to southeastern Kentucky.
  It is only fitting that the Laurel County Wellness Park now features 
the Sheppard Family Basketball Courts, along with the names of student 
athletes and coaches who pursued excellence for generations. We have 
enormous talent in the mountains, and it is a joy to see our region in 
the national spotlight as a result of such wonderful athletes and 
leaders.
