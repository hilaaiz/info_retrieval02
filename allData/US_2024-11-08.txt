    CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF THE FRIENDS UNIVERSITY SINGING QUAKERS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. RON ESTES

                               of kansas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Friends 
University Singing Quakers for a century of vocal excellence.
  The Singing Quakers have proven to be a premier choral group that has 
taken their talents across the country, including our nation&#x27;s capital, 
and even around the world. They have entertained Kansans locally with 
annual home concerts, Christmas candlelight concerts and Symphony of 
Spring.
  The many men and women who have performed with this prestigious group 
should be commended for their incredible talent, dedication to musical 
greatness, camaraderie and character. The Friends University Singing 
Quakers represent their institution and our region well.
  I also want to recognize the phenomenal leadership of the Singing 
Quakers&#x27; directors, including current director Dr. Rayvon T.J. Moore, 
recent director Dr. Mark Bartel and longtime director Dr. Cecil Riney. 
They have elevated choral music in Kansas and are well-respected far 
beyond the Sunflower State.
  As they gather this weekend to celebrate and perform, I want to thank 
the alumni and current performers of the Friends University Singing 
Quakers for providing our region with exceptional choral music for 100 
years.

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Metra 
Commuter Railroad as it celebrates its 40th anniversary.
  Whereas, for the past 40 years, Metra has dedicated itself to 
providing my constituents and other Illinoisans with reliable, 
affordable transportation options to connect them to greater 
Chicagoland;
  Whereas, on February 15, 2022, Metra approved its second strategic 
plan, My Metra, Our Future. While the name indicates a transportation 
plan, the motto My Metra also illustrates the ethos of the agency;
  Whereas, Metra is not solely a transportation provider. It is an 
essential and reliable service that is there when you need it. To get 
you and your loved ones&#x27; home, and everywhere else, safely and 
comfortably. It is about meeting its riders&#x27; expectations and 
understanding their values and priorities for the region;
  Whereas, My Metra was adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic--to ensure 
that trains kept running. Metra provided valuable services to essential 
workers in the healthcare field and other sectors who didn&#x27;t have the 
option to work from home or take leave. Metra&#x27;s own employees are part 
of this group of essential workers who proved that Metra is a source of 
continuity and connection, and a vital cog in economic and social life 
in Illinois; and
  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, THAT I ROBIN L. KELLY, SERVING AS A 
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, RECOGNIZE the public servants 
who work for Metra while it celebrates its 40th anniversary and 
continues to serve our community.

   CONGRATULATING ENVISION DALLAS ON A NEW FACILITY IN FARMERS BRANCH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETH VAN DUYNE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Envision 
Dallas on the grand opening of its new facility in Farmers Branch, 
Texas. Envision Dallas has demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to 
our community and dedicated countless hours to the development of a 
state-of-the-art facility that will serve as a beacon of hope, 
opportunity, and empowerment for many North Texans.
  The transformation of the long-abandoned AT&amp;T call center in Farmers 
Branch is nothing short of remarkable. This building, which had stood 
vacant for over a decade, has now been revitalized into a hub of 
economic growth and empowerment. The project has not only breathed new 
life into this space, but it has also created over 100 jobs for 
individuals who are blind or visually impaired, providing them with 
meaningful employment through the AbilityOne program. This level of 
investment and impact is precisely the kind of initiative that 
strengthens our communities.
  In addition to its direct contributions to economic development, 
Envision Dallas plays a critical role in supporting our national 
defense. Through its work as a key AbilityOne provider, Envision Dallas 
supplies essential items such as battle dress uniforms, office 
supplies, presentation binders, printing support, and eyeglass cases to 
our military. This commitment underscores its vital role in supporting 
those who ensure our national security every day.
  Envision Dallas also extends its impact closer to home by directly 
supporting the State of

[[Page E1122]]

Texas through its provision of essential safety gear to our road and 
highway workers through the Texas Workforce Commission and food 
products to the Texas prison system. Beyond its contributions to 
defense and state operations, Envision Dallas offers an array of 
essential services that will benefit countless families in North Texas. 
The Cathy G. Hudson Envision Child Development Center will nurture our 
youngest learners, ensuring children of all abilities have the 
foundation they need to succeed. The Perot Welcome Center will serve as 
a vital resource for families and individuals seeking support. The 
newly established Envision Vision and Rehabilitation Clinic will 
provide cutting-edge care to those with vision impairments, while the 
William L. Hudson Workforce Innovation Center will empower individuals 
who are blind or visually impaired to gain the skills and confidence 
necessary to excel in today&#x27;s workforce.
  Envision Dallas is setting a powerful example of what it means to 
truly invest in people, infrastructure, and the future of our 
community. This transformative facility will no doubt have a positive 
impact on North Texas for years to come.

 HONORING DEPUTY ADJUTANT GENERAL OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WARREN PERRY ON HIS 
                               RETIREMENT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of New Hampshire&#x27;s 
Deputy Adjutant General, Warren Perry, who is retiring later this year. 
For nine years, Warren has diligently served New Hampshire&#x27;s Department 
of Military Affairs and Veterans Services. In his role, he has played a 
key part in connecting military officials with the needs of New 
Hampshire and ensuring our veterans are receiving the support that they 
need.
  Warren served our country for 28 years in the United States Army, and 
for that we are incredibly thankful. He is a veteran of Operations 
Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom where he fought to keep the United 
States safe from foreign threats. In service to his fellow Granite 
Staters, when he returned home, Warren went on to serve as the State 
Inspector General for the New Hampshire National Guard.
  Beyond national security, Warren has tirelessly served our 
communities on a local level. As Deputy Adjutant General, Warren has 
worked to strengthen the New Hampshire Veteran-Friendly Business 
Program and increase veterans&#x27; employment with our local businesses as 
they return from combat.
  As a decorated soldier, Warren has been awarded the Legion of Merit, 
the Bronze Star Medal, and many other distinguished honors. As a 
community leader, Warren has aided our veterans in their employment 
efforts. And as a proud member of a military family, Warren knows the 
meaning of service and has always strived to give back to his 
community. Warren has dedicated his life to the security of our Nation 
and the betterment of our communities.
  On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I thank Deputy Adjutant General Warren Perry for his service 
and wish him a happy retirement. I wish Warren and his family all the 
best in the years to come.

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Texas-24 Hometown 
Hero, Southlake resident Ashley Burnett. Last year, Ashley found out 
her father, Todd, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS), a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease. Ashley has been 
working to raise awareness and funds for ALS research ever since. Over 
the summer, which marked the 10-year anniversary of the original ice 
bucket challenge to raise money for ALS research, Ashley hosted her own 
ice bucket challenge at Hawaiian Falls Waterpark in honor of her dad.
  In Ashley&#x27;s own words, ``With a disease that is full of the unknown 
and often feels so hopeless, raising money through this event gives my 
family back a little bit of that hope.&#x27;&#x27; Through her efforts, Ashley is 
helping those living with ALS, and their loved ones; tackle the 
physical, emotional, and financial toll that comes from the devastating 
disease. Her challenge raised over $15,000 for ALS research.
  I&#x27;d like to thank Ashley for her efforts to support those living with 
ALS. She is an inspiration to North Texans and a beacon of hope to 
those suffering from the disease.

 HONORING THE RECIPIENTS OF TEXAS&#x27; 26TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT VETERAN

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recall and recognize the 
recipients of a special annual salute to honor local Veterans of the 
26th Congressional District of Texas. Starting in 2005, I have had the 
privilege of honoring distinguished Veterans of my district with Texas&#x27; 
26th Congressional District Veteran Commendation.
  Our nation&#x27;s Veterans have selflessly and honorably served our 
country and preserved our freedoms. It is because of their service that 
we enjoy all the liberties we are afforded. These brave men and women 
deserve our thanks and praise.
  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to publicly recognize 
eighty-six Veterans over the past two decades and honor their service 
through the presentation of the Congressional Veteran Commendation 
(CVC) at the annual ``Salute Our Veterans&#x27;&#x27; luncheon sponsored by the 
Highland Village Business Association (HVBA) and the City of Highland 
Village, Texas.
  At this patriotic event each year, in addition to the announcement of 
the CVC recipients, each Veteran in attendance is afforded the 
opportunity to give their name and branch of service along with a 
highlight of their military service. With an annual attendance of over 
250, the HVBA graciously covers the cost of the luncheon for attending 
Veterans and their guest.
  As I retire from the U.S. House of Representatives, allow me to 
announce the five recipients of the 2024 Congressional Veteran 
Commendation and add their names to the illustrious list of prior 
recipients.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of 
David Biggs as he retires from his role as City Manager of Orinda.
  David has brought a deep understanding of urban development to his 
work as City Manager of Orinda. After earning a degree in political 
science from California State University, Fullerton, he went on to earn 
his MBA from University of California Irvine. For the last ten years of 
his career, David has served as city manager of two cities in the East 
Bay, first in Hercules starting in 2014 and later in Orinda, beginning 
in 2021. During his time as City Manager of Orinda, he has worked 
tirelessly to serve our community, from his role in making Juneteenth 
an official holiday to his work to enhance Orinda&#x27;s downtown area. 
David&#x27;s hard work has helped to increase quality of life and foster a 
vibrant community throughout the city.
  Further, David has been a leader in improving Orinda&#x27;s roads, helping 
to improve connectivity throughout the city. He was instrumental in the 
continuation of this long-term project, which began in 2012, and his 
efforts improved the city&#x27;s Pavement Condition Index (PCI) score from 
one of the lowest in the region to the second highest in the Bay Area. 
In recognition of his service, David was also awarded the 2020 Local 
Government Service Award by the International City/County Management 
Association (ICMA), an accolade he certainly earned for his years of 
dedicated service to the people of Orinda and the East Bay.
  Please join me in congratulating David Biggs on his well-deserved 
retirement after years of outstanding public service.

                HONORING VIETNAM WAR VETERAN RICH ALLEN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor Rich Allen, a distinguished 
military veteran and the longest tenured employee at Lansing Community 
College. Rich Allen&#x27;s life exemplifies dedication to both education and 
service. His story is one of unwavering commitment to his country and 
to higher education.
  Born on June 11, 1945 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Rich moved with his 
family to Michigan in the 1950s. He grew up in Michigan and graduated 
from Chelsea High School in 1963. After earning a Bachelor of Arts 
degree from Cleary University, Rich chose to enlist in the U.S. Army in 
1967 during the height of the Vietnam War. He served with the Army 
Security Agency, a predecessor of today&#x27;s National Security Agency, 
which was tasked with electronic intelligence and warfare. Agency 
operators played a critical role in intercepting and decoding enemy 
radio transmissions to provide vital intelligence to American forces.
  As a Morse Intercept Operator, Rich underwent rigorous training, 
mastering Morse code. In 1968, he was deployed to Vietnam stationed at 
the 303rd Radio Research Battalion, an undercover unit for Army 
Security Agency operators. Rich performed critical tasks such as 
tracking enemy radio transmissions and triangulating positions to 
support military operations. His work, which often included helicopter 
reconnaissance to gather frontline intelligence, was crucial to the war 
effort, coordinating intelligence that informed artillery and 
airstrikes.
  Rich&#x27;s distinguished service earned him numerous commendations, 
including the Bronze Star Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster, the Army 
Commendation Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal, all recognizing his 
technical expertise and steadfast commitment.
  After his honorable discharge in 1971, Rich returned to Michigan and 
enrolled at Lansing Community College, marking the beginning of a 50-
year career. While pursuing a degree in computer programming, he began 
as a student programmer in 1973 and soon transitioned to a full-time 
position in the Information Technology Department, where he helped 
advance the college&#x27;s technological capabilities. From writing code on 
punch cards and using early computer systems to developing the 
college&#x27;s first online system in 1975, his work laid the foundation for 
modern IT practices at Lansing Community College.
  Over his tenure spanning more than five decades, Rich Allen has 
served under seven college presidents and held various job titles, 
adapting to each new wave of technology. His expertise and 
collaborative spirit has helped countless colleagues, earning him deep 
respect within the Lansing community.
  Rich&#x27;s legacy is marked not only by his military service and 
professional accomplishments but also by his dedication to his family. 
He finds joy in spending time with his son and grandchildren, fishing, 
camping, and gardening--a testament to living a well-rounded life. It 
is with profound respect and gratitude that I recognize his service.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor historic 
Warren County, which is celebrating its bicentennial anniversary this 
fall. Warren County was incorporated in November of 1824 through an act 
of the New Jersey State Legislature, which named the new county after 
the renowned Revolutionary War hero, Dr. Joseph Warren. At the time of 
her founding, a sum of almost $10,000 was raised to build a county 
courthouse that is still in use to this day.
  Warren County has historically been an important locus of 
transportation and commerce. In the 1650s, Dutch settlers built a road 
to carry mined copper in the region across colony lines to New York. 
Today, ``Old Mine Road&#x27;&#x27; is a popular visitor attraction for both New 
Jersey residents and tourists from across the country. Through the 19th 
century, Warren County expanded in commercial importance, hosting a 
large part of the Morris Canal, which connected the New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania countryside to metropolitan markets on the eastern 
seaboard. Phillipsburg, New Jersey, also became a major hub for five 
major railroads.
  The County also has a long history of industriousness and prosperity. 
In the 1830s, furnaces in Oxford, New Jersey, became the first in the 
Nation to use the hot blast process, while a Phillipsburg furnace was 
one of the first to employ the Bessemer process. Phillipsburg was also 
home to the first commercially successful diesel-electric train 
engines. In the 20th century, a heavy manufacturing plant in 
Phillipsburg provided critical machinery for the Allied World War II 
victory. Today, Warren County remains the leading manufacturing county 
among the 21 counties of New Jersey.
  Agriculture has long been a staple of Warren County&#x27;s prosperity and 
health. Warren County feeds New Jerseyans as the top producing County 
of milk, dairy, cattle, feed corn, and eggs. The county&#x27;s proud 
tradition of family-owned farms continues to provide quality fresh 
produce to residents across New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
  It is my honor to congratulate the communities of Warren County on 
their bicentennial celebration, as it continues to be a pillar of New 
Jerseyan and American agriculture, industry, and history.

     RECOGNIZING LA PURISIMA CATHOLIC CHURCH&#x27;S 100-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize La Purisima 
Catholic Church, a pillar of our community that has served parishioners 
in the City of Orange for the last century.
  Established in 1924 on Center Street as La Purisima Mission, the 
church opened through the generous donation of Mr. Remedios Mares and 
originally served local residents and seasonal workers from Mexico. In 
October of 1957, La Purisima Mission came under the spiritual 
caretaking of the Missionary Servants of the Most Holy Trinity, who 
oversaw the mission&#x27;s growth partly due to the influx of new residents 
to the area from Orange&#x27;s burgeoning aerospace industry. This period 
also saw an expansion of services provided to local residents, 
including the first ``Fiestas&#x27;&#x27; beginning in 1958 and the parochial 
school opened by Sisters of the Company of Mary in 1964.
  In 1962, La Purisima&#x27;s ``old church&#x27;&#x27; building was constructed. It 
was in this building where La Purisima was granted Parish status on May 
8, 1964, by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. La Purisima would join the 
newly formed Diocese of Orange on June 18, 1976.
  The growth of Vietnamese and Hispanic American communities in and 
around the parish of La Purisima led to some of the first trilingual 
liturgies in the Diocese of Orange. Due to the popularity of the 
trilingual liturgies and the growth of the community at La Purisima, 
parishioners received permission in 1999 to begin efforts to build a 
larger church building that remains in use today, dedicated on June 4, 
2005, by Bishop Tod Brown.
  This year the La Purisima Catholic Church celebrates its 100th 
anniversary, a testament to its commitment to service in the community.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing La Purisima Catholic 
Church&#x27;s 100 years of service to the residents of the City of Orange, 
and in wishing them a bright future of faith and service.

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Fairfax County 
History Commission on the occasion of the 20th Annual Fairfax County 
History Conference.
  Since 1969, the Fairfax County History Commission has worked to 
identify, document, record and preserve the history of our region. 
There are few areas in the country that are as rich in history as our 
area is. The History Conference provides an opportunity to reflect on 
the accomplishments of the past year while recognizing our neighbors 
who have made significant contributions to preserving and promoting our 
local history. Through the dedicated efforts of the History Commission 
and its many volunteers, we are assured that our history will not be 
lost and will be available for future generations.
  This year, a number of dedicated individuals are being honored for 
their commitment to the preservation and education of history. I am 
proud to include in the Record their names:
  Dr. Glenn Fatzinger received the Lifetime Achievement Award for his 
career as a distinguished historian and educator.
  Tom Shoop received the Nan Netherton Award for his book, ILDA, that 
brings to life the stories and history of a small, interracial 
enterprising village in Fairfax County.
  Etta Wilson, Rita Colbelt, Linneall Naylor, and Rondia Prescott with 
Jenee Lindner received the Cultural Engagement Heritage Award for their 
book, Black Communities of Fairfax -- A History, that serves as an 
anthology of Fairfax County&#x27;s rich Black Heritage.
  Gibran Parvez received the Edith Moore Sprouse Award for the creation 
of his website, Heritage Dulles, that is an interactive online map and 
historical essay allowing readers to explore the area within and around 
Dulles Airport over multiple time periods.
  Dr. Krystyn Moon, Kristin Neun, Dr. Matt Bakker, and Janine Dewitt 
received the Beth Mitchell Award for their website, Documenting 
Exclusion &amp; Resilience, that examines the racial dynamics among 
property owners in Northern Virginia and Fairfax County.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating all 
the honorees and thanking the Fairfax County History Commission for the 
important work they do for the Northern Virginia community.

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable 
constituent from my district, Fred Powell, as he approaches his 103rd 
birthday in May 2025. With over a century of life experiences, Fred&#x27;s 
journey is one of service, dedication, and community that deserves 
recognition.
  After his honorable discharge from the Army, Fred joined the family 
business, Powell&#x27;s Electric Shop, which was founded in 1922 by his 
father and great-uncle. What began as a small appliance store on York 
Road in Hatboro grew over the decades into a full-service electrical 
company serving Bucks and Montgomery counties. Fred took the reins of 
the business in the 1950s, working alongside his father until he 
eventually purchased the business and expanded it further.
  Fred&#x27;s dedication to Powell&#x27;s Electric Shop laid the foundation for 
the company&#x27;s success, and in 1990, after nearly 40 years of 
leadership, he passed the torch to his son Doug, continuing the Powell 
family legacy into its third generation. Today, Powell&#x27;s Electric Shop 
remains a trusted family-owned business, with Doug at the helm, 
continuing to provide excellent service to the community.
  In his retirement, Fred enjoys spending time with his children and 
grandchildren. He remains an active member of his community, attending 
resident meetings and participating in social events at The Manor at 
York Town. Fred also stays connected with friends and neighbors through 
various programs and classes at the Manor.
  As we celebrate Fred Powell&#x27;s incredible life over 100 years, we 
honor his service to our country, his contributions to the success of 
his family business, and his unwavering commitment to his community. 
Fred&#x27;s legacy is one of hard work, dedication, and an enduring love for 
his family and friends. We are deeply grateful for his many 
contributions and wish him continued health and happiness in the years 
to come.

                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN GOODWIN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KEVIN MULLIN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 8, 2024

  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor John Goodwin, Councilmember 
and current Mayor of the Town of Colma, upon his retirement after 35 
years of serving the public.
  Mr. Goodwin was born in a small community near Denver, Colorado, in 
1960. His love of the outdoors and passion for serving others led him 
to begin his career as a National Park Service law enforcement ranger. 
For 27 years, Mr. Goodwin worked in National Parks across the 
continental United States, traveling from the Rocky Mountains in 
Colorado, to Mount Rainier in Washington State, to the Everglades in 
Florida, and finally to Golden Gate National Recreation Area in the San 
Francisco Bay Area.
  Mr. Goodwin&#x27;s extensive career as a National Park Service ranger is 
emblematic of his commitment to helping others. He put his life on the 
line numerous times, saving many others in the process as well as 
nearly losing his own from two devastating lightning strikes. Mr. 
Goodwin endured the physical and mental costs of the dangers of his 
career, including a decade-long battle with post-traumatic stress 
disorder. However, with the help of his family and friends, Mr. Goodwin 
persevered, seeking treatment at the West Coast Post Trauma Retreat and 
continuing his mission to help others. He later documented many of his 
unforgettable stories in his memoir ``Echoes of the Badge: Stories from 
a National Park Service Career&#x27;&#x27; where he poignantly shared the joys 
and tribulations of his 27 years as a ranger.
  In 2016, after retiring from the National Park Service, Mr. Goodwin 
decided to continue his career of public service by successfully 
running for an elected seat on Town of Colma City Council. Referred to 
as the ``City of Souls,&#x27;&#x27; this small community just south of San 
Francisco is unique in that much of its land is dominated by 
cemeteries--the population of the dead is speculated to outnumber the 
living by a ratio of one thousand to one. During his tenure as a 
councilmember, Mr. Goodwin embarked on numerous initiatives to 
cultivate the vitality of the town. He pushed for increased multi-
cultural recreation events, supported public art projects, championed 
flag-raisings to honor the diversity of the town&#x27;s residents, and 
offered his unwavering support for local businesses. He additionally 
welcomed Colma&#x27;s Veteran&#x27;s Village with open arms, providing 65 units 
of housing for formerly homeless veterans and their families. Mr. 
Goodwin served as Mayor of Colma in 2020, where he worked tirelessly to 
protect his constituents and the town&#x27;s local businesses during the 
height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, he again took office as 
Mayor, serving the town on the 100th anniversary of the town&#x27;s 
incorporation.
  Mr. Goodwin has also demonstrated exemplary community service outside 
of his official leadership positions in Colma. He has volunteered and 
raised thousands of dollars for various mental illness and veteran 
support organizations, including the Wounded Warrior Project, the 
National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention, and for 9/11 survivors.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring the extraordinary service to the public that John Goodwin has 
presented over his 35-year career. All of the lives that he has touched 
are better off through his dedication and commitment.
