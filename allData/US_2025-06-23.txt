                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize and honor Culver 
Police Chief Wayne Bean for more than four decades of dedicated service 
to the Town of Culver and the broader law enforcement community as he 
enters retirement.
  Chief Bean, a lifelong resident of Culver and Union Township, 
graduated from Culver Community Schools and began his law enforcement 
career as a reserve deputy marshal in 1980 for the Culver Police 
Department, becoming a full-time deputy in 1982. His leadership quickly 
stood out as he was promoted to deputy chief in 1991 and chief of the 
Culver Police Department just a few years later, a role he has held 
with distinction for more than two decades.
  Throughout his career, Chief Bean has served with professionalism, 
bravery, and compassion. He supported law enforcement efforts beyond 
Culver, including service as a reserve officer with the Argos Police 
Department in the 1990&#x27;s and again from 2007 to 2012.
  Chief Bean has been involved in numerous complex and critical 
investigations. In one particularly heroic incident, he assisted in 
defusing a dangerous standoff, disarming an armed individual who was 
threatening family members, thereby preventing serious harm or loss of 
life.
  Chief Bean also championed traffic safety and enforcement, recording 
over 60 DUI arrests in a single year, and worked tirelessly to 
modernize the department&#x27;s equipment and operations to better serve the 
community.
  Beyond his law enforcement duties, Chief Bean has remained active in 
civic life. He is a long-standing member of the local Fraternal Order 
of Police, having served as president and currently serving as vice 
president.
  Mr. Speaker, Chief Wayne Bean&#x27;s legacy is one of steadfast 
dedication, courage, and unwavering commitment to public safety. As he 
retires, I join the residents of Culver and law enforcement 
professionals across the Hoosier state in thanking him for his 
outstanding service and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
Altoona native, Penn State graduate, and newest Captain of D.C. Fire 
and EMS, Jordan Wiley. Jordan studied Emergency Medicine at the 
University of Pittsburgh before receiving his Master of Public 
Administration from Penn State University.
  In October of 2014, Jordan joined the D.C. Fire and EMS Department as 
a Firefighter and Paramedic. In nearly eleven years of service, Jordan 
was awarded the department&#x27;s `Paramedic of the Year&#x27; award in 2019 and 
earned promotions to Sergeant in 2020, Lieutenant in 2022, and Captain 
in 2024. However, the most important milestone for Jordan was when he 
met his wife Catelyn and started a family with their two children, 
Russell and Madison.
  Jordan has dedicated so much of his time, in and out of the 
firehouse, to serving his fellow community members. As a cancer 
survivor himself, Jordan is instrumental in efforts to promote cancer 
awareness and prevention within the department. Cancer-related deaths 
are rising among firefighters, and Jordan&#x27;s advocacy will help save 
lives.
  Jordan is also an advocate for the National Marrow Donor Program, 
working to save lives by connecting bone marrow donors with patients 
who have life-threatening blood disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, 
and sickle cell.
  Jordan has faithfully served his community and fellow Americans for 
more than a decade, both as a paramedic and as an advocate for cancer 
patients, and I know his parents, Frank Wiley and Dr. Mary O&#x27;Leary 
Wiley, are incredibly proud of the man and father he has become.
  Along with everyone in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th Congressional District, I 
want to congratulate Captain Wiley on his selection to lead the D.C. 
Fire and EMS Department and thank him for his continued dedication to 
our fellow Americans.

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Didi Krishna 
Kumari, a revered spiritual leader, humanitarian, and educator whose 
lifelong commitment to service has uplifted communities across the 
globe.
  Born on May 9, 1961, Didi Krishna began her spiritual journey at the 
age of three under the guidance of saints Sadhu T.L. Vaswani and Dada 
J.P. Vaswani. She now serves as the head of the Sadhu Vaswani Mission, 
leading with humility, wisdom, and dedication to service.
  Founded in the 1930&#x27;s, the Sadhu Vaswani Mission has flourished under 
Didi Krishna&#x27;s leadership into a global force for compassion and 
healing. With more than 60 centers across five continents, the Mission 
carries out extensive work in education, health care, spiritual 
development, and humanitarian relief. For over ninety years, it has 
served those most in

[[Page E605]]

need--uplifting the poor, the sick, the voiceless, and the forgotten.
  To many, Didi Krishna is more than a leader; she is a spiritual guide 
and a saint-like presence. Her gentle demeanor, deep compassion, and 
unwavering devotion have earned her the love and respect of people from 
all walks of life. She leads not with fanfare, but with quiet strength 
and grace, always placing service before self.
  Mr. Speaker, Didi Krishna Kumari&#x27;s tireless efforts are a testament 
to the profound impact one individual can have through a life of 
purpose and humility. It is my honor to recognize her extraordinary 
contributions to humanity.

HONORING RICHARD STEIN&#x27;S CONTRIBUTIONS TO ORANGE COUNTY&#x27;S ARTS AND ARTS 
                               EDUCATION

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions 
of Richard Stein, a leading advocate and partner for the arts and arts 
education across Orange County, California.
  Richard, who recently stepped down as the President and CEO of Arts 
Orange County, led the organization for more than 14 years. Under his 
leadership, Arts Orange County addressed the needs of the arts and 
culture community in Orange County as a trailblazer among nonprofit 
arts councils worldwide--augmenting traditional arts agency programs 
and services with its unique role as the community&#x27;s go-to arts 
consultant to government, education, and nonprofit organizations. This 
has helped enable Arts Orange County, which is celebrating its 30th 
anniversary, to become a leading advocate for the arts and arts 
education on the local, state, and national level. Richard&#x27;s 
stewardship also led Arts Orange County to become a strong supporter of 
the Congressional Arts Competition, providing funds for winning artists 
to travel to Washington, D.C. to see their artwork displayed in the 
U.S. Capitol.
  Prior to his appointment at Arts Orange County in August 2008, Rick 
transformed the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach into a major resident 
professional theatre over the course of more than 17 years as its 
Executive Director, growing its annual budget of $700,000 to $7 million 
and producing more than 100 plays, including two national touring 
productions. He also directed many notable productions at this venue, 
including several premieres.
  Rick first came to Orange County in 1987, to serve as Managing 
Director of the Grove Shakespeare Festival in Garden Grove following a 
five-year stint as Director of Lincoln Theater at Connecticut&#x27;s 
University of Hartford. Before that, he held management positions with 
two major symphony orchestras.
  Rick holds degrees in English from Columbia and Syracuse Universities 
and returned to Columbia for postgraduate study in drama on a National 
Endowment for the Humanities summer fellowship. He was sent to Korea on 
a cultural exchange by the International Theatre Institute-US, served 
on the executive committee of the League of Resident Theatres, and was 
a contributing writer to AMERICAN THEATRE magazine.
  Rick is a former Chair of the John Wayne Airport Arts Commission, 
past President of the Association of Fund Raising Professionals-Orange 
County Chapter, and twice former Co-Chair of National Philanthropy Day-
Orange County. From 2009 to 2022, he served on the board of 
Californians for the Arts/California Arts Advocates, a statewide 
organization promoting the interests of the arts community, including 
three years as its President.
  Demonstrating his commitment to fostering an appreciation of the arts 
in the next generation, Richard has been a guest lecturer at University 
of California, Irvine and California State University, Fullerton, and 
was a commencement keynote speaker for the Laguna College of Art and 
Design. He has served as a panelist or site visitor for the National 
Endowment for the Arts, California Arts Council, Western States Arts 
Federation, Los Angeles County Arts Commission, City of Los Angeles 
Department of Cultural Affairs, City of San Diego Commission for Arts 
and Culture, Riverside Arts Council, New England Foundation for the 
Arts, Louisville Fund for the Arts, City of Pasadena, and the 
Connecticut Commission on the Arts, for which he also produced its 
State Arts Awards.
  Although his career has largely been in the theatre, Rick&#x27;s first 
post after finishing graduate school was as Executive Director of a 
local arts agency, Oswego County Council on the Arts, located in 
Fulton, New York. In fact, the theatre company Richard co-founded in 
1977, Contemporary Theatre of Syracuse, continues operation today as 
The Red House, a highly successful producer of multi-disciplinary arts. 
He is a 33-year resident of San Juan Capistrano with his wife, Alison, 
an artist.
  I call on my colleagues to join me in celebrating Richard Stein&#x27;s 
leadership and stewardship of the arts in Orange County and thank him 
for helping bring arts and culture to our community and country.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JAMES C. MOYLAN

                                of guam

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Mr. MOYLAN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure to honor the life 
of Ms. Alfonsina Diaz--a World War II survivor; lifelong educator; a 
woman of God; mother, grandmother, and great grandmother to her family 
and community; and most importantly, her legacy of 100 years of life 
that demonstrate the values of spiritual strength and the significance 
of family.
  Known to her family and friends as Ancin, she is the eldest of six 
children born to Maria Santos Tanaka Diaz and Joaquin Flores Diaz. 
Despite her childhood and much of her youth remembering the painful 
occupation of the Japanese during World War II, she intentionally lives 
and chooses to carry her life with the spirit of resilience and joy. A 
fond memory of her youth includes working alongside her sister Cecilia 
Tanaka Diaz Reyes, first cousin Matilde Cruz Baron, and aunt Asuncion 
Tanaka Santos at Tommy&#x27;s Soda Fountain. Owned by her uncle Tom Santos 
Tanaka, Sr. and father Joaquin Flores Diaz, it was a popular spot for 
the teenagers during the 1950&#x27;s. She always had fun when she worked.
  After graduating from high school, she worked at C.L. (previously 
Sinajana) Elementary as an elementary school teacher for the 1st to 3rd 
grades. She met her husband and they&#x27;ve stayed together since marrying 
in June of 1950. When they moved to Agana Heights, they&#x27;ve welcomed 
their seven children: Carmelita, Robert, Marie, Joaquin, Martha, 
Daniel, and Nora. As she raised her family, she continued to be a full-
time teacher.
  The love she had for her job can be felt through her previous and 
present students--

[[Page E606]]

many of which have shared fond memories during their time together. 
About 10 years ago, a former student accidentally bumped into Ancin and 
asked for a picture. He intended to share it with his friends in Los 
Angeles who all went to the same elementary school. Another student, 
who is now a proud retired registered nurse, shared her experiences 
with Ancin. She shares that when she was in 3rd grade, Ancin had a 
patient and nurturing demeanor that made learning fun and easy. She was 
also the pioneer for many of these students ``firsts&#x27;&#x27;--first person to 
introduce students to the Scholastic Book Club, fostering the love of 
reading classics; first person to take them on a field trip to Fena 
Dam/Lake; etc.
  Another fond memory a student shared was the performance during the 
Christmas Pageant, where everyone dressed as angels with tinsel halos 
and wings and sang to their hearts content. She was also noted to have 
the best dresses.
  Moreso, she was best remembered in awe for her strength and passion 
of raising a family of seven while being a full-time educator in an era 
where it was considered progressive at the time.
  Her influence reached beyond her students started many of the 
traditions that her family has come to love. Her daughter recalls one 
specific tradition of setting up and reciting the Nobena Nino every 
year on the front porch. The Nativity they used was given to Ancin by 
her mom and is now with her grandniece Norene Reyes Aldridge. Her 
children and her grandchildren credit Ancin for their love of dancing 
and for the recipe for the best homemade flour titiyas served during 
large celebrations.
  Although she was the oldest, only she and her youngest sibling Maria 
Tanaka Diaz Nauta remain. She has survived all three of her sons yet 
remains loving and faithful. Her eyes and smile speak genuinely when 
she bids goodbye with a ``Thank you, God bless you.&#x27;&#x27;
  Ancin attributes her longevity to two things: physical activity, and 
interaction with others, especially with the youth. Two wonderful 
lessons I think we can all take away from such a life well-lived 
centered on family and intentionally finding gratitude in every day.

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I seek to recognize the English Empowerment 
Center (EEC) in Falls Church, Virginia and to congratulate the 
volunteers, instructors, students, community partners, and many others 
who will be recognized at the 63rd EEC Recognition Ceremony.
  The mission of the English Empowerment Center is to teach adults the 
basic skills of reading, writing, speaking, and understanding English 
so they can access employment and education opportunities and more 
fully and equitably participate in the community.
  EEC provides the crucial first steps of language and literacy 
proficiency for workplace, citizenship, and community integration to 
help adults make measurable improvements in their lives. Last year, 
they served more than 2,000 adult learners, with the help of over 500 
volunteers who gave 24,000 plus hours of service.
  Each year the EEC recognizes students and members of the community 
who have contributed their time, energy, and resources to achieving the 
organization&#x27;s mission.

  Education continues to be one of life&#x27;s most essential tools and as 
we&#x27;ve seen in our own community, literacy is the foundation for 
unlocking education, career paths, and personal growth at any age. As a 
lifelong learner and a current student at George Mason University, I 
know firsthand the power of education. I am deeply grateful to the 
Center and it&#x27;s remarkable, participants, volunteers, and staff for 
championing literacy as a lifelong and life-changing skill.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the English Empowerment 
Center and congratulating each of the honorees of the 63rd EEC 
Recognition Ceremony.
  I wish all of them great success in their future endeavors.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ZONING COMMISSION HOME RULE 
                                  ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia 
Zoning Commission Home Rule Act. This bill would give the District of 
Columbia the authority to appoint all members of the D.C. Zoning 
Commission (Commission). Currently, the membership of the Commission 
consists of two federal officials the (the Architect of the Capitol 
(AOC) and the Director of the National Park Service (NPS)) and three 
members appointed by the D.C. mayor, subject to D.C. Council approval. 
Federal officials are members of the Commission even though the 
Commission has no authority over federal property.
  Land use is a quintessential local matter. Despite the D.C. Home Rule 
Act, which gave D.C. authority over local matters, 40 percent of the 
members of the Commission are federal officials, who are not 
accountable to the more than 700,000 D.C. residents. The federal 
government would lose nothing under this bill because the federal 
government&#x27;s land-use interests in the Nation&#x27;s capital are protected 
by federal law and federal agencies.
  The Commission creates the zoning maps and regulations, which must 
``not be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan for the national 
capital.&#x27;&#x27; The mayor is responsible for the local elements of the 
comprehensive plan, subject to Council approval. The National Capital 
Planning Commission (NCPC), which is the central planning agency for 
the federal government in D.C. and approves federal projects in D.C., 
is responsible for the federal elements of the comprehensive plan. This 
bill would not alter the comprehensive plan process or the authority of 
NCPC and the Commission.
  This bill would immediately remove the AOC and the NPS Director from 
the Commission, and the Commission would, at least initially, consist 
solely of three mayoral appointees. D.C. would have the authority to 
reconstitute the membership of the Commission through local 
legislation.
  This bill is an important step to increase D.C. home rule. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 23, 2025

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents on the One Big 
Beautiful Bill Act, post office disruptions, National Police Week, and 
Helene recovery.

       Dear Friend,
       Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 
     1--better known as the ``One Big Beautiful Bill&#x27;&#x27;--a historic 
     piece of legislation that will:
       Keep taxes low for working Americans.
       Strengthen border security.
       Rebuild our military.
       Drive American energy independence.
       Protect entitlement programs so the Americans who need them 
     have them.
       This bill is key to fulfilling the America First agenda. 
     Below, you will find some of the most important components of 
     the One Big Beautiful Bill that will make a difference in our 
     mountain communities.
       Providing tax relief for workers and families
       Provides a $5,000 tax cut for the average American family.
       Eliminates taxes on tips, overtime, and car loan interest 
     for cars made in the U.S.
       $4,000 tax deduction for seniors.
       Increases the child tax credit to $2,500 per American 
     family through 2028.
       Making tax dollars work for the American people
       Strengthens Medicaid by preventing illegal aliens and folks 
     who can, but refuse to, work from unlawfully collecting 
     benefits.
       Roots out waste, fraud, and abuse from Medicaid by removing 
     deceased individuals from the program.
       Reverses the Biden-era mandate that allowed Medicaid to 
     cover ``gender transition&#x27;&#x27; procedures for minors.
       Reversing green energy radicalism
       Eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New 
     Deal tax credits.
       Repeals the Biden administration&#x27;s electric vehicle 
     mandates.
       Drives American energy independence by opening federal 
     lands and waters to oil, gas, coal, geothermal, and mineral 
     leasing.
       Streamlines onerous permitting processes so America can 
     build again.
       Refills the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, reducing our 
     reliance on foreign oil and strengthening our national 
     security.
       Securing our borders
       Authorizes $46 billion to complete construction of the 
     border wall.
       Hires 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
     personnel, 5,000 new Customs officers, and 3,000 new Border 
     Patrol agents with the goal of deporting at least 1 million 
     illegal immigrants every year.
       Bolsters the Department of Homeland Security efforts to 
     secure our borders.
       Ensuring the U.S. military remains the strongest fighting 
     force in the world
       Ensures critical investments to rebuild our military, 
     improve quality of life for service members, bolster 
     munitions production, and modernize our nuclear arsenal.
       Launches President Trump&#x27;s Golden Dome initiative to ensure 
     the homeland is protected from modern and advanced threats.
       This bill will restore American greatness and improve the 
     lives of Americans nationwide--from the mountains of Western 
     North Caro]ina to the coastlines of California.
       The American people are ready for our Golden Age. Now, it&#x27;s 
     time for the Senate to act.
       With my warmest regards,
                                                    Chuck Edwards,
     Member of Congress.
