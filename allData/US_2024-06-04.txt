I rise today to extend my 
warmest congratulations to SAGE Eldercare on its 70th Anniversary.
  I am truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with 
you all. Over the past 70 years, SAGE Eldercare has made a deep impact 
on the lives of older adults in our community. Through delivering 
meals, restoring family heirlooms, providing companionship, and much 
more volunteers provide the support for older adults to live the most 
independent and active lives possible. I am proud to have such 
dedicated volunteers and organizations committed to helping people in 
our community within the 7th Congressional District.
  I look forward to watching them all flourish in the coming decades. I 
wish SAGE Eldercare a wonderful anniversary. May their next 70 years be 
filled with as much success as this one.
I rise today to honor a 
pillar of the community, Greater Hinds Street Missionary Baptist 
Church. Greater Hinds Street Missionary Baptist Church has served as a 
catalyst for the African-American growth in Washington County and the 
State of Mississippi.
  The history and purpose of the Greater Hinds Street Missionary 
Baptist Church is to participate and promote the Kingdom of God through 
Jesus Christ in evangelism, discipleship, Christian education, 
missions, ministries, social service, and any other objective that the 
church may consider to be appropriate and desirable.
  The Greater Hinds Street Missionary Baptist Church was established in 
1911 when a group of members chose to leave First Baptist Church, 
located in Greenville, Mississippi, and start anew. Namely, Deacon John 
Gray, Deacon John Collins, Deacon Robert Moore, and his wife, Sister 
C.L. Bean, who were all members of Penthian Hall, begin to hold church 
meetings in the associations building, located on Cately and Nelson 
Streets. They eventually moved to 502 Nelson Street, currently known as 
Does Eat Place. In January 1926, ``Hinds Street was founded at its 
present site under the late Rev. Lynke Williams.
  In 1954, Hinds Street underwent a new look with new restorations and 
1955 became a new dawning for the Church. A new pastor was elected, 
Rev. E.D. Simpson, and a massive renovation took place. The renovation 
led to a desire to rename the church. Henceforth, it became known as 
the Greater Hinds Street Missionary Baptist Church.
  In 1994, the Church committed to continuous improvement of the 
building. As improvements were made, the church also elected Youth 
Pastor, Rev. Cedric Reed. Sadly, the year brought the end of era. Rev. 
E.D. Simpson passed away in October 1994, thus bringing an end to the 
longest tenured Pastorate of the church,
  In March 1995, Rev. Thomas Morris, Sr. became the Pastor. Then, Mr. 
Frank Seid and married couple, Napolean and Maurice Thomas, donated 
property to the church for expansion. Throughout the years, the Church 
purchased several portions of land in the surrounding neighborhood. In 
October, the Hinds Street Baptist Church Community Development 
Corporation was established.
  In 1997, the church acquired additional property at 434 Hinds Street. 
In 1999, Mr. George Lynch generously donated property at the corner of 
Hinds and Alexander Streets to the church.
  In March 2002, the church broke ground for the Greater Hinds Street 
Church Family Life Center.
  In the fall of 2012, the church purchased a small 4-unit apartment 
complex and a vacant lot across the street, aiming to renew the 
building for future use and benefit to the church and community. A 
community garden has since been established on the vacant lot.
  In 2013, renovations began to update both the Church and the Family 
Life Center. This effort, aimed at reinforcing the unity of the church 
and its facilities, supported spiritual growth and community service.
  Countless individuals have been baptized and converted to Jesus 
Christ for the forgiveness and remission of sin. The churchs history 
is storied with decades long service and contributions by numerous 
members and friends, who are God-fearing and God-loving, both named and 
unnamed.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Greater 
Hinds Street Missionary Baptist Church for its rich heritage and 
dedication to serving others and giving back to the community.
I rise today to honor a 
remarkable servant, JarKevious R. Edwards.

I rise today to honor the 
dedicated efforts of JW Cleaning &amp; Maintenance, owned, and operated by 
Jimmy Williams. A true entrepreneur, an enthusiastic and self-motivated 
business owner from Cleveland, Mississippi.

  Jimmy Williams started JW Cleaning &amp; Maintenance 20 years ago. The 
idea of this business on the side developed while working at Baxter 
Healthcare, where he retired after 31 years. He was also co-owner and 
operator of County Platter restaurant. After retirement he focused his 
attention on other ventures, including the cleaning service. He 
specializes in cleaning and maintaining the upkeep of several medical 
offices, banks, and businesses in the area. He does both commercial and 
residential maintenance and cleaning.
He has a staff of five as well as others 
when needed. His daughter, Sheila Williams, also works for the 
business. She handles the books, paperwork, and the business side of 
the company. Mr. Williams states, ``were thorough and efficient, we do 
a good job, and we take pride in our work. I check on my staff daily 
and often go into the offices we clean the mornings before their staff 
arrives to make sure everything was done properly if I didnt do the 
work myself. His slogan, ``Doing whatever needs to be done, wherever 
it is needed. This is how his business has remained successful.
  He is motivated to make positive impacts on his community by helping 
people in the community. He loves to cook and take meals to the elderly 
people in the area as a part of simply giving back to his hometown of 
Cleveland. This also keeps him active and gives him an opportunity to 
stay connected with the community.

Williams for his dedication and initiative in continuing to offer his 
services to the community, surrounding areas and the MS Delta. His 
collective contributions are truly inspiring and reflect the best of 
our shared values as citizens and neighbors.
I rise today to honor the 
exemplary service and dedication of an outstanding individual from 
Yazoo City, Mississippi, Joseph Thomas, Jr. This individual has made 
significant contributions to the betterment of the Yazoo County 
community, and it is fitting that we recognize his achievements.
  Joseph Thomas, Jr., a native of Yazoo City, has recently been elected 
to the Board of Supervisors. This is a testament to his commitment to

Thomas, Jr. for his outstanding achievements and unwavering commitment

and gratitude.
I rise today to honor the 
oldest Black-owned bookstore in the Nation, Marshalls Music and Book 
Store.
  Jackson, Mississippi, is home to the oldest Black-owned bookstore in 
North America. Marshalls Music and Book Store in the heart of downtown 
Jackson is a family business that opened in 1938.
  The quaint store on the almost empty Farish Street has shelves 
stacked high with books, music, and everything in between. The walls 
are also plastered with photos of unsung African American heroes with 
roots in Mississippi.
  Pastor Louis Wilcher of the Greater Pearlie Grove Missionary Baptist 
Church first opened the store 85 years ago on the corner of Farish and 
Oakley streets. Now, Primm is the third-generation owner of the store. 
She believes in teaching people about the past, saying that Black 
history didnt begin with slavery.
  Her newfound hope now lies in opening a school. Primm believes that 
the way to stop the surge of violent youth crime is to teach children 
about hope.
, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Marshalls 
Music and Book Store for its longevity and dedication to serving the 
community.
I rise today to recognize Oscar Trevino as 
he retires as Mayor of the City of North Richland Hills. In doing so, 
he concludes a total of 25 years of dedicated public service as a 
member of the NRH Council, 22 years of which he led the City as Mayor. 
He steps down as the longest-serving Mayor in the history of North 
Richland Hills.
  Privately, Mr. Trevino was the owner of O. Trevino Construction, 
having graduated from Texas A&amp;M University with a Bachelor of Science 
in Civil Engineering in 1979. Mr. Trevino was first elected to the NRH 
City Council in May, 1999, and resigned during his second term after 
being elected Mayor in June 2002. During this time he not only served 
as a City official and business owner, but also engaged actively with a 
number of Local, State and National organizations. These included 
active board leadership positions with the National League of Cities; 
the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials 
(NALEO); the Tarrant Regional Transportation Council (TRTC); Tarrant 
County Mayors Council; the Regional Transportation Council (RTC); 
Partners in Mobility; North Central Texas Council of Governments 
(NCTCOG); the Coalition for Better Transportation; Regional Transit 
Initiative Committee; Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) Advisory 
Council; North Texas Commission; TEX-21 Committee; North Texas Super 
Bowl XLV Host Committee Council of Mayors; Birdville ISD Foundation of 
Education; Medical City North Hills Board; Northeast Leadership Forum; 
and the Northeast Tarrant Chamber of Commerce, to name but only a few.
  Utilizing his considerable organizational and public skills as Mayor, 
residents of not only North Richland Hills, but from across the North 
Texas region as well, benefitted greatly from his educational 
background and the experience and connections he earned as a successful 
heavy-highway contractor. Awards including the NCTCOG William J. 
Pitstick Regional Excellence Award, the FWHCC Businessman of the Year 
and John V. McMillan Hall of Fame Award, and the Excalibur Award from 
the NE Tarrant Chamber are a sampling of the acknowledgement he 
received from his peers for his well-regarded impact.
  As the 3rd largest municipality in Tarrant County, North Richland 
Hills grew from 55,000 to over 70,000 during Mayor Trevinos terms in 
office. Supporting this growth, Mayor Trevino worked to ensure adequate 
infrastructure, including over $100 million on the citys streets. He 
also sought to build strong regional partnerships to increase mobility 
through highway improvements and the addition of TEXRail as legacies to 
benefit the community for generations.
  Leading the Council and staff as stewards of public funds, Mayor 
Trevino sought to invest in high-quality services, with a sensitivity 
of the tax burden for senior citizens and homeowners. Investments in 
parks, equipment and staff were made to ensure the needs of the Citys 
expanding population were met. Significant updates to aging facilities 
accomplished during his tenure included a new City Hall as well as new 
fire and police stations, expanding and equipping the Citys 
professional responders with the best training and tools available to 
ensure safety and security remained a hallmark in support of NRHs 
quality of life. Additionally, a modern library, recreation center, 
animal shelter and senior center were also completed, along with 
improvements to Iron Horse Golf Course and NRH20 Family Water Park. 
These facilities provided citizens with community amenities that have 
allowed the City to provide unique recreation programs and host 
numerous annual special events. As investments, they also supported NRH 
with an identity as a desired destination location to support the 
Nations second Peppa Pig Theme Park.

  These improvements also supported economic efforts within the City to 
reduce the retail vacancy rate to 6.3 percent, the lowest since his 
early days on council. This was a significant accomplishment in spite 
of significant challenges including the pandemic and recessions. The 
achievement was accomplished by focusing not only on the newly 
developed neighborhoods, but also including the Citys historic areas 
to redevelop park areas and infrastructure to keep the areas vibrant. 
The economic vitality is evidenced with the additions of Babes, 
Sweetie Pies, Patriotic Pig, Floor &amp; Decor, Winco, Platinum Music 
Complex, Painted Tree, Gritr Sports, Seconds &amp; Surplus, Warespace, 
Truby Hilton Hotel and the development of Volli Entertainment. These 
private investments only foreshadow the potential of the former mall 
property redevelopment as new businesses and a Homewood Suites by 
Hilton are developed around the Citys new City Hall.
  As the Mayor steps down from his duties, I am proud of all he has 
accomplished for his beloved City and for the region that has been 
blessed with his public leadership and service. I have appreciated his 
wisdom and insight on many occasions and I will personally miss his 
counsel and friendship. However, I also understand the sacrifice public 
service requires of family. I wish Mayor Trevino a long retirement with 
his wife Carol, his children and his granddaughter Reis, to make-up for 
the time lost as he served. The City, our region and our State are all 
better as a result of his service.
I rise to recognize the life 
of Perry Markel Whittington, a cherished husband, father, and 
grandfather who passed away peacefully on May 3, 2024, at the age of 74 
Born on August 17, 1949, in Braxton, Mississippi, to Charles Hansford

Mark, were the youngest in a family of ten children.
  Markel graduated from Harrisville High School in 1967 and went on to 
receive a degree in business administration from Mississippi College in 
1971. He began his professional career at McRaes department store in 
1969, eventually rising to the position of Store Manager. It was here 
that he met Elizabeth ``Libby Owens, who would become his wife. The 
couple married in the summer of 1974 in Pensacola, FL, and later 
settled in Tupelo, MS. In 1979, Markel left McRaes to purchase and 
manage Middleton Office Products.
  Tupelo was where Markel and Libby chose to raise their family, 
becoming active members of the First United Methodist Church and 
forging lasting friendships Markel also contributed to the community as

the Silver Beaver Award. A committed Rotarian since 1979, he was 
honored as a Paul Harris Fellow by Rotary International. Markel also 
dedicated many years to public service as a City Councilman for Ward 1, 
serving from 2009 to 2021.
  Above all, Markel was devoted to his family. He cherished his role as 
a husband, father, and grandfather, finding great joy in lifes simple 
moments with his grandchildren. Markel was preceded in death by his 
wife Libby, his parents, his siblings Joy, Carolyn, and Bill, and his 
sisters-in-law Betty, Sally, and Opal Whittington.

(Brittney), grandchildren Stanley Pierce, Catherine Elizabeth, 
Charlotte Elliott, and Francis ``Frankie Rhodes, brothers Charlie, 
Ken, Floyd, Bill, Keith, Mark, his favorite cousin Elton, and his 
beloved dog, Magnolia Blue ``Maggie.
I rise today to honor the memory and 
legacy of Mr. John Joseph Williams, a brave and dedicated soldier who 
served our Nation with distinction during World War II as a member of 
the Ghost Army special unit.
  John was assigned to the Signal Company Special of the Ghost Army, a 
top-secret unit tasked with deceiving the enemy through elaborate 
tactical deceptions. He was among the select few who landed on Omaha 
Beach on D-Day, playing a crucial role in the Allied invasion of 
Normandy. The contributions of John Williams and his fellow Ghost Army 
soldiers were kept classified until 1996. Historians credit their unit 
of 1,100 men with saving an estimated 30,000 U.S. troops, and their 
work had a significant impact on the outcome of the war.
  After the war, John returned to Missouri, where he and his wife, 
Barbara, raised a family and started a successful career at the 
University of Missouri. He remained dedicated to his community and 
country until his passing on January 19, 2010, leaving a legacy of 
courage, sacrifice, and service.
, I am thankful for the opportunity to commemorate the 
life and service of John Joseph Williams.
I was unable to cast my vote on H. Res. 
1215. Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 233.
I rise today to celebrate the 
life of Victor John Labat, born in New Orleans, Louisiana to parents 
Victor and Jeanne Victor Labat, on November 24, 1932. At the tender age

I rise today to celebrate an 
outstanding gentleman and blessing to the City of New Orleans, Sgt. 
Stephen Burdick ``Steve Hand. He was born in Bronxville, New York on 
July 21, 1941, to Faith Seiple Hand and Edward Sayer Hand, Sr, and grew 
up in Scarsdale, New York. Mr. Hand was deeply committed to our beloved 
city. He served as a leader in the initiative to preserve and restore 
New Orleans through his work at the Vieux Carre Commission, and the 
French Market Corp during the 1980s and 1990s. After living a full life 
dedicated to serving others, Steve (82 years old) passed away on 
January 8, 2024.
  Steve was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1963. His training took place 
in Fort Benning, Georgia, with the 17th Artillery 2nd Infantry Division 
under Battery C 7th Battalion (``Garry Owen). He served one tour of 
duty in 1965 to Vietnam in which he was stationed at An Khe with the 
3rd Brigade 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Mr. Hand earned the title 
of Sergeant before being honorably discharged from the Army.
  Upon returning to the United States, Steve returned to his studies 
and ultimately graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine with 
a bachelors degree in economics. After graduating, Steve began his 
career, working in Communications and Public Service. He fondly 
reflected on his experience working on Capitol Hill as a Legislative 
Assistant and Press Secretary to Senators Winston L. Prouty of Vermont 
and Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, the first popularly elected Black 
senator. He went on to earn a masters degree in Landscape Architecture 
at LSU in 1982, where he developed an appreciation for the state of 
Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. At LSU, he wrote his thesis, about the 
historical, cultural, and political influences that have contributed to 
the development of the gardens and courtyards within the French 
Quarter. This thesis was instrumental in his future experiences in New 
Orleans, where he was dedicated to preserving, enriching, and educating 
others about the local landscaping and architecture that makes our city 
so special.
  As a hardworking and dedicated Director of the Vieux Carre 
Commission, Steve used his expertise in the French Quarters 
architectural landscape to preserve the historical and cultural 
character of New Orleanss oldest neighborhoods. Among his many 
accomplishments in this role, Steve was able to have the golden 
equestrian statue of Joan of Arc, relocated at Place de France. 
Additionally, he worked tirelessly alongside the City Council and 
Mayors office to ensure that the integrity of this neighborhood and 
the needs of its residents were protected, pioneering an effort to keep 
the French Quarter safe and clean. Mr. Hand also served the New Orleans 
community as the Executive Director of the French Market Corp. in 1994, 
through which he supported the effort to revitalize and renovate the 
French Market, leading this historical landmark to flourish in our 
citys economy.
  Steve Hands legacy will continue to live on through the spirit of 
this city, which he loved so dearly. It will live on through all of the 
people, the long-lasting friendships that he made and cultivated, and 
those whose lives he touched around the Nation. Most importantly, Steve 
Hands legacy will live on through his dear, loving family: Bear, his 
goldendoodle; his brother Edward S. Hand and sister-in-law Susan O. 
Hand; three nieces Samantha Fratus, Lindsley Rice, and Bailey Jeffrey 
and their families around the world. Stephen Burdick Hand is an 
inspiration to all those who dedicate their lives to serving their 
community. I, too, hope to carry his legacy with me as I continue to 
serve the people of Louisiana.
I stand here today to honor 
the incredible career of Joy Lynn Alexander, who recently retired as a 
Colonel after thirty years of dedicated service in the military. 
Colonel Alexander is a highly decorated officer who rose through the 
ranks of the Mississippi National Guard, eventually becoming the 
Commander of Camp McCain Training Site.
  Throughout her career, Colonel Alexander completed all the necessary 
professional military education courses, including the U.S. Army War 
College. Her numerous awards include the Legion of Merit and the Bronze 
Star Medal. She served in various roles, from tactical to strategic 
positions, and even completed a combat tour in Iraq in 2009 through 
2010, where I had the honor of serving alongside her.
  Colonel Alexander spent countless days, weeks, months, and years 
traveling across Mississippi, the United States, and the world to 
support and lead critical missions. Her dedication and hard work have 
taken her to many places, all in service to our country and state.
  As one of the most influential leaders in the Army, Colonel Alexander 
always maintained the highest standards, even during some of the most 
challenging times in history. She is a true American hero and a proud 
Mississippian. We are deeply grateful for her unwavering commitment to 
our country and to Mississippi. Her legacy of service and leadership 
will continue to inspire us all.
