      CELEBRATING EDUCATION AND SHARING DAY IN HONOR OF THE REBBE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DUSTY JOHNSON

                            of south dakota

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 16, 2024

  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, April 19, 2024, 
corresponding to the 11th of Nissan, marks the birthday of Rabbi 
Menachem M. Schneerson, known as ``the Rebbe.&#x27;&#x27; It is celebrated 
worldwide and in all 50 states across our great country, including my 
home state of South Dakota.
  This day is also observed as ``Education &amp; Sharing Day&#x27;&#x27; in 
recognition of the Rebbe&#x27;s deep commitment to bettering the education 
of all people. He emphasized that education should not merely be about 
imparting knowledge but must instill values essential for living a 
meaningful life, fostering moral character, and contributing to the 
betterment of individuals and society at large. These moral and ethical 
principles have served as the foundation of civilization since time 
immemorial.
  Like two of the greatest Jewish leaders known to humanity in their 
times, Moses and Maimonides, whom we honor with their bas-reliefs 
adorning the walls of this august body, the Rebbe provided leadership, 
guidance, and healing in our times. This body is honored to have 
awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal.
  The Rebbe said that from his earliest childhood days, he envisioned 
seeing the world come to a state of peace. Through decades of dedicated 
service and leadership, while guiding many of our nation&#x27;s leaders, he 
exemplified how humanity, through moral education, charitable deeds, 
and acts of kindness, can bring our world to a state where ``swords are 
turned into plowshares,&#x27;&#x27; with peace and prosperity for all inhabitants 
of God&#x27;s world.
  On the Rebbe&#x27;s birthday, it is fitting that we honor him by striving 
to apply his teachings with greater diligence, embodying his vision of 
a world illuminated by compassion and goodwill for all.

      CELEBRATING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF ABILENE BAPTIST CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RICK W. ALLEN

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 16, 2024

  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 250th 
anniversary of the Abilene Baptist Church in Georgia&#x27;s 12th District.
  Established near Augusta, Georgia and founded by the pioneering 
Baptist minister Daniel Marshall, the centuries-long history of Abilene 
continues to bring hope and unity of God&#x27;s word to our communities.
  As we reflect on 250 years of faith, fellowship, and service, we also 
remember the journey that has brought us to this moment--through the 
many challenges, countless blessings, and cherished milestones.
  This anniversary is not just a marker of time, but a testament to the 
unwavering dedication and commitment of each member of this 
congregation.
  One of my favorite passages in the Bible is God&#x27;s instructions to 
Joshua in Joshua 1:8: ``Do not let this book of law depart from your 
lips, be careful to do what it says, meditate on it day and night, and 
you will be prosperous and successful.&#x27;&#x27;
  This anniversary is undoubtedly a celebration, but also a reminder 
that God has used this congregation in a powerful way and continues to 
do so.
  I express my deepest gratitude to those who have contributed to the 
years of success of Abilene Baptist Church. May God bless each and 
every one of them.

                          ____________________

                        Tuesday, April 16, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the outstanding work of the Network of Victim Assistance (NOVA), as it 
commemorates its 50th year of service to the residents of Bucks County. 
NOVA stands as a beacon of hope and support for victims of serious 
crimes and their families. NOVA&#x27;s mission of providing support, 
counsel, and empowerment of victims of sexual assault and abuse in our 
region manifests itself through its tireless advocacy and community 
education.
  NOVA directly assists over 3,000 victims annually, providing them 
with crucial support and resources during their time of need. 
Additionally, their team of educators conducts personal safety training 
for approximately 30,000 individuals each year, spanning across 
different age groups from children to adults By utilizing individual 
and group counseling, victims of sexual assault and abuse can regain 
control of their lives, and through education programs, children and 
communities learn to be advocates for victims of abuse, as well as 
prevention and personal safety.
  By empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to protect 
themselves, NOVA plays a vital role in fostering safer communities. The 
organization&#x27;s reputation for delivering exemplary services and 
programs is well-deserved and wide recognized both statewide and 
beyond.
  In conclusion, as NOVA celebrates its 50th anniversary, let us 
commend and express our gratitude to all the staff, volunteers, and 
supporters who have contributed to its success over the years. I am 
thankful to work with their President, Sarah Larson, Executive 
Director, Penny Ettinger, and the many other NOVA staff and volunteers 
serving Bucks County. I am proud to support them in their mission to 
stand for victims in the fight to end sexual assault.

                                 ______

                        Tuesday, April 16, 2024

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Robbins Area 
Library for thirty years of service to the people of Moore County.
  Thirty years ago, this library was established to serve as a center 
for community and learning for the people of Robbins, North Carolina. 
Before it was built, folks had to travel to neighboring towns in order 
to visit a library. But now Robbin&#x27;s library has emerged as an integral 
part of the town. The library houses thousands of books, provides 
internet access in an area where coverage is limited, and caters to the 
learning of people of all ages. Additionally, it serves as a central 
meeting spot, hosting children&#x27;s events, book groups, movie groups, 
sports clubs, and more.
  Numerous folks have been integral to the success of this storied 
landmark. This includes people like Theron Bell, who was the chief 
advocate for the establishment of the library back in the 1990&#x27;s, and 
Clara Bernicken, a thirty-year veteran of the local library system and 
one of the lead story tellers at Robbins. They, and many others, have 
performed a tremendous service to our community in Moore County. I 
think I speak for everyone in Moore County in thanking them for all 
they have done and continue to do.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing the Robbins Area 
Library and all those who have helped it grow and develop on the 
thirtieth anniversary of its establishment.

   CONGRATULATING THE PICKETT COUNTY LADY BOBCATS ON CLAIMING STATE 
                              CHAMPIONSHIP

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 16, 2024

  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, for many of the folks I represent in the Upper 
Cumberland Region of Middle Tennessee, this year feels a lot like 1989.
  That&#x27;s the last time the Pickett County Lady Bobcats were named TSSAA 
girls basketball state champions. They reclaimed that title last month, 
when they defeated the Moore County Lady Raiders, 56-45, in the Class 
1A final.
  And this championship, Mr. Speaker, was a family affair. Lady Bobcats 
Guard Zoe Nicholas now joins her aunt and grandmother in having been 
members of a Pickett County state championship team. It doesn&#x27;t stop 
there. Nicholas&#x27; cousin, Callie Reeder, is also on the winning team and 
was even named tournament MVP.
  The coach that led the team to victory, Brent Smith, has a brother 
named Barry, who happened to coach the last winning team 35 years ago.
  It&#x27;s important to note that even though this is the first state 
championship in a while, the program does very well every season. It&#x27;s 
also important to note that each time the Lady Bobcats have made it out 
of the quarterfinals and advanced to the state championship, they&#x27;ve 
won. I want to congratulate the current champions for keeping that now 
six-time winning streak alive.
  I am proud to represent Pickett County, and many places like it, that 
take so much pride in their families, communities, and their home team.
  I would now like to recognize everyone who carried the team to 
victory. Players included: Senior Allie Amonett, Senior Ella K. 
Keisling, Junior Emmy Lowe, Junior Callie Reeder, Junior Kaylee 
Tompkins, Sophomore Addison Lowe, Sophomore Zoey Nicholas, Sophomore 
Kylie Wood, and Freshman Emma Tompkins. Managers included: Senior Nikki 
Gunter, Junior Addie Keisling, and Junior Ava Keisling. I&#x27;d

[[Page E359]]

also like to recognize Head Coach Brent Smith and Assistant Coach 
Rochelle Mason for the win.
  Again, congratulations to the Pickett County Lady Bobcats, the 2024 
TSSAA 1A Girls Basketball State Champions.

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate this week&#x27;s 
Hometown Hero, Leticia Ferrer. During last week&#x27;s solar eclipse, 
Leticia&#x27;s lifelong fascination with the movement of the sun and the 
moon gave her the opportunity to lead a project in North Texas funded 
by NASA. Leticia&#x27;s passion for things out-of-this-world started in 
childhood and she&#x27;s dedicated her life to documenting and filming 
eclipses across the globe. Collecting data on the sun throughout her 
viewings, last week the Farmer&#x27;s Branch native had the opportunity to 
work with the Citizen CATE project as a coordinator of scientific 
viewing teams of the eclipse at home in North Texas. The Citizen CATE 
project works with NASA and the National Science Foundation to collect 
data on the magnetic structure and energy of the sun&#x27;s corona. Leticia 
helped lead four teams of North Texans through the process of properly 
collecting the necessary data and using telescopes to gather images to 
be studied for years to come. I&#x27;m inspired by Leticia&#x27;s dedication to 
the advancement of solar science and thankful for her outreach in North 
Texas during the total solar eclipse.

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Lancaster 
Volunteer Ambulance Corps for its 71 years of emergency medical service 
to Western New York. Operating every day of every year, the volunteer 
first responders who comprise Lancaster Ambulance often serve as the 
first and most crucial contact for those suffering from profound 
medical distress. Lancaster Ambulance&#x27;s impact on Town of Lancaster, 
Village of Lancaster, Town of Alden, Village of Alden, and Village of 
Depew is unquestionable, with its volunteers responding to an 
astounding 7,553 calls last year alone. These dedicated emergency 
responders are treating our friends and neighbors amidst their darkest 
hours, and I am proud to recognize their community service and high 
level of professionalism in the line of duty.
  On behalf of Congress and the 23rd Congressional District, I commend 
the men and women serving as part of the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance 
Corp. I include in the Record the names of the Lancaster Ambulance 
Board and Management Team into the Record as a sign of respect and 
appreciation for their service and all the members of this important 
organization:
  Chester Popiolkowski--President
  William Revelas--Vice President

  Allison Abraham--Director
  John O&#x27;Donnell--Director
  Jonathan Hunter--Director
  Robert Sank--Chief of Compliance
  Brian Fenik--Chief of Narcotics
  Lynn O&#x27;Donnell--Training Coordinator
  I ask that this legislative body joins me in celebrating the 
Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps for its over seven decades of 
service. We thank the many generations of first responders who have 
protected the Town of Lancaster and its surrounding area through this 
exemplary organization.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, 
David Gonzalez, who is a valued volunteer with several community 
organizations in Hernando County and has been a long-time employee of 
our community&#x27;s electric cooperative, Withlacoochee River Electric 
Cooperative. In this capacity, he has served as the face of the 
organization in the community, presenting millions of dollars if credit 
refunds to local governments and school boards. Mr. Gonzalez has also 
served in key leadership roles on the Board of Directors for several 
non-profits in Hernando with the highest levels of dedication, 
including: the Hernando Chamber of Commerce, Hernando Education 
Foundation, Hernando Economic Development Council, Oak Hill Hospital 
Board, and the United Way of Hernando Board. Whenever there has been a 
need, Mr. Gonzalez has stepped forward to address it, without concern 
for who gets the credit. A truly humble problem-solver, Mr.

[[Page E357]]

Gonzalez embodies the concept of servant leadership and has made a 
lasting impact on the organizations and communities he has served. 
While we wish him all the best in his upcoming retirement, we know that 
his departure from the cooperative will leave behind a void that will 
not easily be replaced.
  It is clear that Mr. Gonzalez has made a profoundly positive impact 
on our community, and I am grateful for his service.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions of one of my constituents, Ms. Janine Kell. Ms. 
Kell is an engaged and dedicated volunteer with Warrior 321, an anti-
human trafficking awareness group. Most recently, Janine was 
instrumental in hosting the community&#x27;s second annual Light Up the 
Night Hernando event to bring awareness about human trafficking to the 
county.
  Janine never sleeps and has truly dedicated her life in every way to 
fighting on behalf of the vulnerable. In addition to her work to 
prevent the horrific crime of human trafficking, Janine regularly 
speaks at local schools, educating students on the Monique Burr 
curriculum. The Monique Burr curriculum is a

comprehensive, evidence-based program for kids in grades K-5. It 
empowers children and relevant adults with information and strategies 
to prevent, recognize, and appropriately respond to bullying, 
cyberbullying, abuse, and digital abuse dangers. Beyond advocacy, 
Janine will often work directly with children who have been victims of 
abuse to help ensure they get the support they need to fully recover. 
Her compassion and empathy know no bounds.
  It is clear that Ms. Kell has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community and on the lives of countless people she has worked with. 
I am grateful for her service.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, 
Joe Marina, who is a valued volunteer with several community 
organizations and has been a long-time employee of our community&#x27;s 
electric cooperative, Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative. In this 
capacity, he has served as the face of the organization in the 
community, presenting millions of dollars of credit refunds to local 
governments and school boards. Mr. Marina embodies the heart of a true 
public servant, lending his expertise, passion, time and energy into 
all he has been involved with. He has served in key leadership roles on 
the Board of Directors for United Way of Pasco, the Pasco Economic 
Development Council, the Boys and Girls Club, the Vincent House and 
several other local nonprofits. Mr. Marina doesn&#x27;t just lend his name 
to a cause; when he commits to something, he goes ``all-in&#x27;&#x27;--above and 
beyond to make a lasting imprint on the lives of those his work 
touches. For more than 25 years, whenever there has been an unmet need 
in the community, Mr. Marina has stepped up to the plate to make sure 
the job is done, and done right. He has worked tirelessly on countless 
large-scale community projects to enrich the lives of the people of 
Pasco County and to create opportunities for future residents. He has 
helped to transform Pasco from a bedroom community to one in which 
people can truly live, play and work. His compassion and his desire to 
empower others to realize their full potential knows no bounds. As he 
embarks upon his well-deserved retirement, he leaves behind a legacy of 
selfless service, commitment to others, and humble leadership. His 
shoes will be big to fill.
  It is clear that Mr. Marina has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community, and I am grateful for his service.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, 
Mark McClarty, who has been a volunteer with the non-profit, People 
Helping People (PHP) since 2023. Mark stepped up to manage the 
organization&#x27;s Weekend Blessings program which provides four meals per 
weekend to children facing food insecurity. The program also feeds 
these children throughout the summer. Careful coordination with the 
Hernando County School District and other organizations is required to 
make this initiative successful, and Mark works tirelessly to get the 
job done. Mark&#x27;s background in finance and his people skills are so 
incredibly valuable. He continually finds innovative ways to lower the 
costs while increasing value of the food PHP purchases for the program. 
Under his leadership, the Weekend Blessings initiative has grown, as it 
now serves an additional 150 needy children each week. The efficiencies 
he has implemented for this initiative have also been replicated within 
PHP&#x27;s senior feeding program. His positive attitude is infectious.
  It is clear that Mr. McClarty has made a profoundly positive impact 
on our community, and I am grateful for his service.

                                 ______

                        Tuesday, April 16, 2024

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions made in our community by the lvanovsky Family. The 
Twistid Arts Initiative was born out of the desire to raise awareness 
of and increase access to all forms of visual and performing arts in 
Citrus County. Prior to the creation of this non-profit organization, 
youth in Citrus County had limited opportunities for exposure to 
successful arts-based careers. In response, this non-profit 
organization was developed to provide innovative programming, hands-on 
education, and immersive events throughout the community.
  The lvanovsky Family has jumped in to help at every Twistid Arts 
event that has been held to date. They are extremely dedicated to the 
cause and are willing to do even the most menial tasks to ensure events 
and programs run smoothly. Part of what makes our country so great is 
the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to 
selflessly give back to others. Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones 
of our society and part of the fabric that unites us.
  It is clear that the Ivanovsky Family is making a profoundly positive 
impact on our community, and I am grateful for their service.
