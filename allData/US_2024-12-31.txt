       HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SENATOR RICHARD F. COLBURN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ANDY HARRIS

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 31, 2024

  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, this past Friday I learned with great 
sadness about the passing of Senator Richard Colburn, a dedicated 
public servant and an Eastern Shore patriot who devoted his life to the 
service and betterment of the people of the State of Maryland.
  Senator Colburn and I served together in the Maryland State Senate. 
He arrived to the Maryland General Assembly first as a State Delegate 
about sixteen years prior to my being elected to the Maryland Senate in 
1999. By that time, Rich Colburn had already been serving as a State 
Senator for four years. He quickly became my mentor, dear colleague, 
and a trusted friend. For a period, Rich and I served on the Education, 
Health and Environmental Affairs Committee. As a devoted Eastern 
Shoreman and a son of a waterman, Senator Colburn knew how crucial it 
is for the government to be accountable, transparent, honest, and 
helpful to its citizens. As such, he made constituent casework and 
assisting his fellow Marylanders his top priroity.
  As a ``Shore Senator,&#x27;&#x27; Rich fought on behalf of his constituents 
with fervor and purpose. During his time in the legislature, he 
introduced hundreds of bills, at times reaching across the aisle to 
promote projects and priorities he believed would benefit the Shore. 
One of his greatest accomplishments was the multi-decade battle led to 
his securing over $60 million to replace the Dover Bridge; a vital 
artery connecting Southern Caroline and Talbot Counties on the Eastern 
Shore. The bridge finally opened in 2018 with great fanfare. Among his 
many other accomplishments was his success in the preservation of the 
Easton hospital, widening U.S. Route 50, increasing benefits for 
veterans and law enforcement, and obtaining funding for restoration of 
the Chesapeake Bay&#x27;s oyster population. He advocated for businesses and 
tourism on the Shore to lift and support the local economy by helping 
provide funding for the Choptank River Lighthouse and bringing in the 
Hyatt hotel to Cambridge, among others.
  Richard Franklin Colburn was born on February 9, 1950 and grew up in 
Oxford, Maryland. After graduating from the Easton High School, Rich 
served in the United States Army Security Agency posted in Germany 
during the height of the Cold War. He left after three years with the 
Army, achieving the rank of Sergeant. After his return to Maryland, he 
worked in private practice. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 
1983, where he served until 1991 before he ascended to the State Senate 
in 1995. Senator Colburn became the longest serving Republican Senator

[[Page E1336]]

in the Senate. After his service in elected office, he served as 
Special Assistant to Agriculture Secretary Joe Bartenfelder under 
Governor Larry Hogan. His district included the counties of Caroline, 
Dorchester, Talbot and Wicomico.
  Senator Richard Colburn passed away suddenly on Friday, December 27, 
2024, in Easton at the age of 74 years old. I would like to express my 
sincere condolences to his loving wife Alma, daughter Johanna Hamilton 
(Bobby), granddaughter Saylor and sister Marie, as well as the entire 
extended Colburn family and friends. The Eastern Shore is forever 
grateful for Senator Colburn&#x27;s commitment to service and his dedication 
to Maryland.

                HONORING THE LIFE OF MARVIN REASER, Jr.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 31, 2024

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Marvin Dennis Reaser, 
Jr., who passed away on August 20 at the age of 84. Mr. Reaser was a 
talented musician and beloved band director whose career spanned over 
30 years in Salem, Virginia, most notably leaving a lasting impact on 
Salem High School.
  Mr. Reaser was born on July 28, 1940, in Nitro, West Virginia. His 
parents, Artie Lda Shomo and Marvin Dennis Reaser, Sr., raised him in 
St. Albans, West Virginia, with a very modest family lifestyle.
  Music remained a necessity for the Reaser household, with piano 
lessons being a requirement for Mr. Reaser, his sister, Sally, and his 
brother, David. During his tenure at St. Albans Jr. High, Mr. Reaser 
played in the High School Band, which was directed by Alan Farley. Mr. 
Farley saw something remarkable about Mr. Reaser&#x27;s musical ability and 
would not soon forget his four-year impact on the school.
  Mr. Reaser then enlisted in the United States Navy after attending 
one year of college. He served for four years in the Navy, from Africa 
to Saudi Arabia, playing his trumpet for the Navy Band. Upon Mr. 
Reaser&#x27;s return from his service overseas, he landed two teaching jobs 
as band director for two different high schools, notably without a 
college degree--a testament to his skill and talent.
  By 1968, Mr. Reaser earned his undergraduate degree from Morris 
Harvey College (now University of Charleston) in Charleston, West 
Virginia. This same year, his former high school band director, Mr. 
Farley, who had been working at Andrew Lewis High School in Salem, VA, 
reached out to Mr. Reaser asking for him to apply to the Band Director 
job there. After landing the job one year later, Mr. Reaser joined a 
team that would shape his career for the next 30 years. With Mr. 
Reaser&#x27;s directing style closely mirroring what he had learned from the 
United States Navy, the award-winning Andrew Lewis High Band was widely 
known for their student-led governance with emphasis on excellence and 
hard work.
  When Andrew Lewis HS closed and its students were merged into Salem 
High School (Salem, VA), he became the band leader there.
  Mr. Reaser, throughout his tenure as a band director, participated in 
a number of complementary pursuits, such as playing trumpet for gigs in 
the surrounding areas of Southwest Virginia, authoring a book, and even 
earning his master&#x27;s degree in music composition from Radford 
University.
  In 2001, Mr. Reaser earned a key to the city from the Salem City 
Council, marking his retirement from Salem City Schools on a day that 
was dubbed ``Dennis Reaser Day&#x27;&#x27; by the City of Salem. However, he knew 
he had more to teach and went on to work as a band director for the 
Hargrave Military Academy for three years and then assistant principal 
for First Flight High School for over 10 years.
  Mr. Reaser retired for good in 2015 and spent the remainder of his 
life composing and arranging music, playing in community bands and 
surrounding himself with his family and friends. Mr. Reaser 
unfortunately was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s Disease in his final seven 
years, but always stayed ahead of his disease, averaging five to ten 
thousand steps per day instead of allowing the symptoms to overcome 
him.
  While I was never a member of the Andrew Lewis High School marching 
band as a student there, I was proud to know Mr. Reaser and admired his 
work both with the marching band and all the other programs, 
particularly the annual Opus.
  Mr. Marvin Dennis Reaser, Jr. was a true example of someone who 
delivers excellence to communities with his passion for music. He will 
be remembered for his outstanding work as a teacher, a veteran, and 
family man.

  Mrs. CARTER. I rise today to honor three remarkable educators from 
the 18th Congressional District of Texas whose dedication and impact 
inspire students and strengthen our community.
  From KIPP Texas-Houston who serve over 21,000 students, I would like 
to recognize:
  Caleb Thomas, a third-grade math teacher, engages students with 
hands-on activities and real-world connections, igniting a love for 
learning.
  His teaching philosophy centers on creating an engaging and inclusive 
learning environment that ignites a passion for learning.
  He prioritizes student engagement through a blend of hands-on 
activities, technology, and real-world connections, ensuring that 
learning is not only enjoyable but also impactful.
  Dr. AiMee Morant the proud school leader at KIPP Mosaic Primary.
  She leads through her strong belief in foundational literacy and 
numeracy and believes deeply that students must craft their own 
narrative through a rich understanding of themselves and their culture.
  Dr. Khalilah Campbell-Rhone, Deputy Superintendent of Transformation, 
has transformed underperforming school into thriving educational hubs, 
leaving a lasting legacy.
  She has also turned around campuses in Houston ISD including Sam 
Houston High School, Thomas Middle School, Worthing High School, and

  These educators remind us that teaching is not just a profession, but 
a calling to shape future generations.
  Their unwavering commitment to excellence deserves our gratitude and 
continued support.
  I thank these educators for their tireless dedication to our children 
and communities.
