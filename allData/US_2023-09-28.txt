        CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF THE MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN S. DUARTE

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 28, 2023

  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the Modesto Irrigation 
District is celebrating 100 years of supplying clean, reliable power to 
our communities. Since the construction of the Don Pedro Dam and the 
coinciding establishment of the Don Pedro Powerhouse, Modesto 
Irrigation District has been providing the City of Modesto and the 
surrounding areas with power that has brought innovation, growth, and 
development to the region.
  In 1919, a bill was introduced to provide for the development of 
power by irrigation districts. Governor William D. Stephens signed the 
bill into law May 21, 1919. Three days before the bill was to become 
effective, construction of the Don Pedro Dam and Powerhouse began.
  On October 27. 1921. the first concrete was poured at the dam. With 
construction of both the Don Pedro Dam and Powerhouse underway, the 
decision was made for the plants to generate and distribute their own 
power. In 1923, Modesto Irrigation District raised its first power 
pole. It took determined, fearless people with incredible foresight to 
accomplish such an achievement despite the presence of a powerful and 
already established, competitive private utility.
  Throughout the years, the successes of the retail distribution of 
power out of Modesto Irrigation District continued. In 1950, there was 
a net energy profit of $1 million-a-year as shown by the electrical 
department, and energy consumption increased 10 percent per year in the 
post-war years.
  Due to being publicly owned and locally controlled, the Modesto 
Irrigation District could provide the people of Modesto and the 
surrounding area with lower energy rates than private utilities. These 
lower rates helped grow Modesto and the surrounding region in both the 
residential and industrial fields at a rapid rate.
  Today, 100 years since the introduction of retail power in the 
region, Modesto Irrigation District serves an area of 560 square miles 
with electricity. This electricity is transmitted over 1,800 miles of 
power lines throughout their service area. The District relies on a 
diverse, balanced power resource mix to meet customers&#x27; needs. 
Embracing the latest technology and sustainable practices. Modesto 
Irrigation District continues to be a leader in the public power 
industry.
  Through the courageous determination of their founders, Modesto 
Irrigation District evolved into a robust and self-reliant community-
owned utility. On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 1311, 
Congressional District. I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations 
to Modesto Irrigation District for 100 years of service and offer my 
sincerest wishes to their future.

                          ____________________

  Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th 
wedding anniversary of Chuck and Debby Garriott.
  Reverend Charles ``Chuck&#x27;&#x27; Michael Garriott and Deborah ``Debby&#x27;&#x27; 
Cacace Garriott met while they were both in high school and married 
January 26, 1974, in Pikesville, Maryland, both at the age of 20. Their 
marriage has brought about the blessing of four children and seven 
grandchildren. Their son Phillip and his wife Brooke Garriott have four 
children: Blevin. Kiefer, Hazel, and Harper. Their daughter Katie and 
husband Tony Yang have three children: Avery, Linus, and Cason. Their 
daughter Anna lives in Washington, D.C., and their son Peter in Los 
Angeles, California.
  Chuck and Debby have used their life together to invest in friends 
and family. Chuck served as a pastor in Oklahoma for many years and has 
served as the Executive Director of Ministry to State, a ministry that 
has invested in the spiritual lives of our leaders in the Nation&#x27;s 
Capital, since 2004. Debby cares for patients as a physical therapist 
while also investing in the lives of men and women through Ministry to 
State.
  They enjoy spending time with their family and at the beach. Debby 
enjoys her community garden plot and Chuck enjoys writing and

             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 27, 2023

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Jackson Lee 
Amendment No. 90 to H.R. 4365--the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 2024.
  I want to thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee for making this 
amendment in order.
  The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 90 is an important and potentially 
life-saving amendment in an unfortunate and distracting appropriations 
bill.
  Namely, the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 90 seeks to allocate $10 
million to fund Triple Negative Breast Cancer Research (``TNBC&#x27;&#x27;).
  I must offer my appreciation to both the military and the Biden 
administration for making research into breast cancer a priority, but 
there is still work to be done.
  Breast cancer accounts for 12.5 percent of all new annual cancer 
cases worldwide, making it the most common cancer in the world.
  This issue is extremely important, especially for the brave men and 
women in the military, who are up to 20-40 percent more likely to 
develop breast cancer.
  There are few people in this country whose lives have not been 
touched by breast cancer.
  Yet, there are persistent disparities in breast cancer incidence and 
death rates:
  Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the 
United States for Black and Hispanic women.
  Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than women of 
any other racial or ethnic group.
  Experts believe that it&#x27;s partially because about 1 in 5 Black women 
is diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, more than any other 
racial or ethnic group.
  Compared with non-Hispanic white women, Black women are less likely 
to receive guideline adherent care and have an approximate 2-fold 
higher mortality incidence, resulting in a disproportionately higher 
risk of death from Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
  Triple Negative Breast Cancer (``TNBC&#x27;&#x27;) is one of many forms of 
breast cancer and accounts for about 15-30 percent of all diagnosed 
invasive breast cancer cases in the United States.
  Due to its aggressive behavior, TNBC grows quickly and is more likely 
to have spread at the time it is found and is more likely to come back 
after treatment than other types of breast cancer.
  TNBC cells do not contain (are ``negative for&#x27;&#x27;) three key receptors 
that medicines typically target in other types of breast cancers; 
therefore, there are limited treatment options that can be used to 
treat the cancer.
  Patients with an early diagnosis can often be treated with 
chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery; however, the limited therapies 
available specifically addressing the management of TNBC has made 
treating this disease a challenge for clinicians.
  Recent innovation in targeted therapies have fueled advances in the 
fight against TNBC.
  Advances in breast cancer screening and treatment over the last few 
decades have reduced the overall breast cancer mortality rate, yet the 
disproportionate impact of TNBC on racial and ethnic minority 
communities raises considerations about the underlying determinants 
driving the disparities.
  It is necessary to promote TNBC education, raise awareness about the 
disease-related disparities, and tackle inequities within the health 
care delivery such as inadequate access to screening, diagnostic 
testing, and care, to improve early detection and survival.
  The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 90 would allow for more research so we 
can one day hopefully learn a way to reduce the number of military 
personnel affected by breast cancer.
  We all know, by the way, that breast cancer can affect both men and 
women.
  The bad news is breast cancer has been just about as brutal on women 
in the military as combat.
  Let me say that sentence again. Breast cancer has been just about as 
brutal on women in the military as combat.
  More than 800 women have been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
according to the Army Times; 874 military women were diagnosed with 
breast cancer just between 2000 and 2011. And according to that same 
study, more are suspected. It grows.
  The good news is that we have been working on it, and I want to add 
my appreciation to the military. This amendment, however, will allow 
for the additional research needed.
  As new young women come into the United States military, as women 
stay longer in the United States military, as women get older in the 
United States military, as women ascend to leadership roles in the 
United States military, these dollars provide research.
  Not only is breast cancer striking relatively young military women at 
an alarming rate, but male service members, veterans and their 
dependents are at risk as well.
  With a younger and generally healthier population, those in the 
military tend to have a lower risk for most cancers than civilians--
including significantly lower colorectal, lung and cervical--but breast 
cancer is a different story.
  Military people in general, and in some cases very specifically, are 
at a significantly greater risk for contracting breast cancer, says Dr. 
Richard Clapp, a top cancer expert at Boston University who works at 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on military breast 
cancer issues. He says life in the military can mean exposure to a 
witch&#x27;s brew of risk factors directly linked to greater chances of 
getting breast cancer.
  So, my friends, I am asking that we do the right thing.
  We are on the right track, we are on the right rail, we are on the 
right road.
   But with the expansion of women in the military, I can assure you, 
for long life, a vital service that these men and women give, it is 
extremely important to move forward with this amendment.
  Researchers have pointed to a higher use of oral contraception in the 
military than in the general population, and oral contraception has 
long been linked to breast cancer among women--an alarming factor that 
would ensure that this particular amendment would be a positive step 
forward.
  Despite significant advancements in prevention, diagnoses and 
treatment, more progress can and must be made, not only to reduce the 
fatality rate of breast cancer, but also to research methods of 
prevention and ways to drastically reduce risk factors.
  To this end, I have over the years been successful in winning passage 
of several Jackson Lee Amendments to the National Defense 
Appropriations Act in prior years to improve breast cancer research 
across the United States.
  I am here today seeking support for the same amendment to provide 
increased funding for the Defense Health Program&#x27;s research and 
development by $10 million. These funds would specifically address the 
issue of breast cancer in the United States military.
  Several initiatives I have designed in the past have aided active-
duty servicemen and women along with veterans, such as enforcing 
accurate reporting of maternity mortality rates among the Armed Forces, 
addressing physical and mental health concerns, and securing 
authorization for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as well as Triple 
Negative Breast Cancer research funding.
  Additionally, I have introduced H.R. Bo, the Triple-Negative Breast 
Cancer Research and Education Act of 2013, which focuses on expanding, 
intensifying, and coordinating programs for the conduct and support of 
research on triplenegative breast cancer, a type of breast cancer that 
is difficult to detect but disproportionately impacts African American 
and Hispanic women.
  I am very proud of the work that I and Congress have done to address 
the health concerns of active duty and veteran servicemen and women, 
but there are still improvements to be made.
  As a breast cancer survivor myself, I understand the toll which this 
destructive disease takes on patients and their family members.
  Support and encouragement are invaluable resources to those battling

[[Page E908]]

cancer, and spreading awareness of one of the most pressing health 
concerns can help minimize the burden on those currently fighting.
  The men and women who are on the front lines or have already 
completed their valiant service to this country have many pressing 
issues and challenges they already must face; breast cancer should not 
be one of them.
  Our service members fight and sacrifice for our freedoms.
  Now, as lawmakers, we should be working to ensure to protect their 
lives and freedoms--not trying to take their rights away.
  While the negatives of this defense appropriations bill 
disappointedly outweigh my positive amendment, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 90--notwithstanding my 
strong opposition and encouragement to vote down the underlying bill.

HASC HEARING ON EXAMINING IRREGULARITY IN THE STRATEGIC BASING PROCESS 
                         FOR U.S. SPACE COMMAND

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 28, 2023

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, America is grateful for 
the leadership of Chairman Mike Rogers of Alabama for his vision and 
persistence to support the creation of U.S. Space Command along with 
President Donald Trump. This recognizes the threats of dictators, war 
criminal Putin and the CCP who have developed capabilities in space to 
threaten American families--we can achieve peace through strength.
  It is sad when political interference controls basing, not first the 
priority of national security.
  In South Carolina, we experienced this as the Charleston Naval Base 
was re-located to New Hampshire. The obvious advantages of Charleston 
with a temperate climate of unlimited operations was ignored as the 
then Senate Majority Leader was from Maine with his constituents 
commuting to New Hampshire.
  Congressman Austin Scott is correct. Now Politics determines where 
the missions go. This is a dangerous game, with national security to 
suffer.

  Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that 
I take this time to honor Ms. Beth Wrobel and wish her well upon her 
retirement as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HealthLinc. For her 
lifelong commitment to providing quality health care to communities 
throughout the region, she is to be commended.
  In 2002, Ms. Wrobel became CEO of HealthLinc. At the time, HealthLinc 
was a single, free medical clinic serving the local community. Under 
her direction, HealthLinc expanded its medical services to include 
pediatrics, women&#x27;s health, and prenatal care, while also adding 
service lines including dental, optometry, behavioral health, substance 
abuse, podiatry, chiropractic, clinical pharmacy, health insurance 
enrollment, medical legal partnership, and more. The organization 
continues to grow and is comprised of twelve clinics across Northern 
Indiana, as well as two school-based telehealth clinics, one mobile 
medical and dental clinic, and a team of more than 490 employees. As 
CEO, Ms. Wrobel has worked tirelessly to ensure the accessibility of 
affordable, quality care to countless individuals and families who are 
underinsured, uninsured, or unable to pay. For her outstanding 
dedication to the people of Northern Indiana, especially those most in 
need, Ms. Wrobel is worthy of the highest praise.
  In addition to her noteworthy career, Ms. Wrobel has offered her time 
and support to numerous foundations and organizations throughout the 
years. Among her many leadership roles, Ms. Wrobel has served on the 
board of directors for the National Association of Community Health 
Centers, and she currently serves as trustee for Ivy Tech Community 
College&#x27;s Valparaiso Campus. She is also a member of the board of 
directors for the Indiana Primary Healthcare Association.
  Ms. Wrobel&#x27;s dedication to serving the residents of Northern Indiana 
is exceeded only by her love and devotion to her three sons, Chris, 
Tom, and David, her daughter-in-law, Heather, and her cherished 
grandson, J.J. I wish her quality time with her family in the years to 
come.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues 
join me in honoring Ms. Beth Wrobel for her unwavering commitment to 
improving health care throughout Northern Indiana and beyond and in 
wishing her well upon her retirement. For her many remarkable 
contributions, Ms. Wrobel is worthy of our deepest gratitude and

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 28, 2023

  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Suicide Prevention 
Month. We know our country is in the midst of a severe mental health 
crisis, and people are struggling. After declines in the suicide rate 
from 2019 to 2020, the rates increased almost percent in 2021. 
Provisional data from the CDC shows that the rate is continuing to 
rise, up 2.6 percent from 2021 to 2022. According to this data, which 
is not yet final, we lost about 49,450 people to suicide in 2022.
  This is a dire situation, but we have tools to help save lives and 
the opportunity to transform how we as a nation respond to suicide, 
mental health, and substance use crises. I am grateful to my colleagues 
for supporting the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline. Formerly the National 
Suicide Prevention Lifeline, the 988 Lifeline has helped connect 
millions of individuals across the country with support and resources 
in their darkest hours. Since its transition to the 988-dialing code 
from the longer, 10-digit hotline in July of 2022, the Lifeline has 
received almost 5 million contacts (through calls, chats, and texts). 
Vibrant Emotional Health, the administrator of the Lifeline, estimates 
that this number could reach 9 million in the next fiscal year (FY24).
  We must ensure that anyone in crisis--regardless of the time of day, 
or where they are--has someone to talk to, someone to respond, and a 
safe place to go. Continued federal investment is critical for the 988 
Lifeline to sustain the crisis care continuum and build out the call 
centers, as well as mobile crisis response teams and crisis 
stabilization facilities.
  Suicide does not discriminate and impacts all communities, with some 
populations being at increased risk. For example, between 2018 and 
2021, increases in age-adjusted suicide rates were highest amongst 
Native Americans (26 percent), with Blacks (19.2 percent) and Hispanics 
(6.8 percent) also experiences significant increases. Other 
disproportionately impacted populations include Veterans, people living 
in rural areas, LGBTQ people, middle-aged and older adults, tribal 
populations, and youth.
  Vibrant estimates that about 80 percent of chat and text contacts are 
initiated by youth and young adults. We must meet children and 
adolescents where they are and ensure that chat and text capacity is 
strong enough to meet this great demand. To address mental health 
challenges among our youth, I will be reintroducing the Peer-to-Peer 
Suicide Prevention Act, which would help young people support their 
mental health byestablishing a competitive grant program for middle and 
high-schools to facilitate student-led suicide prevention programs.
  A study from Pew Charitable Trusts earlier this year revealed that 
only about 13 percent of adults in the US are aware of the 988 Suicide 
&amp; Crisis Lifeline. The 988 Lifeline represents a chance to change how 
our country supports those in crisis; it cannot reach its potential if 
most people are unaware of its existence, and of its numerous resources 
and supports it can offer them when they need them most. A coordinated, 
national suicide prevention public awareness campaign is necessary to 
educate people across the country of what 988 has to offer. That&#x27;s why 
I will be reintroducing the Campaign to Prevent Suicide Act to support 
culturally competent advertisements across the lifespan.
  Suicide prevention has long been an important issue to me. I 
encourage all of my colleagues to join me this month in raising 
awareness and supporting legislation that promotes mental health and 
suicide prevention to help save lives.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 28, 2023

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a passionate civil 
rights advocate, trusted community voice, and humble public servant. 
South Carolina State Representative David James Mack III transitioned 
from this life on September 20, 2023, in Charleston, South Carolina. He 
will be well remembered and sorely missed.
  David Mack III was born on December 13, 1953, in Charleston, South 
Carolina to David J. Mack, Jr. and Dorothy Mack. Representative Mack 
attended Charleston public schools and pursued higher education at 
Howard University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree 
in 1975. There he joined Omega Psi Phi, my own fraternity, which he 
credited with having played a pivotal role in shaping his values and 
his work throughout his life. He embodied the cardinal principles he 
learned as a proud member of our Omega brotherhood: Manhood, 
Scholarship, Perseverance, and Uplift.
  The value of community service was instilled in Representative Mack 
early in his life. After graduating from Howard, he returned to 
Charleston and began working at the Committee on Better Racial 
Assurance (COBRA). At COBRA, he dedicated himself to the organization&#x27;s 
mission of bringing about equality in the Charleston community and 
providing services for individuals and families with Sickle Cell 
Anemia. Representative Mack served at the organization for 47 years in 
various capacities, including Part-Time Assistant Director, Coordinator 
of Sickle Cell Services, and Part-Time Hemoglobinopathy Counselor. He 
also served on COBRA&#x27;s Board of Directors until his passing.
  In addition to his work at COBRA, Representative Mack served the 
Charleston community in numerous ways. He worked with the Carolina 
Youth Development Center and served on the Boards of Directors of the 
Opportunities Industrialization Center and the South Carolina Substance 
Abuse Commission. He was also a passionate civil rights advocate and 
served on the Board of the South Carolina Coalition for Black Voter 
Participation. He was a member of the North Charleston Branch of the 
NAACP and Charleston Chapter of Rainbow PUSH.
  Representative Mack was a firm believer in the notion that knowledge 
is power and relished the opportunity to communicate important 
information to the people of Charleston. He became the host of the WPAL 
Radio station talk show ``Open Rap&#x27;&#x27; in 1979, and ``Drive Time 
Dialogue&#x27;&#x27; in 1986. At Sunrise Communications of Charleston, where 
Representative Mack served as president, he created the PM Urban 
Edition talk show. Most recently, David created The David Mack Radio 
Show where he had conversations with civil leaders, academics, and 
health professionals in the Charleston community.
  Representative Mack was elected to the South Carolina House of 
Representatives for District 109 in 1997 and served in the South 
Carolina General Assembly for 24 years. Deeply respected by colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle, he served with distinction on the

Labor, Commerce, and Industry; Judiciary; and Medical, Military, and 
Municipal Affairs committees. He was also a proud member of the South 
Carolina Legislative Black Caucus and was elected by his peers to serve 
as Chairman.
  A man of faith, Representative Mack was a longtime member and leader 
of the historic Old Bethel United Methodist Church in downtown 
Charleston. He was beloved by his family, and together with his wife 
Sheryl Ann they had 3 sons--David IV, Brandon, and Daniel.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in recognizing 
the life and legacy of Representative David Mack III. The entire 
Charleston community and the state of South Carolina is grateful for 
his lifetime of public service. He leaves a rich legacy that will 
continue to touch generations of South Carolinians for years to come.
