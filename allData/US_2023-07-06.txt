               COMMUNITY IS STRONGER THAN CANCER DAY 2023

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, July 6, 2023

  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with people 
across America who marked June 28, 2023 as Community Is Stronger Than 
Cancer Day.
  For those whose lives have been impacted by cancer, the community 
that is found in this shared experience is an opportunity for hope, for 
comfort, and even joy. Toward this end, I want to recognize the Cancer 
Support Community, a global non-profit network of 190 locations, 
including Gilda&#x27;s Clubs, hospital and clinic partnerships, and 
satellite locations that deliver more than $50 million in free support 
and navigation services to patients and families. They also provide a 
compassionate and engaged community for people who experienced a cancer 
diagnosis themselves or who support a loved one.
  The Cancer Support Community reaches more than one million people 
each year, providing both in-person and virtual services as well as 
educational and digital resources. My district is home to those who can 
seek support and programming at one of two Cancer Support Community 
locations in Florida, and I ask all my colleagues to review where there 
currently are locations in or near their districts and to learn more 
about the important services being provided in their communities.
  The Cancer Support Community also maintains a toll-free national 
Cancer Support Helpline. It is crucial to note that all their services 
are led by licensed healthcare professionals and resource experts. 
Additionally, their headquarter staff conducts cutting-edge research 
that sheds light on the realities of coping with a cancer diagnosis, 
including the emotional, psychological, and financial impact. so I 
encourage all my colleagues to learn more about them.
  There are more than 18 million cancer patients and survivors in the 
United States, and for every one cancer patient, there are at least 
three others impacted by the diagnosis--spouse, partner, child, 
caregiver, and employer. A cancer diagnosis is life changing and, for 
some, can be overwhelming and distressing. I applaud the Cancer Support 
Community and its network partners for the extraordinary work they do 
every day easing the burdens of cancer and eliminating barriers to 
care. I commend their unwavering commitment to ensuring that all people 
impacted by cancer know that there are individuals and organizations 
that are ready to support them as they cope with the challenges that 
come with this complex diagnosis.
  As the Cancer Support Community emphasizes: ``While we have witnessed 
many significant advances in treating this devastating disease, nothing 
takes the place of the power, inspiration, companionship, and 
connection that comes from community. We are here to provide relevant 
and highly personalized support when and where it is needed most 
because Community Is Stronger Than Cancer.&#x27;&#x27;

   INTRODUCTION OF AN ACT TO EXPAND THE MISSION OF THE NATIONAL PARK 
  SERVICE TO INCLUDE ACTIVE USE OF SYSTEM UNITS LOCATED IN URBAN AREAS

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, July 6, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bill that would expand 
the mission of the National Park Service (NPS) to include active use of 
National Park System units located in urban areas. The idea for this 
bill came from a new report authored by George Washington University&#x27;s 
Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness that 
examined strategies to create a more equitable and activated park 
system in the District of Columbia.
  As the report notes, NPS parks in D.C. are ``inconsistently managed 
and inequitably maintained&#x27;&#x27; and ``do not meet the needs of people who 
both live near and experience the park system as a part of their daily 
lives.&#x27;&#x27; Efforts to activate and improve local parks have been hindered 
by limitations on NPS&#x27;s statutory authority. NPS&#x27;s primary mission is 
to preserve spaces for the enjoyment of future generations. This noble 
mission was crafted for the purpose of wilderness preservation, 
allowing nature to remain untouched by time. However, in addition to 
grand national parks, NPS also owns neighborhood parks in urban areas. 
For example, more than 20 percent of D.C. land consists of parkland, 
and NPS owns nearly 90 percent of it, over two-thirds of which is 
local, neighborhood parks, smaller than one acre. These parks could 
benefit from improvements that prioritize community engagement, 
including trails, playgrounds and benches. However, NPS&#x27;s mission is 
limited to preserving land as it currently exists. This mission is ill-
suited to address the unique and immediate needs of urban neighborhood 
parks.
  This bill would expand the mission of NPS to include the promotion of 
active use of its parks located in urban areas. Active use prioritizes 
current enjoyment by people and improves quality of life, including 
playgrounds, pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly infrastructure, sports 
and recreation facilities, community events, programming and 
concessions. This expanded mission would only apply to parks located in 
areas that have been defined and designated as ``urban&#x27;&#x27; in the most 
recent decennial census by the Secretary of Commerce, and would not 
impact wilderness areas.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, July 6, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I reintroduce the ``Stop Pentagon 
Price Gouging Act&#x27;&#x27; with Representative DeLuzio (D-PA-17) as the 
original cosponsor. I thank U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and 
Mike Braun (R-IN) for sponsoring the companion bill. These important 
reforms will protect taxpayers from being overcharged for goods 
procured by the Department of Defense.
  Our bicameral, bipartisan bill would close loopholes in current 
acquisition laws, tie financial incentives for contractors to 
performance, and provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with the 
information necessary to prevent future rip-offs. Our bill would make 
several key reforms to achieve those goals.
  First, our bill would ensure competitive and transparent pricing by 
closing a loophole and ensuring that defense contractors provide the 
federal government cost or pricing information in all cases where there 
isn&#x27;t adequate price competition that results in at least 2 competitive 
bids. Second, the bill would restore market dynamics and ensure that 
commercial goods are those actually sold to customers other than just 
the federal government, revising the definition of commercial item for 
federal procurement by the Department of Defense. Third, the bill would 
ensure payment is tied to performance by creating a new pilot program 
for progress payments, which will help to tie payments to performance 
by providing contractors the opportunity to receive advance payments 
only when they meet certain conditions such as providing timely 
responses, disclosing important data, and meeting small business 
subcontractor goals. Lastly, the bill would ensure that our defense 
dollars are being spent to provide our armed forces with the resources 
they need and not to line the pockets of defense contractor executives, 
requiring disclosures from defense contractors mirroring those already 
required by publicly traded companies.
  Taken together, this bill will be an important step in tackling price 
gouging, overbilling, or outright fraud by defense contractors. As a 
senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I know how much we 
pay for parts to keep military equipment ready. We know

[[Page E639]]

that taxpayers are routinely overcharged due to loopholes in current 
law and federal procurement regulations. We cannot allow taxpayer money 
to be wasted to inflate the bottom lines of multinational defense 
contractors. Our service members need the tools to properly negotiate 
prices. This is just common sense, and that&#x27;s why we are reintroducing 
this bill today.
  Mr. Speaker, Representative DeLuzio and I look forward to working 
across the aisle to advance these key reforms in the ``Stop Pentagon 
Price Gouging Act.&#x27;&#x27; I encourage all members to join us in cosponsoring 
this commonsense bill.

        RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MUENSTER STATE BANK

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, July 6, 2023

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Muenster State 
Bank on their 100th Anniversary, celebrating their opening to serve 
North Texans on July 2, 1923.
  Early in 1923, a group of local leaders from the small German 
Catholic community of Muenster, Texas decided that if the town of less 
than 450 residents was going to continue to grow and prosper, a bank 
was necessary. This group, made up of businessmen and farmers, met in 
J.W. Meurer&#x27;s hardware store to request that J.W. take on a leadership 
role in the formation of this new bank. The group was apprehensive that 
the required funds could be raised to supply the necessary capital and 
deposits, considering that the previous private bank had already failed 
twice. Assured that adequate stock could be sold, the group prevailed 
upon Mr. Meurer to continue in his leadership role and to take charge 
of the organization and operation of the bank. They looked for 
additional assistance and discovered through interviews that 
experienced bankers could be found but were unaffordable for this new 
bank venture.
  Mr. Meurer knew his brother-in-law, J.M. Weinzapfel, had the business 
acumen required and was available, but at the time lived over 60 miles 
away in Windthorst, Texas. Upon being offered the job, Mr. Weinzapfel 
moved to Muenster to assist with the necessary paperwork to secure a 
charter and future operations. The original 21 stockholders in the bank 
successfully raised $19,250.00 in total capital to obtain the State 
Charter and on Friday, June 29, 1923, the State of Texas granted them 
Bank Charter No. 1400. On the following Monday of July 2, 1923, the 
bank opened for business, providing Mr. Weinzapfel the foundation and 
community from which he would devote the remainder of his business 
life.
  In the early years growth was slow. Nonetheless, the bank has 
generated an annual profit since inception, and has paid dividends in 
all but 2 years. Over the past century, through good and bad economic 
times, periods of war, and uncertainty such as 2 robberies and 1 
attempted robbery, the officers and staff persevered, ensuring 
continued growth and prosperity along with the community it served. As 
a combination of a century&#x27;s dedication and hard work by bank staff 
members and the loyalty and confidence customers have placed in the 
institution, Muenster State Bank has grown to $213 million in total 
assets as of the end of 2022, generating $3.5 million in net income and 
paying out $2.1 million in shareholder distributions.
  Recently, Muenster State Bank&#x27;s current president, Robert Weinzapfel, 
read the following communication to today&#x27;s shareholders that then bank 
president, J.M. Weinzapfel, had written in 1942. Despite being written 
81 years ago, it still rings true today.
  ``The bank organized and opened July 2nd, 1923 and never failed to 
pay a regular dividend each year since then. The Officers and Directors 
have been faithful to their trust and were influential in the promotion 
and development of many enterprising and successful business 
institutions in Muenster.
  Our record of unusual service rendered to our patrons city, 
community, state and nation is reflected in the bank&#x27;s growth. With 
resources now near \1/2\ million dollars, we believe that the plan to 
increase the capital is in keeping with the sound and conservative 
policy that has characterized the bank throughout its history.
  The achievements enumerated are an expressed tribute and reflect in 
memory to the untiring efforts and fidelity of the original officers, 
directors, stockholders and patrons that are still with us and those 
who have passed on to their reward.&#x27;&#x27;
  As a part of our independent banking system, Muenster State Bank is a 
special part of our U.S. community banking system that is committed to 
supporting and investing to serve their local communities. I join the 
Muenster State Bank Stakeholders in looking back on the past century of 
community service, celebrating their accomplishments, and looking 
forward to the trust, community, and financial security they will 
continue to provide into their next century of operations.

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, July 6, 2023

  Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to look 
back on Gun Violence Prevention Month. During this time of mourning and 
remembrance, I have had near constant nightmarish images in mind. 
Images of human carnage in the aftermath of shootings involving 
military-style assault weapons like the ones we now witness on a 
regular, predictable basis.
  Families are unable to simply run errands on the weekends or interact 
with their neighbors without fear of losing their lives.
  And yet, most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
tolerate this uniquely American carnage without hesitation.
  We know that the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban was effective at reducing 
crime and getting these military-style weapons off our streets.
  And we know that after the ban was dropped, between 2015 and 2022, 
mass shootings where an assault weapon was used accounted for a third 
of all mass shooting deaths and more than 80 percent of all injuries.
  AR-15s and other assault weapons are the tool of choice by gunmen in 
nearly all of the 10 deadliest mass shootings since 2015, including the 
gunman in Uvalde, Texas, who shot and killed 19 children and 2 teachers 
in their elementary school.
  This is a crisis of law and order. We must return safety to our 
streets.
  Gun violence leaves a mark on each individual and community it 
impacts, and it spares none of our constituents. It also spares none of 
our minds these days as we await news of the next atrocity.
  May we find the political courage to do better for you. For our brave 
first responders and law enforcement officers. For our kids. For our 
devastated communities across this nation.
  By using our power as legislators, we can create a safer society 
where individuals can exercise their rights responsibly, while also 
curbing the senseless loss of innocent lives. It&#x27;s time to prioritize 
human lives over political divisions and enact the change that our 
communities so desperately need.

                     REFLECTING ON PRIDE MONTH 2023

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. HALEY M. STEVENS

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, July 6, 2023

  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, last month, I joined my Equality Caucus 
colleagues in recognizing Pride Month--an opportunity to honor the 
LGBTQ+ community, celebrate the developments we have made, and 
acknowledge the work that has yet to be done.
  We have made remarkable progress towards full equality since LGBTQ+ 
patrons fought back against discrimination and police harassment at the 
Stonewall Inn in June of 1969.
  Acceptance of this community has reached important heights, marriage 
equality is the law of the land, and the Supreme Court has made clear 
that workers cannot be fired because of their sexual orientation or 
gender identity.
  Since entering Congress, I have had the distinct privilege of voting 
to pass the Equality Act to prohibit discrimination, the NO HATE Act to 
respond to hate crimes, the Global Respect Act to deny visas to those 
who commit human rights abuses against LGBTQ+ folks, and much more.
  As a lifelong friend of the LGBTQ+ community and a Member of Congress 
committed to the pursuit of global tolerance, I know we still have so 
much work to do.
  Hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in the states in 
recent legislative sessions, and many have been signed into law. Many 
of these laws target young people, and especially trans and nonbinary 
youth.
  Furthermore, I have been disgusted and infuriated by comments that I 
have heard from some of my colleagues across the aisle on the House 
Education and Workforce Committee during recent activity--those who 
wish to delegitimize the gender identities of our youth and strip 
LGBTQ+ students of their rights, resources, and humanity.
  Our kids are suffering, and I will not stand for it.
  To everyone in this beautiful community: know that I see you, I love 
you, and we have a big circle over here on Capitol Hill that will never 
let intolerance--even and especially in the highest levels of 
government--go unchallenged.
  Too many of our LGBTQ+ family, friends, coworkers, and loved ones 
face discrimination every day, all across the nation. Continuing to 
pass pro-equality legislation sends a powerful message to members of 
the LGBTQ+ community that they are not second-class citizens.
  Every human deserves to live as their most authentic self, and every 
American requires equal treatment under the law.
  You deserve to feel safe when on public transportation, in the 
workplace, in the doctor&#x27;s office, and in the classroom. No exceptions.
  Going forward from this year&#x27;s pride month, I will continue the fight 
to ensure that LGBTQ+ Americans are safe, secure, and free from 
discrimination.

                RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL DARYL BOHAC

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. DON BACON

                              of nebraska

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, July 6, 2023

  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major General Daryl 
Bohac, the Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard, on the 
occasion of his retirement after serving in this position since July of 
2013 and as an Air Force officer for 35 years. As the Adjutant General, 
he is the senior military officer for the more than 4,500 Army and Air 
National Guard personnel serving in the state of Nebraska and during 
his tenure, the Nebraska National Guard deployed over 1,300 Soldiers 
and over 2,000 Airmen for worldwide combat and peacekeeping missions.
  General Bohac is a visionary leader who successfully garnered more 
than $45 million to modernize and enhance the National Guard in 
Nebraska to meet and sustain future requirements by constructing a new 
vehicle maintenance facility in North Platte, Nebraska, a new multi-
mission Readiness Center in Bellevue,

Nebraska, and new barracks in Mead, Nebraska.
  General Bohac and the Nebraska National Guard&#x27;s disaster response 
capabilities were tested most notably when a state of emergency was 
declared following a ``bomb cyclone&#x27;&#x27; that hit the state in March of 
2019, causing severe blizzard conditions in the western panhandle with 
extreme thunderstorms and historic flooding in the east. More than 450 
Nebraska National Guard Soldiers and Airmen executed 113 flood-related 
missions, the most significant disaster response operation in state 
history. In the wake of the 2019 historic floods, he successfully 
advocated for more than $43 million in funding to rapidly reconstruct 
the decimated facilities at Camp Ashland in record time, while also 
rebuilding the levee to be more robust and resilient to future floods.
  On the heels of this historic disaster, the Nebraska National Guard 
was called upon to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic and response. The 
National Guard partnered with the University of Nebraska Medical Center 
in providing Camp Ashland facilities as an initial housing location for 
57 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China. Further, Major General Bohac 
worked with the Governor, the Department of Health and Human Services, 
and other state agencies to set up a State Emergency Operations Center 
to coordinate and manage COVID-19 emergency actions in Nebraska, 
directing Soldiers, Airmen, and Emergency Management civilians in 
response planning, mobile testing teams, personal protective equipment 
distribution, food bank support, and housing accommodations.
  I thank General Bohac for his many years of sacrifice and service to 
our Nation and the state of Nebraska. We owe him a debt of gratitude we 
can never repay for his impactful leadership and achievements that will 
be felt for many future generations.
