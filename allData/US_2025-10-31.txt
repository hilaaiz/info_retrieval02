I rise today to recognize and honor two 
of my remarkable constituents of Pennsylvanias 1st Congressional 
District, Dipesh and Dipti Pandya, as they celebrate their 30th wedding 
anniversary.
  On this joyous occasion, we celebrate not only thirty years of 
marriage, but thirty years of partnership, commitment, and steadfast 
love. Dipesh and Diptis marriage is a profound example of what it 
means to build a life rooted

in respect, compassion, and shared purpose. Over three decades, they 
faced challenges with grace, celebrated triumphs with gratitude, and 
walked side-by-side through every season of life.
  Dipesh and Dipti are the embodiment of the American story. They are 
dedicated parents, faithful friends, and generous members of our 
community. Their unwavering work ethic and perseverance reflect values 
that have strengthened both their family and those around them. Through 
their kindness, hospitality, and warmth of spirit, they have touched 
countless lives.
  Together they have built a home filled with love, laughter, and 
understanding. Their marriage stands as a testament to the enduring 
power of devotion, communication, and, above all, unconditional love. 
They are living proof that the most meaningful legacy we leave is not 
measured in material achievements, but in the love we share and the 
lives we uplift.
  As they celebrate this incredible milestone surrounded by family, 
friends, and loved ones, we honor their commitment to one another and 
to the values that make our community strong. May the next chapter of 
their journey be blessed with continued health, happiness, and 
cherished memories.
, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives 
and the people of Pennsylvanias 1st District, I extend my warmest 
congratulations to Dipesh and Dipti Pandya on their 30th wedding 
anniversary. May their love continue to inspire all of us.
I rise today to celebrate the 
public service of Courtney Fry, who is departing Capitol Hill after 
almost 19 years with the House of Representatives.
2007 when she started working as a staff 
assistant in the office of then-Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Her 
competence, hard work, and dedication led to a 16-year career in that 
office, where she worked her way up to Director of Legislative 
Operations.
  She then continued her service with the office of House Democratic 
Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, where she has worked for almost three 
years as Director of Member Services. In this capacity, she has been a 
tireless servant to all members of the House Democratic Caucus, 
providing advice, guidance, and resources. Ms. Fry has not only been an 
invaluable partner to my office and my staff--she also became a friend.
  I thank Ms. Fry for her countless contributions to the Caucus. She 
will certainly be missed here on Capitol Hill, and I wish her great 
success as she moves on to the next chapter of her career.
I rise today to honor Grace 
Episcopal Church for the organizations 150 years of dedicated service 
and commitment to the people of our community.
  Grace Episcopal Church was founded in 1875 in St. Helena and remains 
the oldest stone church in Napa County. Episcopal worship in St. Helena 
began in 1871, when a small group of parishioners gathered as a 
fledgling congregation. Their efforts culminated on December 12, 1875, 
when Bishop A.W.D. Wingfield consecrated the newly built church and 
confirmed fourteen founding members. In 1882, the congregation 
constructed the stone sanctuary at the corner of Oak and Spring 
Streets, where the church continues to stand today. What began as a 
small congregation without a permanent home grew into a mission and, in 
1954, achieved full parish status. For nearly a century and a half, 
generations of families have sustained Grace Episcopal Church as a 
place of worship, service, and community life in our town.
  Grace Episcopal Churchs deep commitment to our community is 
reflected in its long history of service and outreach. For more than a 
century, the church has been a place of refuge and fellowship for the 
people of our St. Helena. Since 1975, Grace Church has hosted ``Joes 
Group, the oldest Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in St. Helena, 
continuing its tradition of providing support in times of need. Grace 
Churchs ``Common Table program provides free community meals twice a 
month, offering nourishment and connection to all who attend. The 
churchs community involvement also extends to youth development, with 
the Reverend Irving Baxter founding Troop One St. Helena Boy Scouts at 
Grace Church in 1920, just twelve years after the scouting movement 
began in the United Kingdom.
  Grace Church has been recognized for its steadfast response to 
community needs during times of crisis. It serves as the Red Cross hub 
for our northern Napa County community, offering disaster relief and 
shelter when disaster strikes. During recent wildfires, the church 
distributed more than $10,000 in assistance to low-income families who 
were displaced. During the pandemic, the Napa Valley New Deal was 
founded at Grace Church to provide free food, supplies, and prepared 
meals to vulnerable residents throughout our region. The church 
continues to partner with faith-based organizations to provide 
essential goods, collecting and distributing food staples to families 
in need.
  Grace Churchs dedication to service also extends to affordable 
housing advocacy and spiritual wellness. Its participation in the 
Adopt-a-Family program for more than 20 years has brought comfort and 
stability to families during the holidays. Its ongoing advocacy for 
affordable housing has helped secure homes for more than 30 low-income 
families. In 1997, the parish committed to tithing 10 percent of its 
income to support work beyond its walls, producing a lasting impact 
locally and around the globe. In 2015, the church built and dedicated a 
community labyrinth modeled after the Chartres Cathedral labyrinth to 
serve as a public space for meditation and spiritual reflection. 
Periodic Taize services continue this spirit of inclusion, offering 
ecumenical worship dedicated to Christian unity.
, we thank Grace Episcopal Church for its dedication and 
service to our community. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor them here today on their 150th anniversary.
I rise today to honor Judy 
Ahmann, who has been named the 2025 Member of the Year by the Napa 
County Farm Bureau. Judy is being recognized for her decades of 
advocacy for agriculture and her enduring commitment to the Farm Bureau 
and our Napa Countys agricultural community.
, Nebraska, and later moved with her 
family to Long Beach, California. She attended Long Beach State 
College, graduating in 1966, a year after marrying her husband, John. 
Judy began her professional career at IBM, but her passion for the land 
soon led her and John to purchase their first 12 acres in California. 
After a brief relocation to New Jersey for work, they returned to 
California in 1970 and settled in our Napa County, where they purchased 
300 acres and began raising cattle. In 1986, they acquired more than 
3,000 acres along Lake Berryessa, establishing Running Deer Ranch. With 
no prior ranching experience, the Ahmanns turned to the Napa County 
Farm Bureau and local Cattlewomens and Cattlemens Associations for 
guidance so they could raise their three daughters, Christina, Anna, 
and Erica, in the ranching tradition.
She became a long-standing member and 
leader in California CattleWomen, serving as president at both the 
local and state levels, including as state president in 2007 and 2008. 
She later joined the Executive Board of American National CattleWomen, 
where her leadership earned her recognition as National CattleWoman of 
the Year in 2014. In 2010, Judy was selected as a member of Common 
Threads California, which honors women for their volunteer leadership 
and contributions to agriculture.
  Judy has rightfully been recognized for her advocacy at the national 
level. In 2013, she testified before the House Natural Resources 
Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation in support of 
the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. Her 
testimony focused on the need to balance conservation efforts with the 
preservation of working ranchlands and grazing operations for future 
generations.
She and her family have been 
generous supporters of youth in agriculture, donating time and raising 
funds for scholarships benefiting local 4-H and Future Farmers of 
America students. She has been a steadfast supporter of the Napa County 
Farm Bureau, actively promoting agricultural policy, education, and 
community engagement. In 2010, Judy and John placed a conservation 
easement on 1,275 acres of Running Deer Ranch through the California 
Rangeland Trust, permanently protecting the ranch as a working 
landscape while preserving its vital wildlife habitat. They also 
granted a trail easement to open public access to 9,100 acres of Bureau 
of Land Management land that had been landlocked for more than 150 
years.

  Judy remains deeply involved in ranching alongside her daughters and 
their families, who now operate Running Deer Ranch. Despite the 
devastation caused by wildfires in 2018 and 2020, the Ahmann family has 
continued to rebuild, demonstrating resilience and an unwavering 
commitment to sustainable ranching and responsible land management.
, we thank Judy Ahmann for her decades of leadership in 
the cattle industry, dedication to agricultural education and advocacy, 
and commitment to supporting the next generation of farmers. Therefore, 
it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today as the Napa 
County Farm Bureaus 2025 Member of the Year.

including as President and Director of the Volunteer Program. She has 
also been active in the American Business Womens Association and the

community service. While Maries priorities have always centered on her 
family, including her three daughters and grandchildren, she has never 
wavered in her dedication to her friends, neighbors, and the well-being

SARTs advocacy and case management programs have expanded to provide 
comprehensive, survivor-centered care for thousands affected by sexual 
assault, domestic violence, and human trafficking. She has built an 
organization grounded in compassion and respect, ensuring that every 
survivor is met with dignity and the support needed to rebuild their 
life. One of Melissas most significant contributions has been her 
leadership in the regional response to human trafficking. She has 
spearheaded collaborations with local law enforcement, county task 
forces, and community partners to create a coordinated and effective 
safety net for trafficking survivors. Her efforts have led to the 
development of a 24/7 human trafficking crisis line, the expansion of 
emergency housing options, and the implementation of long-term recovery 
pathways that address both immediate and systemic barriers to healing. 
Melissa has also been a tireless advocate and educator. She engages in 
civic organizations, professional groups, and schools to raise 
awareness about exploitation, victim rights, and prevention. Her 
outreach to youth is particularly impactful and through school 
presentations and youth programs, she has equipped young people with 
the knowledge and confidence to recognize and resist the signs of 
trafficking and abuse. Survivors and colleagues alike describe Melissa 
as a beacon of hope and a steady, empathetic presence in moments of 
crisis. Her courage, compassion, and tireless advocacy for survivors

far beyond leadership training. Its programs provide parenting classes, 
mental health support, and resources for survivors of domestic 
violence, while also offering small business training and access to

I rise today to recognize Saratoga County 
District Attorney Karen Heggen for her decades of service, leadership, 
and commitment to justice in her home community.
  A Malta native, DA Karen Heggen has served in the Saratoga County 
District Attorneys Office since 1993, beginning her career as an 
Assistant District Attorney and advancing through the ranks to the 
offices second-highest position before being elected District Attorney 
in 2014. Over more than thirty years, she has dedicated herself to 
protecting the people of Saratoga County with professionalism, 
compassion, and integrity.
  As the first woman ever elected District Attorney in Saratoga County, 
Karen made history while setting a standard of excellence that inspired 
those who followed. Her tenure as DA was marked by both achievement and 
resilience during a time of significant change in New Yorks criminal 
justice system. Under her leadership, the office maintained one of the 
states strongest records for case integrity and public trust despite 
the challenges of bail reform, discovery reform, and parole reform. Her

plagued many other jurisdictions.
  Throughout her career, Karen focused not on politics or recognition, 
but on people. She emphasized teamwork, collaboration, and justice

right--to balance the interests of victims, public safety, and the

I rise today to recognize Saratoga County 
Sheriff Michael Zurlo, a lifelong resident of Saratoga County who has 
dedicated his career to keeping our communities safe, strong, and 
connected.
  Elected Sheriff on November 5, 2013, Sheriff Zurlo brought decades of 
hands-on experience to the office, having served as a deputy, sergeant,

the countys emergency communications system to improve coordination 
among first responders. He also built partnerships with local, state, 
and federal law enforcement agencies to better combat crime and support 
shared missions.
  Sheriff Zurlo has also demonstrated a strong commitment to innovation 
and compassion. He implemented stricter penalties for those charged 
with driving while intoxicated, launched the ``Blue Envelope program 
to assist drivers on the autism spectrum during traffic stops, and 
oversaw the opening of the countys $20 million Paul E. Lent Public 
Safety Facility. Under his leadership, the Sheriffs Office introduced

individuals struggling with addiction, offering accountability, 
rehabilitation, and a path forward.

I rise today to honor the life and enduring 
legacy of Lasmockie Octavia Fountain, who tragically lost her life to 
domestic violence on May 23, 2015. This year marks the 10th anniversary 
of her passing, and in that decade, her memory has ignited a movement 
that continues to bring awareness, healing, and advocacy to families 
affected by domestic violence in Georgia and across the nation.
  Born on April 4, 1985, Lasmockie was the beloved daughter of 
Stephanie Fountain Burton and Charles Nixon, and a devoted mother to 
four children: Solano Fountain, Sole Fountain, Shannon Fountain, and 
London Fountain. Her life was full of promise, and her sudden loss at 
the age of 30 left an unfillable void in the hearts of her family and 
community.
  In response to this tragedy, Lasmockies aunt, Dr. Sharon Lynn 
Fountain Stafford, founded the organization: A Voice for Lasmockie/
Lasmockies L.O.A.D. (Loved Ones Against Domestic Violence). This 
organization has worked tirelessly to ensure that Lasmockies story is 
not forgotten--transforming grief into advocacy and education for 
others impacted by domestic violence. Among its many community 
initiatives, the organization hosts the annual Domestic Violence 
Awareness Walk on the last Saturday in October, uniting survivors, 
families, advocates, and community members in remembrance and in 
action. Additionally, ``Lasmockie Day is observed on October 23rd in 
Macon, Georgia, honoring her legacy with community outreach and 
education.
  A Tree of Hope has been planted in Macon, GA--a deeply meaningful 
location as it was the home of Lasmockies grandparents, the late 
Willie Frank Fountain, Sr. and Syella Fountain, and is also the 
location where Lasmockies life was tragically taken. The tree bears 
the names of individuals lost to domestic violence and stands as a 
living memorial--a symbol that their lives mattered, that they are not 
forgotten, and that their stories continue to inspire change. A 
memorial bench featuring a mural of Lasmockie was also placed at the 
site, creating a space for reflection, healing, and remembrance.
  Additionally, ``Purple Light Day is observed annually on October 
26th in Macon. Initiated by Dr. Stafford, Purple Light Day encourages 
homes, businesses, and public spaces to be illuminated in purple--the 
color representing domestic violence awareness as a visual show of 
support for victims and a call to action for prevention.
  Lasmockies legacy continues to live on through her children, family, 
and loved ones, including her aunt, Dr. Sharon Lynn Fountain Stafford, 
who have taken up the fight against domestic violence. They work 
tirelessly to honor Lasmockies memory through advocacy, education, and 
outreach. Together, they actively lead the work of A Voice for 
Lasmockie/Lasmockies L.O.A.D., focusing on empowering underserved 
communities where domestic violence is often underreported and support 
is limited.
, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join my wife, Vivian, and me, as well as the people of Georgias 2nd 
District, in honoring the life and ongoing impact of Lasmockie Octavia 
Fountain and the work of A Voice for Lasmockie/Lasmockies L.O.A.D. on 
the 10th anniversary of her passing. May her memory continue to be a 
beacon of hope, and may her story inspire continued action to end 
domestic violence.
I rise today in memory of Anthony ``Tony 
Anello, who passed away at the age of 77 on September 28, 2025. Tony 
was a beloved and celebrated member of Bodega Bay, a renowned 
fisherman, and a pillar of this coastal community.
  Born in San Francisco, California in 1948, Tony was raised in 
Guerneville, California. Tony was a rodeo calf roper when he married 
Carol Zucca, his wife of 58 years. To support their growing family, 
Tony began an excavation business, while earning additional income as a 
fisherman and selling produce.
  In 1968, Tony joined the Guerneville Fire Department as a volunteer, 
launching his steadfast career as a firefighter and EMT. He served the 
Sonoma County fire departments for decades and rose through the ranks 
of captain, training officer, and battalion chief during his tenure. 
Tonys excellence and commitment as a training officer is credited for 
shaping generations of paramedics and firefighters in Sonoma County.
  Most notably, Tony had a deep-rooted love for fishing. The grandson 
of a Sicilian fisherman, Tony purchased his first of many commercial 
fishing boats in 1969. On his days off from the fire department, Tony 
would go commercial salmon and crab fishing.
  In 2004, Tony and Carol founded Spud Point Crab Co. in Bodega Bay, a 
small harbor stand that grew to become an iconic, homestyle restaurant 
for both tourists and locals. Tony and his son, Mark, provided seasonal 
crab and wild king salmon fresh from the dock of the marina across from 
the restaurant. The waterfront stand, inspired by Old Fishermans Wharf 
in San Francisco, still attracts lines of customers seeking Carols 
prize-winning clam chowder and Tonys Dungeness crab. A beacon of the 
community, Spud Point Co. is a critical hub for the town and a 
charitable supporter of many local organizations.
  Along with his well-respected work ethic, Tony was well known for his 
larger-than-life character, humor, and generous spirit. Tony was a 
stalwart advocate for the local fishing community and hosted many vital 
community gatherings to preserve the future of the fishing industry at 
Bodega Bay. While he will be greatly missed, Tonys legacy will live on 
through the innumerable positive impacts he has had on his community. 
Tony is survived by his wife and their four children, Lori, Gina, Lisa, 
and Mark, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, many of whom have 
carried on his passion for fishing and firefighting.
, I respectfully ask that you join me in extending 
condolences to Tonys family and many friends and in expressing deep 
appreciation for his decades of service to his community.
I rise today to honor and celebrate the 
beautiful life, legacy, and memory of my Constituent Susan L. 
Zolotorofe who was a cherished daughter, a treasured friend, and a 
beloved member of our Bucks County community. Susan passed away on 
October 24, 2025, at her home in Ivyland, Pennsylvania, at the age of 
53, after courageously enduring complications stemming from radiation 
treatments she underwent as a teenager to overcome a brain tumor. Her 
life is a testament to courage, perseverance, and a heart overflowing 
with love.
  Born on August 17, 1972, at Abington Hospital, Susan entered this 
world with a radiant smile. Her smile would go on to warm the hearts of 
everyone privileged enough to know her. From her early years, Susan 
possessed a gentleness of spirit that enriched the lives of all who 
crossed her path.
  Susan dedicated her life to helping children grow, learn, and feel 
seen. She spent many years working in preschools and day care centers 
across Bucks County, including her service at the YMCA in Warminster. 
For Susan, child care was not merely a profession but a calling. She 
believed that every child deserved compassion, patience, and 
encouragement, and she gave those gifts freely. Her kindness was not 
loud but was quiet, steady, and deeply felt.
  For over twenty years, Susan faithfully served at Addisville Church, 
assisting with Sunday School and Vacation Bible School alongside her 
devoted mother. Her work within the church reflected her strong faith 
and the values she lived each day. The values of care, humility, 
service, and love.
  Some of Susans happiest moments were spent near the water. From her 
childhood visits to Silver Bay on Lake George, New York, to cherished 
days walking the beaches of Ocean City, New Jersey, these places 
offered her peace and filled her with wonder. They were her 
sanctuaries, where the world slowed enough for her heart to feel light.
  Though she was strikingly tall and beautiful, it was her smile, a 
smile that was warm, gentle, and unmistakably genuine that defined her. 
Even during her most difficult medical challenges, that smile remained. 
It was a symbol of her resilience, her faith, and her refusal to let 
hardship dim her spirit.
  Susan is survived by her loving parents, Eileen (nee Fetter) and Don 
Zolotorofe, along with a large, devoted family and a circle of friends 
who will forever hold her memory close. Each carries with them the 
profound imprint of her kindness and the example of how to live with 
grace.
, the true measure of a life is not found in what we 
accumulate, but in the hearts we touch. By that measure, Susan lived a 
life overflowing with purpose and love. She showed us what it means to 
persevere with dignity, to care without condition, and to walk through 
this world with a smile that reminds others they matter.
  May her memory be a blessing, and may we honor her legacy by living 
as she did, with compassion, faith, and joy.
  It is my pleasure to honor her in the United States Congress, so that 
future generations may know of the extraordinary kindness and courage 
of Susan L. Zolotorofe, a woman whose light continues to shine.
