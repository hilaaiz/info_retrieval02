            CELEBRATING THE 2024 UCLA MEN&#x27;S VOLLEYBALL TEAM

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. TED LIEU

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 17, 2024

  Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the men&#x27;s volleyball 
team from the University of California, Los Angeles. They took home the 
2024 NCAA Men&#x27;s National Collegiate Volleyball Championship on the 4th 
of May. UCLA defeated the men&#x27;s volleyball team from the California 
State University, Long Beach at Walter Pyramid on the campus of Long 
Beach State in Long Beach, California.
  This year&#x27;s championship brought home the team&#x27;s 21st national title 
win, cementing their record as the winningest program in NCAA history. 
The win marks UCLA&#x27;s 122nd overall NCAA title across all sports. These 
are truly remarkable achievements.
  The men&#x27;s volleyball team should be proud of their achievement in 
earning the distinction of being back-to-back national champions, 
amongst the more than half a million student-athletes who participate 
in NCAA events each year. With guidance from Coach John Speraw, who 
secured his fifth NCAA men&#x27;s volleyball title as a collegiate head 
coach, UCLA ended their season with wins in 15 out of their last 16 
matches.
  I would like to sincerely congratulate the UCLA&#x27;s men&#x27;s volleyball 
team once again on winning its second consecutive national championship 
and wish them the best of luck next season. This win is a special 
moment in the collegiate athletic careers of each player and marks an 
exceptional accomplishment and historical achievement for the UCLA 
community. Go Bruins. U-C-L-A. Fight. Fight. Fight.

                          ____________________

    HONORING THE 170TH ANNIVERSARY OF SHILOH BAPTIST CHURCH OLD SITE

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER

                          Friday, May 17, 2024

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate 
Shiloh Baptist Church Old Site on 170 years of service to the 
community.

[[Page E524]]

  This remarkable milestone is a testament to the thousands of 
congregants who, through their unwavering faith and love for their 
neighbors, have helped build a legacy of service at the church.
  For 170 years, Shiloh Old Site has been an advocate for justice, 
equality, and perseverance. Throughout the years, this community has 
been a catalyst in halting the spread of racial injustice in the city 
of Fredericksburg and has worked tirelessly to provide supplemental 
education to Black residents to offset the shortfalls of a racially 
segregated educational system. Through its ministries and its purpose-
driven youth mission, the church works to provide families and children 
with programming that nurtures a community service mindset.
  Shiloh Old Site is a pillar of the Fredericksburg community--always 
ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. The community&#x27;s 
commitment to Fredericksburg and its residents is both inspiring and 
humbling.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating and 
thanking Shiloh Baptist Church Old Site on 170 years of dedicated 
service to the Fredericksburg community. I look forward to celebrating 
their continued success and contributions to Virginia in years to come.

  RECOGNIZING BERNIE RICKE&#x27;S LEADERSHIP OF UAW LOCAL 600 IN DEARBORN, 
                                MICHIGAN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 17, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bernie Ricke, 
President of UAW Local 600 in Dearborn, Michigan, on the occasion of 
his retirement. His dedication to the UAW over the last 51 years, and 
his leadership of Local 600 for the past 15 years, is worthy of 
commendation.
  UAW Local 600 currently has over 30,000 active and retired members, 
representing a diverse membership from the Ford Rouge Complex, AK 
Steel, truck drivers, independent part suppliers, as well as healthcare 
and technical office professionals. They currently have over 47 
autonomous bargaining units throughout Southeastern Michigan.
  Bernie was born into the auto industry as the son of an engineer who 
worked at Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler. At the age of 18, Bernie 
took a job in a Ford warehouse and shortly thereafter joined the UAW as 
a member of Local 600 in November of 1973. He quickly took on more 
roles within the union, holding positions of Financial Secretary, 
District Committee-person, Bargaining Committee-person, and Vice 
President of the Parts Depot Unit. From 1997 he served as the Second 
and First Vice President of Local 600 before being elected President in 
2009. His leadership over the last 15 years has earned him the respect 
of not only local leaders but national leaders as well. UAW VP Chuck 
Browning said about Bernie ``He&#x27;s unselfish, He&#x27;s humble. And he&#x27;s a 
really powerful presence in our union.&#x27;&#x27; Rory Gamble, the former 
president of the UAW, said ``Bernie&#x27;s leadership legacy will fare well 
over the years as historians look back at his impact on the UAW and 
Ford. He was steady, fair, and successful for members in the worst of 
times. If the measure of a man is the dignity he brings to others, he 
will always be a giant in our union.&#x27;&#x27;
  Bernie and I got to know each other through the many community 
projects that he has dedicated himself to. Outside of his work with the 
UAW, Bernie and his wife, Sue, are pillars of the Detroit community. 
Together they run the Bernie Ricke Charity Fund out of Trenton, MI. 
Bernie is a lifetime member of the NAACP, member of the Labor Advisory 
Board for Health Alliance Plan, and serves as the Chairman of the Board 
of Directors for Bridging Communities Incorporated. Bridging 
Communities is a non-profit organization that serves the community of 
Southwest Detroit by providing a variety of services to the homebound 
elderly including meals on wheels, minor home repairs, transportation 
for doctors&#x27; appointments and medical care. In 1999 and again in 2004, 
Bernie was given the ``Spirit of Detroit&#x27;&#x27; award by the Detroit City 
Council.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bernie Ricke 
for all that he has done for the people of Southeastern Michigan. 
Together we have been through the thick and thin of life, surviving the 
tough times by breaking bread at his famous garage parties. We wish him 
all best in retirement, though we know he will still be working hard to 
support the UAW and his Detroit community in whatever ways he can. I 
thank Bernie.

                      RECOGNIZING BORICUA COLLEGE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 17, 2024

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Boricua College 
on the special occasion of its 50th aniversary and in appreciation for 
decades of higher education. Boricua College was the first private, 
not-for-profit post-secondary educational institution established in 
the United States specifically designed to meet the academic needs of 
Puerto Ricans and other Spanish-speaking people. Today, it is a diverse 
institution for learning and professional development.
  Boricua College inspired educated and passionate advocates for the 
Puerto Rican Disapora during the 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s in New York City. 
Visionaries like Dr. Antonia Pantoja, founder of Universidad Boricua 
and the precursor of Boricua College, founded by Dr. Victor Alicea, 
believed that higher education and cultural pride were crucial to 
addressing poverty and creating economic empowerment. The significant 
migration of Puerto Ricans to New York City warranted a grassroots 
response to navigate the socio-economic opportunities and challenges of 
plantando bandera in a new environment. Thus, Boricua College was 
created and became a beacon of hope for the Latino community in 
Brooklyn.
  Since its founding in 1974, Boricua College has grown from its humble 
beginnings on a single-floor storefront in Williamsburg to a multi-
campus institution spanning Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. The 
first Boricua College class had just 26 students. When it opened its 
doors, it broke all barriers to higher learning with a cadre of Puerto 
Rican bilingual professionals in New York City. Today, Boricua College 
has an enrollment of thousands of students pursuing an Associate, 
Bachelor or Master&#x27;s degree in the field of Human Services, Business, 
Liberal Arts, Childhood Education and inter-American Studies to list a 
few. It is also a designated Hispanic Serving Institution by the U.S. 
Department of Education.
  The growth of Boricua College exemplifies the growth of Latinos&#x27; 
economic and political empowerment across the country. The college may 
not have millions in endowments, if at all. However, it does have an 
unwavering commitment to educational advancement. By 2060, nearly 1 in 
4 Americans are likely to be Latinos&#x27;. Thanks to vital institutions 
like Boricua College, we are making even greater contributions in every 
sector of society--education, politics, business, the arts, and 
sciences.
  This fine institution is as successful as the administration and 
leadership. Therefore, I would also like to salute Founder and 
President Dr. Victor G. Alicea for a lifetime of public service, Board 
of Trustees Chair Benito R. Fernandez, the deans, faculty, staff, and 
graduates. Mr. Speaker, please join us in recognizing Boricua College 
on the occasion of its 50th anniversary and offering our best wishes 
for another 50 years of serving the community.

at my home church, Walnut Valley Baptist in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
  David and his wife, Aamie, who serves as a family counselor, are dear 
friends of mine who have a heart for sharing the gospel and ministering 
not only inside the church building but in the community with 
individuals wherever there is a need.
  David and Aamie have been faithful servants and leaders for many 
years. It was a pleasure to host them in D.C. this week.
  I, along with others in Arkansas&#x27; Fourth Congressional District, are 
grateful to Pastor Mason and his wife Aamie for their servant hearts 
and their obedience in serving God.
