  CELEBRATING A CENTURY OF SUCCESS AS CREIGHTON BROTHERS LLC TURNS 100

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RUDY YAKYM III

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 1, 2025

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable 
milestone for a family-run business that has been a cornerstone of 
Indiana agriculture for a century, Creighton Brothers LLC.
  This year, Creighton Brothers is celebrating 100 years in business, a 
legacy that began in 1925 when Hobart and Russell Creighton started a 
modest egg operation with just 2,500 hens.
  Over the last century, this operation has grown into one of the most 
respected and vertically integrated egg producers in the country, with 
more than 3 million laying hens, feed production on 10,000 acres of 
farmland, and distribution to customers nationwide.
  What makes this story truly special isn&#x27;t just the scale of their 
growth, but the fact that

Creighton Brothers is still proudly family-owned. Today, over 180 
family members are connected to the business; such a level of 
generational commitment is rare, and it speaks volumes about the values 
on which this company was built.
  Over the years, Creighton Brothers has faced its fair share of 
challenges. Still, through it all, they&#x27;ve stuck to their principles: 
producing safe, high-quality food, caring for their employees, and 
supporting the local community.
  Just last month, the town of Mentone honored Creighton Brothers as 
the Grand Marshal of the Egg Festival Parade, celebrating ``100 Years 
of Egg-cellence.&#x27;&#x27; It&#x27;s clear how deeply rooted this business is in our 
community, and we take immense pride in their success.
  As we reflect on what it takes to keep a business running strong for 
100 years, we see that it requires hard work, innovation, and an 
unshakable commitment to people. I want to congratulate everyone at 
Creighton Brothers on achieving this remarkable milestone.
  Here&#x27;s to the next 100 years of continued success.

                          ____________________

                    HONORING DARRELL McNARY COLLINS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 1, 2025

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and deep respect 
that I honor Mr. Darrell McNary Collins. Mr. Collins was a national 
treasure and has cemented himself as an Outer Banks icon though his 
work as a Historian at the Wright Brothers National Memorial where he 
shared the magnificent story of the ``Miracle at Kitty Hawk&#x27;&#x27;.
  A faithful student to the history of the Wright Brothers, his over 40 
years of learning and research led to him becoming one of the top 3 
Wright Brothers historians in the world. He shared the stories of the 
rich history of the Outer Banks, including that of his family legacy as 
part of the Freedmen&#x27;s Colony and the African American history on 
Roanoke Island.
  But Mr. Collins was much more than a historian. He cared deeply about 
his hometown of Manteo and its residents. He was appointed to his late 
mother&#x27;s Town of Manteo Commissioner seat upon her death in 2006, 
serving for the next 18 years. The town honored his dedication by 
officially declaring December 17th as the ``Honorable Darrell Collins 
Day&#x27;&#x27; to coincide with the Anniversary of Flight.
  Mr. Collins also served on the Town&#x27;s Planning Board and was a past 
President of Dare Home Health and Hospice End of Life Coalition, as 
well as the founder and President of the Pea Island Preservation 
Society, Inc.
  In 2003, Mr. Collins was personally presented with ``The Order of the 
Long Leaf Pine&#x27;&#x27; from then Governor Mike Easley, earning the state&#x27;s 
highest honor for those who have made significant contributions to the 
state and their communities.
  For his whole life Mr. Darrell McNary Collins has dedicated himself 
to the Outer Banks&#x27;s history, its people, and its future. His 
contributions are immeasurable, and his legacy will have a lasting 
impact on the people of Dare County. May we remember all of the 
contributions Mr. Collins has made to the Outer Banks, Dare County, and 
the great state of North Carolina.

 HONORING DR. DINA BENNETT FOR HER DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 
                          AMERICAN JAZZ MUSEUM

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 1, 2025

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Dina Bennett, 
Director and visionary of the American Jazz Museum (AJM), as she bids 
farewell to the iconic institution and transitions to new professional 
ambitions.
  Dr. Bennett&#x27;s dedication to sustaining, cultivating, and celebrating 
music has echoed throughout her life. Growing up in a music family, 
music was always around her; her father was in a band with her uncle, 
and as a young girl she attended the Fun Factory of the Arts, a program 
that aimed to nurture the talents of children with an interest in 
music. The camp not only gave her a space to begin exploring the 
artistry of music, but it recognized a capacity within her that was 
needed to sing. As a result, she was offered a scholarship for piano 
lessons, which gave her a consistent and formal setting to refine her 
skills. In addition to her love for music, service was an equal part of 
her life, starting with sharing her newfound expertise in piano. She 
went on to become a Minister of Music at her Baptist church, playing 
for Sunday school, for the choir, and for her dad before sermon.
  Once Dr. Bennett hit thirty, her childhood passion began to beat 
louder, and she decided it could no longer be a side-gig, music and the 
arts would be her contribution to the world. This led her to pursue her 
PhD in Folklore and Ethnomusicology, with a minor in African American 
and African Diaspora Studies at Indiana University. Dr. Bennett chose 
to study jazz; her fieldwork and dissertation took her, not to the 
birthplace of jazz, but to where it was raised: Kansas City. She did 
her anthropological work in the 18th and Vine District, and it is 
beyond fitting that her career in museum curation led her back to our 
beloved Jazz District, starting as Deputy Director of AJM and leaving 
as Director.
  AJM is a cultural touchstone of Kansas City and a beacon of the Black 
community, history and legacy. As Dr. Bennett says, ``In African 
American music, music is part of everything from birth to the grave.&#x27;&#x27; 
The strength of jazz is in its variability, in riffs and chord changes 
that demand improvisation and invention. Its melodies can serve as an 
anthem of joy, a requiem of pain, and a force of creativity and 
evolution. AJM appreciates and preserves jazz as an art form, with all 
its whims and caprices. The museum showcases legendary musicians; 
Charlie Parker, Ella Fitzgerald, and countless others who have played a 
pivotal part in composing the symphony ofAmerican jazz. Beyond 
recounting the rich history of jazz in the United States, AJM carries 
the art form into the modern era by offering jazz instruction to middle 
and high school students and orchestrating The Blue Room, a jazz club 
that hosts professional artists and community jam sessions.
  These contributions could not come to fruition without an outstanding 
conductor ensuring all the pieces move together in harmony. That is 
where Dr. Dina Bennett has so spectacularly shined. As an employee of 
AJM for nearly five years and now its Director, Dr. Bennett, has 
orchestrated the success of many remarkable exhibits at the museum. To 
mark their 25th anniversary, the museum created a timeline of jazz that 
allowed visitors to engage and share their own memories and moments in 
history, creating a community record of jazz in Kansas City. Dr Bennett 
also worked on an exhibit that partnered with Disney to examine the 
significance of the movie Soul and incorporated an interactive piano 
for guests to play themselves. In these examples and many more, the 
skill and influence of Dr. Bennett resound. She has been instrumental 
in maintaining and refining our beloved American Jazz Museum that 
Kansas City enjoys today. Dr. Bennett has set AJM on a new course, one 
that will strum new engagement with jazz and its cultural wellspring, 
while supporting the never-ending transformation of the art form in 
Kansas City and beyond.
  The time, effort, and sacrifice that Dr. Bennett has invested in the 
museum will not be forgotten and her impact will continue to ring 
through AJM and our 18th and Vine District for many years to come. With 
a surplus of gratitude, we thank her and watch with anticipation as she 
continues to be a formative voice in the legacy of jazz and Black 
music.

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the incredible dedication 
and service of Fire Captain Donald Villard of Dearborn&#x27;s Fire 
Department and well wishes on his upcoming retirement.
  Captain Villard started his service with the Dearborn Fire Department 
on June 8, 1999. Since then, Captain Villard has served as Firefighter 
1 and Firefighter 2, from there serving as Fire Engineer and six years 
later promoted to Fire Lieutenant for three years. Since 2019, Donald 
Villard has served as Fire Captain for the City of Dearborn. In his 
tenure with the department, he&#x27;s received many accolades including the 
John D. Dingell Medal of Freedom Memorial Commendation and Fire Chief 
Unit Commendation and has been awarded the Safe Driving Award over five 
times. His awards received are a reflection of his continued dedication 
and commitment to ensuring our communities are safe and protected.
  Please join me in recognizing the outstanding service and 
contributions of Fire Captain, Donald Villard, on his well-deserved 
retirement. The 12th Congressional District thanks him for his service 
to our community.

                         Friday, August 1, 2025

  Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, this is a great time to celebrate, and I want 
to offer specific thanks.
  First, I would like to recognize Dublin Mayor Chris Amorose Groomes 
for her leadership and making this community a hub for companies, 
workers, and families to settle in.
  I would also like to thank Sarnova&#x27;s CEO Brian LaDuke for investing 
further in our community and seeing the untapped potential here in 
Dublin.
  For those of you who don&#x27;t know, my team and I have been working with 
Sarnova for years, and the longer we&#x27;ve worked together, the better 
results we&#x27;ve delivered for Central Ohio.
  Today is a testament to that. Our relationship has resulted in more 
jobs and productivity in the community.
  As a national leader in equipping our first responders, Sarnova has 
been critical to saving lives. I&#x27;m sure the first responders using 
their equipment on a daily basis would agree.
  Whether it&#x27;s police officers, firefighters, or EMS workers, Sarnova 
has been there to make their jobs easier. But I firmly believe the best 
is yet to come for Sarnova, for Dublin, and for all of Central Ohio.
  As the new facility opens, I can&#x27;t wait to see what will happen here 
in the months and years to come.
  I want to thank them all, and I look forward to coming and visiting 
soon.

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
rich cultural traditions of the Basque people and to reaffirm the 
enduring friendship between the Basque Country and the United States. 
This year marks the long-awaited return of Jaialdi, one of the largest 
Basque festivals in the world and the largest of its kind in the United 
States.
  For the first time in over a decade, thousands from around the world 
are gathering in Boise, Idaho, to celebrate Basque culture through 
food, music, dance, and community. Jaialdi--meaning ``festival&#x27;&#x27; in the 
Basque language--is a joyous and spirited celebration of heritage and 
identity.
  As one of only two Basque Americans to ever serve in Congress, I am 
proud to celebrate Basque identity and tradition. Throughout my career, 
I have remained committed to strengthening the bond between the United 
States and the Basque Country. It is a friendship rooted in shared 
values, democratic ideals, perseverance, and dedication to community.
  I was honored to play a role in bringing a sapling of the Tree of 
Gernika--an enduring symbol of Basque freedom and resilience--to the 
grounds of the U.S. Capitol. The Basque-American community has long 
enriched the fabric of our Nation, and events like Jaialdi are a 
testament to its contributions.
  As Jaialdi returns to Boise this summer, I offer my warmest 
congratulations to the organizers, participants, and all who celebrate. 
May the friendship between the United States and the Basque people 
remain strong for generations to come.

                         Friday, August 1, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
remarkable life and enduring legacy of Mr. James Milton Hawkins of 
Bolton, Mississippi--a gifted musician, devoted educator, and man of 
deep faith. Mr. Hawkins served his community, his students, and his 
church with unwavering passion and humility for more than four decades.
  Born on August 12, 1950, in Bolton, Mississippi, James was the son of 
Mae Lillie Atkinson Hawkins and Eldridge Hawkins, Sr. He was a 1968 
graduate of Sumner Hill High School and went on to earn both his 
bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in music, with a concentration in voice 
and performance, from Jackson State University. A product of 
Mississippi&#x27;s rich musical and spiritual traditions, James dedicated 
his life to uplifting others through song, mentorship, and education.
  Mr. Hawkins was best known as the longtime choral director at Jim 
Hill High School in Jackson, where he built one of the most respected 
public school choir programs in the country. Under his leadership, the 
Jim Hill Choir earned national and international acclaim, performing at 
Carnegie Hall, the Mormon Tabernacle, the White House, and 
internationally in Vienna, Italy, Great Britain, and Canada. His 
students sang for presidents, dignitaries, and at major festivals, 
consistently earning top honors and recognition.
  Beyond his classroom, Mr. Hawkins was a devoted church musician at 
Orange Hill and Rose Hill M.B. Churches, where he led choirs and 
inspired generations with his spiritual gifts. He also served as music 
director for the General Missionary Baptist State Convention of 
Mississippi and was a longtime supporter of youth and music ministries 
across the state. In 2023, he founded the Sumner Hill Alumni Choir--one 
of his final gifts to the community he cherished.
  He is remembered lovingly by his devoted wife, Barbara Ann Thurman 
Hawkins; his cherished grandsons, James Hyche and Jason Butler, his 
siblings, extended family, and the countless students, friends, and 
church members whose lives he enriched. His legacy is found in the 
voices he trained, the dreams he nurtured, and the faith he lived 
daily.
  Mr. Speaker, Mr. James Milton Hawkins was a true servant of the 
people--a Mississippi treasure whose influence reached far beyond any 
stage. His life was a symphony of purpose, faith, and excellence. On 
behalf of Mississippi&#x27;s Second Congressional District, I honor his 
memory and extend my heartfelt condolences to all who loved him.

       INTRODUCTION OF THE MERCHANT MARINE ALLIES PARTNERSHIP ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                              HON. ED CASE

                               of hawaii

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 1, 2025

  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleague Congressman 
Jim Moylan of Guam, in highlighting the urgent need to modernize U.S. 
maritime policy through our Merchant Marine Allies Partnership Act, 
which we have introduced to realign federal incentives in our domestic 
shipping industry away from adversaries, such as the People&#x27;s Republic 
of China (PRC), and toward our trusted allies with proven mainline 
capacity, such as Japan and South Korea.
  Our measure directly responds to the real-world consequences of 
gaping loopholes in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as 
the Jones Act, which restricts domestic shipping including routes 
between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii to vessels that are U.S.-built, 
U.S.-flagged, U.S.-owned and U.S.-crewed. The rationale for this 
ancient and outdated restriction has always been argued as national 
security, to maintain a strong U.S. shipbuilding industry and merchant 
fleet capable of supporting the military in times of conflict.
  But today that argument, if it has any merit at all, is being 
dangerously undermined, and not by our adversaries, but by the very 
companies benefiting from the monopolistic protections of the Jones 
Act.
  Specifically, Jones Act loopholes allow for supposedly minor parts 
fabrication and supposedly minor repairs to be conducted in foreign 
shipyards using foreign workers with no condition or restriction as to 
country. But these are not minor parts but whole sections, and not 
minor repairs but full retrofits. And the preferred source of this 
fabrication and these repairs in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC).
  Jones Act vessels such as the Daniel K. Inouye, Kaimana Hila and 
Manukai have undergone major structural conversions, including 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) engine retrofits, at PRC-based shipyards 
like COSCO&#x27;s Nantong facility, which has known ties to the Chinese 
government and military-industrial complex. These modifications are 
frequently reclassified as mere ``major modifications&#x27;&#x27; to avoid 
triggering the 50 percent U.S. import duty intended to disincentivize 
foreign work. But AIS data, company filings, U.S. Coast Guard 
correspondence and even photographs confirm that these are anything but 
routine.
  This poses a significant and immediate national security concern. 
First, by enabling vessels critical to U.S. domestic supply chains to 
undergo major upgrades in foreign-controlled shipyards of adversaries, 
we introduce unnecessary strategic risk. These ships support domestic 
commerce, but they also arguably constitute the backbone of sealift 
capacity that would be required during any military mobilization. 
Second, the continued outsourcing of vessel modification and 
construction undermines the U.S. shipbuilding and repair base, leaving 
us with fewer than 100 Jones Act--compliant vessels in active service 
nationwide, many of which are aging or specialized. And third, it sends 
U.S. dollars, jobs and technological investments directly into the 
hands of a strategic competitor identified by out National Defense 
Strategy as the most significant long-term challenge to U.S. interests.
  Nowhere are the consequences of this policy failure more acute or 
more strategically dangerous than in my home state of Hawaii. Located 
in the middle of the Indo-Pacific, Hawaii is not just a remote island 
economy dependent on maritime commerce. It is the linchpin of U.S. 
power projection and force posture across the Indo-Pacific. Any 
disruption to Hawaii&#x27;s shipping system is not only an economic risk to 
our residents but a direct vulnerability in America&#x27;s strategic 
readiness.
  Moreover, while Jones Act supporters continue to claim the law 
protects U.S. jobs, the evidence says otherwise. According to the 
Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, maritime employment in the U.S. 
shipbuilding and repair sector has declined by 15 percent over the past 
23 years. This steady erosion is not due to foreign competition alone, 
but to deliberate business decisions by Jones Act carriers who choose 
to take advantage of legal loopholes that let them outsource high-value 
work overseas while still reaping the benefits of domestic 
protectionism.
  Despite these clear defects in the law, Hawaii and other islands and 
noncontiguous parts of our country remain a fully captive market, with 
no viable alternatives to a Jones Act duopoly that prioritizes profit 
over preparedness. We see no meaningful return on this federal maritime 
policy. The economic burden of this broken system, including inflated 
shipping costs driven by duopoly protections and foreign outsourcing, 
is borne daily by Hawaii&#x27;s families and businesses. We have previously 
introduced three separate measures to address these specific 
consequences.
  The overall answer for our country to this national security risk is 
not to force any and all fabrication, repair and operation exclusively 
into our country since that just compounds a problem we can&#x27;t 
effectively fix. It is instead to cease rewarding our adversaries and 
start incentivizing our international friends and allies to assist us 
with our domestic merchant marine and related defense sealift needs.
  Our Merchant Marine Allies Partnership Act addresses these problems 
through a targeted, security-conscious realignment of incentives. 
Specifically, the bill exempts the current 50 percent import duty on 
major vessel modifications only if the work is performed in shipyards 
located in allied or partner countries, such as Japan and South Korea--
nations with world-class maritime industries and deep national security 
alignment with the United States. It allows ships constructed in those 
allied countries to qualify for the U.S. domestic (coastwise) trade 
under a limited Jones Act exemption, thereby expanding access to 
modern, secure and cost-effective vessels without subsidizing 
adversarial economies. Finally, the legislation establishes a regulated 
pathway for foreign-built, foreign-crewed vessels operated by companies 
from allied nations to participate in the U.S. coastwise trade under 
clearly defined national security safeguards.
  This legislation does not repeal or abandon the Jones Act. It 
restores the law to its intended purpose--to serve as a foundation for 
national resilience, industrial strength and strategic security, rather 
than being hijacked by the hypocritical umbrella of national defense at 
the expense of increased costs of consumer goods across the country. It 
recognizes that modern maritime commerce is global, but that global 
alignment must be rooted in trust, shared values and common defense. By 
partnering with our allies and closing loopholes that empower our 
adversaries, this bill protects the U.S. supply chain, reduces security 
vulnerabilities and ensures that the Jones Act serves our people, our 
economy, and our military, not just corporate bottom lines.
  Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to continue defending a system that 
fails to defend us. The Merchant Marine Allies Partnership Act is a 
bipartisan, commonsense step toward maritime policy that reflects 21st-
century challenges and opportunities. I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation and update our maritime policy to modern world 
reality.

   INTRODUCTION OF THE TRANSPORTATION EMERGENCY RELIEF EXTENSION ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 1, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to introduce the 
``Transportation Emergency Relief Extension Act&#x27;&#x27; to safeguard federal 
funding for disaster-recovery projects. I thank U.S. Senator Alex 
Padilla (D-CA) and U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) for sponsoring the 
companion legislation and my colleague, Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) 
for cosponsoring the bill. I also want to thank the California 
Department of Transportation and the Texas Department of Transportation 
for their support of this critical legislation.
  Americans across the country are facing increasingly frequent and 
severe floods and wildfires due to the climate crisis. When disasters 
strike, our communities deserve nothing less than the full support of 
their federal government. The ``Transportation Emergency Relief 
Extension Act&#x27;&#x27; will ensure state and local governments have adequate 
time to fully utilize federal funds awarded to repair roads and 
infrastructure damaged by disasters.
  Current U.S. Department of Transportation regulations allow the 
federal government to claw back ``emergency relief&#x27;&#x27; funding for 
highway projects if those projects do not reach construction within 2 
fiscal years. The ``Transportation Emergency Relief Extension Act&#x27;&#x27; 
would repeal this regulatory deadline and provide up to 6 years for 
projects awarded these funds to advance to construction. The new 6-year 
deadline would start following the date on which a disaster was 
declared by the respective state&#x27;s governor or the president.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope that any surface transportation reauthorization 
bill this Congress will include the ``Transportation Emergency Relief 
Extension Act.&#x27;&#x27; As a member of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, I am working with my fellow colleagues deliver this 
critical priority for our communities.

  Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize and honor seven 
remarkable Americans whose military service embodies the very best of 
our Nation.
  Colonel Mark R. Baaden, Colonel John W. Mansur, Sergeant Raymond L. 
Burkard, Chief Warrant Officer Thomas W. Thompson, Sergeant Jeff 
William Patterson, Specialist Pascuale F. Coniglio, and Sergeant Lloyd 
Lasenby each served our country with honor and unwavering commitment.
  Though their paths and ranks differed, all shared a common purpose, 
to defend our freedoms and protect the values that define the United 
States of America.
  Their careers reflect decades of sacrifice and discipline. They 
represent the strength and resilience of our Armed Forces and the 
patriotism of those who serve out of a deep sense of duty.
  Some among them have borne the scars of war. Others have shaped the 
lives of those they led and mentored. All have left a lasting impact on 
their units, their communities, and this country.
  It is my distinct privilege to include their names in the Record. May 
their example inspire future generations to serve with the same 
courage, integrity, and selflessness.
