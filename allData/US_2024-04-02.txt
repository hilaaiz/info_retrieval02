               CELEBRATING GINNY WHALEN&#x27;S 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Mrs. Mary Jane Berghoff Whalen, a resident of my 
Congressional District in Kettering, Ohio, who will celebrate her 100th 
birthday on June 1, 2024.
  Ginny was an only child, born and raised on a farm in Fort Wayne, 
Indiana. She was homeschooled through eighth grade, before graduating 
from Central Catholic High School in Fort Wayne, and attended Rollins 
College in Winter Park, Florida.
  Ginny met a native Daytonian, Herbert E. Whalen, Jr., and they were 
married on June 29, 1946. They established a home in Kettering, and 
raised four children. She is currently the proud grandmother of nine 
grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. During their sixty years of 
marriage, Ginny and Herb served as role models and civic leaders in 
their community.
  As dedicated parishioners of St. Albert the Great Catholic Church in 
Kettering, Ginny and Herb worked together to renovate and expand their 
spiritual home. They served on the committee that enlarged the church 
from a one-room building in the 1940s, to the thriving community that 
currently serves over two thousand families. Ginny has remained a 
faithful member of the church for over 70 years.
  In the 1970s and 80s, Ginny and her husband worked diligently to save 
the Oregon District, one of Dayton&#x27;s oldest historic neighborhoods, 
from demolition. She worked with the city to facilitate the renovation 
of two houses and four apartments, and continues to support the 
historic preservation efforts of the Oregon Historic District Society.
  From an early age, Ginny adopted the motto: ``To give back to 
others.&#x27;&#x27; The generous amounts of time and energy she has contributed 
to a variety of volunteer and civic organizations serve as an example 
for all of us.
  Ginny remained active and involved in her community throughout her 
nineties, and has indulged in a variety of hobbies and personal 
interests that include: reading, playing the drums (which she still 
loves to do), harmonica, tennis, horseback riding, and participating in 
her local theater group ``Hamlets.&#x27;&#x27;
  I am proud to join Ginny&#x27;s family and friends in celebrating her long 
and extraordinary life. I wish her a very happy birthday, and in the 
years to come may God bless her with continued good health and 
happiness.

                          ____________________

            CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF ALLEN Q. JONES

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and 
legacy of Allen Q. Jones, who celebrates his 100th birthday on April 
11, 2024.
  Allen was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and attended Uniontown 
High School during the early years of World War II, receiving a draft 
notice shortly before graduation. In 1943, Allen departed for training 
with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 717th Tank Battalion. The following year brought 
him through Forts Chaffee, Knox, and Meade before leaving for Europe 
aboard the S.S. Cristobal on Christmas Eve, 1944. Corporal Allen Jones 
and the 717th Tank Battalion crossed the River Rhine in the spring of 
1945 and remained in Germany until the end of the war. Once he returned 
to the United States, he attended Waynesburg College and joined the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 21 in Connellsville, Pennsylvania.
  Allen stayed active in the VFW for over 70 years, winning leadership 
elections at the local and national levels. He began his tenure as 
Fayette County Commander but soon rose to the rank of District 23 
Commander. Allen&#x27;s peers elected him Pennsylvania State Commander in 
1986, where his work ethic earned national acclaim. He served on the 
VFW National Home&#x27;s Board of Trustees for two years before winning the 
Board President election in 1995. Allen gained further distinction at 
the 1999 VFW National Convention when the delegates appointed him to 
the National Council of Administration. His leadership tenure ended in 
2016 after a one-year commission as National Chief of Staff.
  Allen&#x27;s call to service inspired him to become an active member of 
the Connellsville Area School District community throughout his adult 
life. He taught science and special education for 30 years and served 
as president of the Connellsville Area Education Association after 
retiring from teaching in 1984. Allen also coached multiple sports 
teams at Connellsville Junior High School. He led the Connellsville 
Junior High East boys basketball team through an undefeated season in 
1970, cumulating in winning the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic 
Athletic League Junior Championship. He also won a league championship 
in 1984 while coaching the Connellsville Junior High girls basketball 
team. The Connellsville School Falcon Foundation recognized Allen&#x27;s 
years of commitment to student-athletes by inducting him into their 
Hall of Fame in 2016.
  Allen married Nancy Carol Dayton in 1950 and shared 70 happy years of 
marriage before her passing in 2021. The couple raised two children 
together: Marcia Knight and Charles ``Chuckie&#x27;&#x27; Jones. Over the years, 
their family grew to include two granddaughters and one great-
granddaughter.

[[Page E302]]

  Allen&#x27;s selfless service left a mark on southwestern Pennsylvania and 
made his community a better place. Few people share his remarkable 
ability to connect with and mentor young students. His story is the 
epitome of a life well-lived.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 14th 
Congressional District, I wish Allen Q. Jones a happy 100th birthday 
surrounded by friends and family.

   CONGRATULATING SPRINGFIELD NATIVE BRAD BOOKER ON WINNING AN OSCAR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. NIKKI BUDZINSKI

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Springfield 
native Brad Booker on the incredible achievement of winning an Oscar 
for his short film ``War is Over&#x27;&#x27;. This incredible achievement is even 
more impressive given that Brad was a first time Academy Award nominee.
  Booker started his journey towards this incredible achievement in 
Springfield where he attended Glenwood High School and later Lincoln 
Land Community College. Prior to his work on this short film, he worked 
as an animator at Warner Brothers Studios on films such as Iron Giant, 
Stuart Little, Spider Man, and Lord of the Rings.
  I am honored to congratulate Brad, who still lives with his family in 
Chatham, on this incredible achievement. His dedication serves as 
inspiration to me and all of those who call the Springfield region 
home. Congratulations to him, his family, and his colleagues on this 
remarkable achievement.
  I am looking forward to his next project.

                        HON. THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Ellen Locker on her retirement and honor her 26 years of service as a 
member of the Hunterdon Health System Board of Trustees.
  Under the exemplary leadership of Ms. Locker, the Hunterdon Health 
System has undergone tremendous growth. Including the opening of the 
Hunterdon Regional Cancer Center, the opening of the Norman and Denise 
Guilloud Cardiovascular Center, and the expansion of primary care and 
health and wellness care systems across New Jersey. During this time, 
Hunterdon Health not only expanded its physical network, but also 
increased its capacity to care by adopting and providing new and 
innovative procedures to treat a wider range of issues. Furthermore, 
Hunterdon Health achieved impressive recognitions during the tenure of 
Ms. Locker, including eight consecutive `Leapfrog A&#x27; Hospital

[[Page E301]]

Safety Grades, four-time Magnet hospital designation, and its first 5-
Star award from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
  In 2020, Ms. Locker championed the greatest governance reorganization 
in the organization&#x27;s history while simultaneously guiding the health 
system through the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic. The revised governance model reshaped the 41-member 
representative body into a streamlined Board of 15 Trustees and 
resulted in the elimination of redundancies, an increase in efficiency, 
and a greater alignment with Hunterdon Health&#x27;s mission and strategic 
direction.
  I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Locker for her many 
contributions to residents in the 7th District and across the state of 
New Jersey. Ms. Locker is an example of one of the many innovative 
leaders which makes the 7th District strong, and I congratulate her on 
a well-deserved retirement.

HONORING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AMY J. MARKOWICH AS SHE RETIRES FROM NAVAIR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. STENY H. HOYER

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my friend Amy Markowich as 
she retires as Executive Director for the Digital Analytics 
Infrastructure and Technology Advancement (DAiTA) and Mission Systems 
Groups, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at the 
Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)--located at Naval Air Station 
Patuxent River in my district. For over 30 years, the United States 
Navy and our community, state, and country have benefitted from her 
sound leadership. Our Congress owes her a tremendous debt of gratitude 
for her service.
  As Executive Director, Amy managed thousands of civilian and 
contractor personnel across multiple installations. She guided them in 
their work developing and testing state-of-the-art naval aviation 
systems. Amy also successfully oversaw $1.3 billion in National Asset 
laboratories, ensuring that these resources were used as effectively as 
possible to advance new technologies vital to keeping our 
servicemembers--and our Nation--safe.
  Amy&#x27;s tenure as Executive Director was just the latest chapter in a 
career defined by service and success. Appointed to the Senior 
Executive Service in 2009, Amy also served as the Department of Navy 
(DON) Naval High Performance Computing (HPC) Principal, Deputy DON Test 
&amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) Executive, the DON Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) 
Executive, and a number of other important positions.
  From spearheading development of the Air Combat Environment Test and 
Evaluation Facility, including the large anechoic chamber, and the 
Joint Simulation Environment to helping establish test configurations 
for various key aircraft, she has made numerous technical 
contributions. These cutting-edge systems continue to help prepare our 
men and women in uniform to face down challenges in the field. 
Crucially, no matter the post or project, Amy fostered a spin of 
innovation and culture of collaboration that will long endure.
  Amy&#x27;s work has also extended to representing the United States in 
many capacities at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and 
other international organizations. Amy&#x27;s leadership in both domestic 
and international situations often placed her as a top leader and often 
as the only woman in key technical roles where she established herself 
as a respected authority.
  I&#x27;ve been proud to work with Amy to ensure that Congress provides the 
hardworking team at Naval Air Station Patuxent River with the resources 
it needs to conduct this essential work. She has been an excellent host 
during my many visits to the base over the years, and I--like many 
others--will be sad to see her go. Her leadership in building 
capabilities for the Department of Defense has always been forward-
looking and provided our Nation with the tools necessary to remain at 
the forefront of development and testing of the most complex weapons 
systems in the world.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in thanking one of 
the smartest, most dedicated people I know: Amy Markowich. Although she 
is stepping back as Executive Director, I know that her commitment to 
serving her fellow Americans will never waver. For that, she has the 
gratitude of her Congress and her country. I wish Amy and her husband 
Brian well as they embark on the next chapter of their lives.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to commemorate the life of 
my dear friend, Michael J. Cioffi, who passed away on March 23, 2024 
after a courageous battle with cancer and other 9/11-related illnesses.
  A resident of Ocean Township, Michael was born and raised in Long 
Branch and served his hometown&#x27;s fire department for 14 years before 
serving with the New York City Fire Department (FDNY). Although off-
duty on September 11, 2001, the day of the attack, Michael didn&#x27;t 
hesitate to rush into New York City to assist his fellow firefighters 
and emergency personnel and spent the next several months meticulously 
working through rubble at the site.
  Despite the illnesses he endured as a result of his work at the World 
Trade Center site, Michael continued to serve with the FDNY until 2020. 
Michael was tough and determined, and his duty to serve was profound. 
Michael demonstrated character and leadership throughout his life and 
was deeply committed to each endeavor he undertook.
  Michael is survived by his loving family, including his wife Sylvia 
and six children, Michael Luciano, Sofia, Maryella, Christopher, Jack, 
and Emma. His dedication to his family was evident and I am blessed to 
have had such a wonderful friend in Michael.
  Michael should be remembered for his decades of service to Long 
Branch and New York City as a firefighter, most notably his selfless 
actions following the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center, 
which contributed to his health battles. I know I join with his family, 
friends, and fellow firefighters in paying tribute to his memory and 
the ultimate sacrifice he paid in service to our community.

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the distinguished career 
of Monica Silbas on the occasion of her retirement as Chief of Staff 
for the International President of the International Association of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). During her more than 20 years 
of union leadership, Monica has made a lasting impact throughout her 
career on behalf of working people and the Labor Movement. 
Additionally, Monica helped found the Latino Labor Lobbyists group, the 
IAM&#x27;s Spanish Leadership Program, and served as Co-Chair of the Women 
of Labor organization, in which capacity I had the great fortune of 
working alongside her.
  Monica started her career with IAM in 1986 as a Customer Service 
Agent at Northwest Airlines in Los Angeles, where she was initiated 
into IAM Local 2785. She quickly rose as a leader in organizing with 
her Labor brothers and sisters, and in 1999 became the IAM 
Transportation Department&#x27;s Education Representative. In this role, she 
initiated and won several organizing campaigns representing airline and 
railroad workers. She then joined as IAM Assistant Political and 
Legislative Director before becoming the Chief of Staff to the 
International President.
  Monica has dedicated decades of her work to expanding the reach and 
inclusion of the Labor Movement. Fluent in Spanish, Monica was among 
the founding members of the IAM&#x27;s Spanish Leadership Working Group, and 
was crucial in developing materials and resources for IAM in Spanish. 
As Co-Chair of the Women of Labor organization, she helped lift and 
encourage women in the Labor Movement. Finally, she was a member of the 
Executive Committee of IndustriALL Global Union, representing over 50 
million workers in 140 countries.
  Throughout it all, Monica has been an unwavering voice for working 
families. It has been my great pleasure to work closely with her on 
many projects and priorities over the years, and I know I speak for 
many when I say that she has been a tremendous asset to the Labor 
Movement.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in this well-deserved tribute to Monica. 
I wish her and her family all the best.

                          HONORING RALPH WHITE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of Ralph 
White.
  Born on October 25, 1931, to parents Ralph and Victoria White, Ralph 
was raised in East Boston and Westwood, Massachusetts. After graduating 
from Boston Trade High School in 1950, Ralph joined the U.S. Marine 
Corps and bravely served our country. While serving in Korea with the 
First Marine Division as a rifleman, Ralph was wounded in action 
defending his post. For his bravery, Ralph was awarded a Bronze Star 
and the Purple Heart.
  Once Ralph recovered, he returned to the U.S. and married the love of 
his life, Geraldine ``Geri&#x27;&#x27; in Kingsland, Georgia, on November 4, 
1952. He first met Geri in high school after she moved down the street 
from Ralph and his family in 1946. Ralph was still enlisted when they 
married and the couple spent their first few years of marriage living 
along the East Coast on several military bases before settling in 
Walpole, Massachusetts, in 1956.
  Together in Walpole, Ralph and Geri raised their four children--
Susan, Nancy, Lori, and William--and Ralph quickly established himself 
as a pillar of the community. He was commander of the Thomas H. Crowley 
American Legion Post 104, and as an avid baseball fan, Ralph coached 
Post 104&#x27;s baseball team for nearly six decades in addition to coaching 
Walpole High School&#x27;s baseball team for several years. To celebrate 
Ralph&#x27;s contributions to the Walpole community, the town dedicated the 
sport complex at Bird Middle School in his honor in 2015.
  Following his service with the U.S. Marine Corps, Ralph began working 
as a corrections officer at Boston&#x27;s Charles Street Jail. Ralph then 
worked at the Walpole State Prison before becoming a state parole 
officer. After he was shot on the job and survived life-threatening 
injuries, Ralph, along with several other retired state employees, 
founded Mass Retirees in 1968, and Ralph served as the association&#x27;s 
president until 2013.
  Throughout his 45 years as president, Ralph played a crucial role in 
advancing many of the laws that protect and support public retirees in 
Massachusetts, including the cost-of-living adjustment. Several decades 
ago, with Ralph leading the charge, Mass Retirees successfully 
petitioned the Commonwealth to change its laws to allow all retired 
public employees to receive a regular and cumulative cost-of-living 
adjustment. Today, Mass Retirees continues to advocate for key issues 
affecting Massachusetts retirees, such as public pensions and health 
insurance. Ralph was pivotal in growing the association into the 
critical resource that it now serves as for its 52,000 members.
  In addition to his work with Mass Retirees, Ralph served as an 
elected member on the State Retirement Board for many years and was a 
founding member of the Commonwealth&#x27;s Pension Reserves Investment 
Management (PRIM) Board, which he served on for two decades.
  Sadly, we lost Ralph too soon on January 26, 2024, at the age of 92. 
Whether it be his service with the U.S. Marine Corps, his years 
coaching youth baseball, or his nearly six decades of work on behalf of 
retirees, Ralph leaves behind an extraordinary legacy as a tireless 
advocate and mentor to many.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of Ralph White, and I ask 
that my colleagues join me in recognizing his life&#x27;s commitment to 
serving his community, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and our 
country.

        HONORING THE VALIANT SERVICE OF SERGEANT EARL WESTBROOKS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARK E. GREEN

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
recognize the valiant service of Technical Sergeant Earl Westbrooks to 
his country and the United States Army.
  Sergeant Westbrooks answered the call of duty at the Perry County 
Courthouse in 1944 at the young age of seventeen. He completed basic 
training at Fort McClellan, Alabama, whereupon he served as a non-
commissioned officer in World War II and the early days of the Korean 
War. Prior to leaving Korea in 1948, Sergeant Westbrooks trained 
members of the South Korean Army in Chan-ju, which later proved 
instrumental to the defense from the brutal communist invasion in 1950.
  Upon completing his service overseas, Sergeant Westbrooks returned to 
finish his schooling, which had been cut short by the war, and on the 
same day his son graduated from Perry County High School, Sergeant 
Westbrooks earned his GED. Ever the servant leader, he is deeply 
involved in his community and an active member of Faith Baptist Church 
in Linden, Tennessee. He is also an excellent guitarist and a former 
player in Minnie Pearl&#x27;s Grinder&#x27;s Switch Skillet Lickers, which 
performed in Odessa, Texas.
  A proud veteran, Sergeant Westbrooks is an active VFW member, and he 
regularly represents WWII veterans at events across West and Middle 
Tennessee. While he traded in his military fatigues for civvies, he 
never stopped serving his country, and you can still find him in Perry 
County, Tennessee, wearing his World War II and Korea Veterans hats 
with pride.
  Sergeant Westbrooks and the love of his life, Mrs. Aline Hinson 
Westbrooks, celebrated 74 years of marriage earlier this year. 
Together, they have three children: Deborah Hardin, Kerry Westbrooks, 
and Lisa Stayrook.
  Technical Sergeant Earl Westbrooks has lived an admirable life marked 
by service, both to his community and his country. On behalf of the 
House of Representatives and as a fellow veteran, I commend him for his 
service to our district, the state of Tennessee, and the United States 
of America.

    INTRODUCTION OF THE PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Paul Laurence Dunbar 
Commemorative Coin Act, which would direct the Secretary of the 
Treasury to mint and issue coins in honor of Paul Laurence Dunbar. This 
bill would recognize one of the first influential African American 
poets in American literature and benefit the Dunbar Alumni Federation, 
the alumni association for the Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School 
in the District of Columbia, which is historic for being the first 
public high school for African Americans in the United States. I am a 
proud graduate of Dunbar, a storied African American high school in our 
country.
  Paul Laurence Dunbar was born on June 27, 1872, to formerly enslaved 
parents, and went on to pen such classics as Majors and Minors and 
Lyrics of Lowly Life. He also composed the lyrics to In Dahomey, the 
first all-African American musical produced on Broadway. By the late 
1890s, Dunbar had become a prominent author, having had his poems 
published in major national newspapers, including The New York Times. 
Dunbar died on February 9, 1906, at age 33.
  Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School was established in 1870 as 
the Preparatory High School for Colored Youth. It was the first college 
preparatory high school for African American children in the United 
States. The school was renamed for Dunbar in 1916.
  The Dunbar Alumni Federation was organized in 2002 to provide 
scholarships and other financial support to students and graduates of 
Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School. The Federation has alumni from 
more than 35 graduating classes, and supports the school through its 
scholarship efforts, community activities and other endeavors.
  This bill would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint 
50,000 five-dollar coins, 400,000 one-dollar coins and 750,000 half-
dollar coins, with a surcharge on each coin. The surcharges would 
benefit the scholarships and similar activities of the Dunbar Alumni 
Federation.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                       RECOGNIZING ROSS K. BAKER

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, April 2, 2024

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Ross K. Baker 
on his retirement from Rutgers University. Professor Baker dedicated 
over 50 years to Rutgers University and his many achievements and 
contributions should be celebrated.
  A Distinguished Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University 
School of Arts and Sciences, Professor Baker was honored in 2021 with 
the Chancellor&#x27;s Award for Excellence in Teaching, which recognizes 
faculty members whose contributions have been significantly impactful. 
I had the distinct pleasure of speaking with Professor Baker&#x27;s classes 
numerous times and it was evident that his students valued and 
internalized his teachings.
  Specializing in American Government and U.S. Legislative Politics, 
Professor Baker brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the 
classroom. Throughout his tenure, he also served as a Visiting 
Professor at Haverford College and the University of Leipzig (Germany), 
as well as a Fulbright Lecturer at the Swedish Institute of 
International Relations in Stockholm. In addition to his academic 
background, Professor Baker worked for the offices of Senator Walter 
Mondale, Birch Bayh, Franch Church, Chuck Hagel, Patrick Leahy, and 
Harry Reid. He also served as a consultant to the Democratic Caucus of 
the U.S. House of Representatives. Likewise, he has published many 
books and articles and has contributed to USA Today and several NPR 
programs.
  Immediately prior to joining Rutgers in 1968, Professor Baker was a 
research associate at the Brookings Institute. He had also worked at 
the Special Operations Research Office and was a graduate of the 
University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Professor Ross K. Baker 
on his retirement. It is my privilege to recognize his commitment to 
education and government and offer my best wishes as he enters this new 
stage in life.

                          ____________________
