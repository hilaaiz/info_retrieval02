                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the work of the 
Women Inspiring Women Leaders chapter of the American Business Women&#x27;s 
Association (ABWA) in Fredericksburg, Virginia.
  ABWA&#x27;s Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter held its first meeting 
on May 22, 2019. Since then, the organization has provided 
opportunities for local business leaders to network, empower one 
another, and focus on growing Virginia&#x27;s economy.
  Entrepreneurship is a defining characteristic of the American spirit. 
That&#x27;s why I am proud to join them and their sister chapters in 
celebrating American Business Women&#x27;s Day.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
Fredericksburg Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter for their 
commitment to service, innovation, and empowering women in the business 
community. It is an honor to celebrate American Business Women&#x27;s Day 
alongside them.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DAVID G. VALADAO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Devon Ades for her 
leadership as President of the California Trucking Association and 
thank her for more than 30 years of dedication to California&#x27;s trucking 
industry.
  President Ades was first introduced to the trucking industry as a 
child by her father, Denny Wyatt, who served as the President of the 
California Trucking Association (CTA) in 2010. It was during her 
upbringing in the industry that President Ades realized her passion for 
trucking and the skill, hard work, and dedication required to succeed 
in the industry. President Ades began her career, much like her 
father&#x27;s, at Apex Logistics, LLC, before moving to Inland Kenworth, a 
truck dealership where she spent time working in the company&#x27;s sales, 
finance, and insurance departments. In 2005, she returned to Apex 
Logistics, where her knowledge of the industry and skillful abilities 
led her to become the company&#x27;s Vice President in 2022.
  As Vice President, Devon has consistently demonstrated an in-depth 
understanding of the challenges facing the industry. This past year, 
CTA&#x27;s Board of Directors selected Devon to be the association&#x27;s newest 
president. In this role, Devon oversees a vital component of 
California&#x27;s economy and our nation&#x27;s supply chain. Truckers transport 
highly demanded goods from ports and suppliers to our store shelves and 
homes. In the United States, truck drivers move about 71 percent of the 
economy&#x27;s products throughout the country. As president, she 
continually displays incredible leadership in the California motor 
carrier industry and advocates at the local, state, and federal levels 
to ensure sound transportation policy for her membership.
  As the 68th president of the CTA, she is only the third woman to hold 
the position. In her over 3 decades of involvement in the industry, 
President Ades has seen enormous progress in her industry. As she leads 
the organization, I know she will continue to grow CTA&#x27;s membership and 
successfully guide CTA&#x27;s ``transition to the future.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives 
to join me in thanking President Devon Ades for her commitment to the 
California Trucking Association. Her tireless service will have a 
lasting impact on the Central Valley and the Nation for generations to 
come.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF 
                                  2023

                                 ______
                                 

                  HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN

                    of the northern mariana islands

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Northern Mariana 
Islands Entrepreneurship Act of 2023, which would extend eligibility 
for the Small Business Administration&#x27;s microloan program to the 
Marianas. My bill ensures that small businesses in our islands are 
treated equitably and have access to the same assistance available in 
other parts of our Nation.
  The opportunity for people to find and grow small businesses is the 
pathway to achieving the American dream. The SBA&#x27;s microloan program 
was created to help everyday Americans do just that--with loans of up 
to $50,000, small business owners can jumpstart their dreams by 
investing the micro loan towards inventory, supplies, machinery, 
equipment, and more. And when our small businesses thrive, we all stand 
to benefit. According to a 2019 report from the SBA, small businesses 
create two-thirds of net new jobs and drive U.S. innovation and 
competitiveness.
  Yet this opportunity is not available to all Americans. My home, the 
Marianas, is the only jurisdiction in the Nation that is ineligible for 
the microloan program.
  My bill ends this inequity and provides a path to entrepreneurship 
for all small business owners, no matter where they choose to live in 
the U.S.
  I thank my colleague, Ms. Radewagen, who joined me in introducing 
this important bipartisan legislation.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Saturday, October 
7th, as Ageism Awareness Day. Ageism Awareness Day provides us all with 
an opportunity to recognize the existence and impact of ageism in our 
country.
  We are fortunate to live in a time in which medicine and technology 
can allow individuals to live long and full lives. As society begins to 
grow older, however, too many individuals experience ageism, or 
stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination based on age.
  Ageism is the most widespread and socially accepted form of 
prejudice. It can be found throughout society, from our workplaces to 
our health systems to stereotypes broadcast in the media. Not only is 
ageism harmful in and of itself, but it also exacerbates many of the 
other ``isms&#x27;&#x27;, including racism, sexism, and ableism, which compound 
and worsen mental and physical health outcomes for affected 
individuals.
  I am proud to represent Southern Nevada, a place that has long been a 
welcoming home to nearly 375,000 seniors. They enrich our community 
tremendously, and their value should not be diminished by undue 
prejudice and discrimination. Organizations such as Nevada Senior 
Services provide essential services to individuals across Southern 
Nevada as they age and ensure that aging is not viewed with fear or 
hostility. Nevada Senior Services not only operates the Adult Day Care 
Centers of Las Vegas and Henderson, but also Caregiver Support 
Programs, Respite and Personal Care, RAMP Home Modifications, Hospital 
2 Home Assistance, and the Care Partner Institute.
  I applaud and support the goals and ideals of Ageism Awareness Day 
which sheds light on the plight of many individuals and brings the 
Nation together to promote acceptance and appreciation of the gifts of 
aging persons. I thank all the family members, professionals, and 
volunteers who assist aging individuals every day and help fight the 
stigma of ageism.

              RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS&#x27; LONGEST MARRIED COUPLE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN

                              of arkansas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, many people are familiar with the passage 
of scripture found in First Corinthians Chapter 13, verse 4, ``Love is 
patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not 
proud.&#x27;&#x27; However, fewer may remember verse 5 which states that love 
``always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.&#x27;&#x27; 
When the apostle Paul was inspired to write these words so many years 
ago, I believe he had persevering and loving couples like Cleovis and 
Arwilda Whiteside in mind. Since 2019, the Whitesides have been 
recognized as Arkansas&#x27; ``Longest Married Couple.&#x27;&#x27; This Sunday, 
September 24, 2023, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, they are being recognized 
for their 84th year of marriage.
  On what I am sure was a hot and humid Monday, July 24, 1939, 17-year-
old Cleovis and 13-year-old Arwilda made a lifetime commitment to God 
and each other that has endured the test of time. The next year, Mrs. 
Whiteside delivered the first of their 12 children. In an interview 
last year, Mr. Whiteside, who was 100 at the time, stated, ``We&#x27;ve been 
together all this long time and I still love my wife. She still loves 
me, and we still get along just as good.&#x27;&#x27; Mrs. Whiteside added, ``I 
ran to him since I was nine years old and I&#x27;ve run first to God, then 
him ever since.&#x27;&#x27; We find within these 2 statements the foundation of a 
strong, Christ-centered marriage that inspires me and countless people, 
in Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, and the entire state of Arkansas.
  At the end of the 13th chapter of Corinthians, Paul tells us that 
when all is complete, 3 things remain: ``faith, hope, and love. But the 
greatest of these is love.&#x27;&#x27; I offer my most sincere congratulations to 
Mr. Cleovis and Mrs. Arwilda Whiteside on their 84 years of marriage. I 
thank them for exemplifying the greatest gift of persevering love.

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dorsey O&#x27;Neal 
Walker, a Texan who valiantly served our Nation during some of the 
darkest hours of WWII.
  Dorsey grew up in Ora, a small Angelina County community, graduating 
in 1942 from Huntington High School. Drafted during WWII,

[[Page E878]]

he joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1944. Assigned to the Fourth Marine 
Division in Maui, Hawaii, as Company Clerk because he could type, 
Dorsey would soon deploy with the Fourth Marines in 3 major Pacific war 
battles: Saipan, Tinian, and Iwo Jima. When returned to Maui from 
Saipan for replacements, he was 1 of only 12 among 200 in his company 
not killed or wounded. Then Corporal Walker&#x27;s first Reserve separation 
from the Corps occurred in December 1945; his final Reserve separation 
occurred in 1948. Dorsey and his wife Habie have been married for 77 
years.
  Commendation Citations received from his Commanding General 
illuminate Dorsey&#x27;s valor:

       ``For excellent performance of duties in connection with 
     operations against the enemy on Saipan and Tinian, Marianas 
     Islands from 15 June to 1 August 1944. Private First Class 
     Walker diligently performed every assigned duty. His 
     willingness to give battle, and his indifference to the 
     hardships which he encountered throughout operation, evoked 
     the admiration of his officers and the men serving with him. 
     His unselfish devotion to the task at hand was a material 
     contribution to the early and complete victory over the 
     enemy. His conduct throughout was in keeping with the highest 
     traditions of the United States Naval Service.&#x27;&#x27;
       ``For excellent service in the line of duties as a Radio 
     Operator with a rifle company in combat with the enemy on Iwo 
     Jima, Volcano Islands, from 19 February to 16 March 1945. 
     Corporal Walker skillfully carried out his assigned duties 
     under the most hazardous combat conditions. Frequently, on 
     reconnaissances with his company commander or at a forward 
     observation post, he unhesitantly exposed himself to enemy 
     mortar and small arms fire to carry out his duties 
     successfully, and by his extraordinary resourcefulness and 
     efficiency, he rendered invaluable aid to his company. His 
     conduct throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions 
     of the United States Naval Service.&#x27;&#x27;

  It is my distinct honor to recognize Dorsey O&#x27;Neal Walker, a Texan, 
an American, and a ``True Patriot,&#x27;&#x27; as one of the oldest living 
survivors of the Battle of Iwo Jima.

                           HON. PETE SESSIONS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to present Ellen M. Brooks of 
Crockett, Texas,

[[Page E876]]

with a Congressional Veteran Commendation. Her service to this nation 
and community speaks to the best of Texas.
  Ellen enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1994. Recognizing 
her innate leadership capabilities, the Air Force sent her to officer 
training after only two and a half years as an enlisted Airman. During 
the five years she served as a commissioned officer, Ellen rose to the 
rank of Captain. Before leaving the U.S. Air Force in 1998, she served 
as Commander of a communications unit in Alaska. During her active 
service she was recognized with the Air Force Commendation Medal w/1 
device, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award w/1 device, and the 
National Defense Service Medal, together with a Good Conduct Medal, Air 
Force Longevity Service Award, Air Force Overseas Long Tour Ribbon, and 
Air Force Training Ribbon w/1 device.
  Ellen has given much to her community. In 2007 she joined the 
Crockett Noon Lions Club and was instrumental in forming the Leo Club 
where she served as Sponsor. She established a new Evening Lions Club 
and served as its first President. She has spent countless hours 
investing in the lives of the members and youth, teaching leadership, 
character, and kindness. She is a member of First United Methodist 
Church. Whether working to keep her community clean or distributing 
food to the needy, Ellen can always be counted on. In 2020, the 
Crockett Area Chamber of Commerce recognized Ellen&#x27;s service to the 
community with its highest honor, Citizen of the Year.
  Her leadership will have a long-lasting effect on young people for 
years to come--and it is my honor to award Ellen M. Brooks of Crockett, 
Texas, a Congressional Veteran Commendation.

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present retired U.S. Army 
Sergeant First Class Jerry Lee Lorton, of Cameron, Texas, with a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation. His servant&#x27;s life reflects the 
hard work and dedication that exemplifies the best of our Central Texas 
values.
  Jerry Lorton entered active duty at Atlanta, Georgia in May of 1977--
a young 20-year-old about to embark on a distinguished Army career that 
would span the next two decades of his life.
  Retired Sergeant Lorton&#x27;s Army career would take him on 5 overseas 
tours, including to the Persian Gulf War and 2 tours in Korea. His 
dedication was rewarded many times. Recognized for expert marksmanship 
with rifle, pistol, and grenade, he earned an Army Commendation Medal, 
Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), National Defense Service Medal, 
Southwest Asia Service Medal with 2 Bronze Service Stars, Master 
Aircraft Crewman Badge, and an Air Assault Badge.
  Since retiring in 1997, Jerry Lorton has been a dedicated servant 
leader in his community. For more than a quarter century he has helped 
protect his neighbors and community as a volunteer firefighter with the 
Cameron Volunteer Fire Department. He serves as a Deacon in his faith 
community, Cameron&#x27;s Grace Church, where he continues to protect his 
neighbors as one of a four-person church security team. He works as a 
school bus driver for the Cameron Independent School District. A 
patriot and a leader, he currently serves as the Commander of Cameron&#x27;s 
VFW Post 2010, having long been the kind of member that, in the words 
of the Texas District 28 Commander, ``exemplifies everything the VFW 
wants in its leaders.&#x27;&#x27;
  I proudly commend Sergeant First Class Jerry Lee Lorton, USA, (Ret,) 
to his friends, family, and colleagues, and salute his service to the 
Army and Texas by awarding him a Congressional Veteran Commendation 
from the 17th Congressional District of Texas.

tactical skills in law enforcement personnel, and better and safer 
hunters. He has served as a 4-H Shooting Sports Coach. He shares 
personal safety and situational awareness knowledge with his local 
volunteer fire department and other organizations. David spends many 
hours sharing outdoors and hunting knowledge with young people and 
making Veterans Day presentations in local schools.
  It is my honor to award retired SEAL Senior Chief David A. Knesek,

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th 
anniversary of Owens Community College&#x27;s Findlay Campus in Findlay, 
Ohio. Throughout the years, Owens has been a comprehensive community 
college providing educational opportunities and training to the 
residents of our communities. The hard work and spirit shown by 
generations of students and faculty have made Owens an outstanding 
educational institution.
  Originally, Owens Community College was founded in 1965 in Wood 
County. The college was name after Michael J. Owens, a Toledo-based 
inventor of automated glass bottle-making technology. In 1983 Owens 
opened their Findlay Campus which occupies more than 60 acres. With 
their new campus, Owens was able to expand its coverage and continue to 
provide education to students from all walks of life. Currently, 
Owens&#x27;s service district includes Lucas, Wood, Hancock, and parts of 
Ottawa counties.
  Owens Community College offers more than 160 programs and 
certificates to its students who are preparing for a career, retraining 
for a new career, seeking professional development, or obtaining 
credits to transfer to a 4-year college or university. Their dedicated 
faculty members bring industry knowledge, information, and ideas into 
the classroom to provide students with a better understanding, how 
studies will translate into careers. Outside the classroom, students 
can experience an enriching campus life through student activities, 
clubs and organizations, athletics, and volunteer activities.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute 
to Owens Community College and its students, faculty, and 
administration on this remarkable occasion. By celebrating the 40th 
anniversary, community members and Ohio residents recognize Owens&#x27;s 
contribution to its students and the surrounding communities. 
Congratulations to Owens Community College on this significant 
milestone.

       PITLIANGAS FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF 
                            REPRESENTATIVES

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL WALTZ

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 21, 2023

  Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Lieutenant Colonel Mark 
Pitliangas of the United States Air Force for his extraordinary 
dedication to duty and service to our Nation. Lieutenant Colonel 
Pitliangas recently transitioned from his assignment as a Deputy 
Director of Congressional Affairs for United

[[Page E877]]

States Transportation Command to fly the KC-46 Pegasus at Joint Base 
McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey as Chief of Safety, 305th Air 
Mobility Wing.
  Lt Col Pitliangas is the first member of his family to serve in our 
U.S. Air Force. Mark attended the United States Air Force Academy and 
was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 2008 before attending pilot 
training. From there, he went on to fly the mighty C-130 Hercules, 
otherwise known as the ``Four Fans of Freedom&#x27;&#x27; and honorably served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan as a combat pilot over 3 deployments. Lt Col 
Pitliangas has held numerous leadership positions in a variety of 
units, highlighted by serving as the Director of Operations for the 
386th Expeditionary Operations Support Squadron in Kuwait. During that 
time, he enabled 29,000 airlift and air refueling missions directly 
supporting Operations INHERENT RESOLVE and FREEDOM&#x27;S SENTINEL flown 
from our busiest airfield in United States Central Command.
  In the winter of 2020, Mark was selected to serve as Deputy Director 
of Congressional Affairs under the United States Transportation 
Command. As the primary liaison between Members of Congress, 
congressional staff, committees, and USTRANSCOM, he provided valuable 
insight and understanding of transportation policies, actions, 
operations, and requirements. His first-hand knowledge of the military, 
its culture, and traditions has been a tremendous benefit to our 
Congressional offices. His dogged determination and exceptional 
coordination enabled the USTRANSCOM Commander to accomplish over 40 
office calls with Members and Staff in preparation for her annual 
posture testimony.
  Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with Lieutenant Colonel 
Pitliangas during his time representing the United States 
Transportation Command on Capitol Hill. On behalf of our grateful 
Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless service and sacrifice 
of Mark, his wife, Eleni, and their children, Stephanos, George, and 
Nicholas. I wish them the very best as they continue their journey in 
our United States Air Force. They have dedicated their lives to the 
service of our great Nation.
  Aim High . . . Fly, Fight, and Win.
