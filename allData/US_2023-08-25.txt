   HONORING DR. WILLIAM BOONE UPON HIS RETIREMENT FROM CLARK ATLANTA

                                 ______
                                 



                          HON. NIKEMA WILLIAMS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Dr. 
William H. Boone on his retirement from the illustrious Atlanta-based 
HBCU Clark Atlanta University, his appointment as Professor Emeritus, 
and thank him for his impact on the people of Georgia&#x27;s Fighting Fifth 
District.
  Called the ``Dean of Atlanta City Politics,&#x27;&#x27; Dr. Boone has spent the 
last 40 years researching, advising, and commentating on Atlanta 
political life and Black political power across the South. He earned 
the respect of his peers and colleagues, serving as Assistant Provost, 
Dean of Graduate Studies, and the Chair of the Political Science 
Department at Clark Atlanta University as well as a president of the 
National Conference of Black Political Science.
  Dr. Boone&#x27;s talent as an educator is evident by the students he has 
produced. The people of Atlanta, of Georgia, and of the South have 
greatly benefited from the thoughtful, critical, and thorough analysis 
and scholarship Dr. Boone and his students have produced and will 
continue to produce for decades. As we all know, Atlanta Influences 
Everything, especially Black political power. Dr. Boone&#x27;s focus on 
Black politics has improved our understanding of our own community and 
America&#x27;s understanding of the cultural and political factors that 
inform and shape our present.
  Dr. Boone takes his role as a leader in Black intellectual thought 
seriously. He always aims to be unapologetic when looking at the Black 
experience in this country, and to critically examine how the American 
experience affects Black people. And he always makes sure to connect 
training and education to activism; to fighting for our community.
  Congratulations to the Dean of Atlanta City Politics, Dr. William 
Boone. The people of Georgia&#x27;s 5th Congressional District have learned 
so much from him for the last 40 years, and we will continue to learn 
from him and those lucky enough to learn from him, for decades more to 
come. I hope he enjoys his retirement.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service 
of Sergeant Paul R. Daw, a Vietnam War veteran and upstanding 
constituent of New York&#x27;s 21st District.
  Paul was raised in Long Island, New York. After graduating high 
school, he joined the United States Army, serving for 2 years in the 
Vietnam War from July 1969 to May 1971. Sergeant Daw was stationed in 
Vietnam as an Eleven-Bravo infantryman alongside his fellow men with 
the 1st Cavalry Division, Ranger Company A.
  For his service, Sergeant Daw was highly decorated. Upon his 
honorable discharge in 1971, Sergeant Daw earned a Bronze Star with 2 
oak leaf clusters, a Purple Heart with an oak leaf cluster, the Vietnam 
Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, the Combat 
Infantry Badge, the Army Accommodation Medal for Valor, and the Good 
Conduct Medal.
  After returning home to Long Island from Vietnam, Sergeant Daw joined 
the New York Police Department, where he served for 21 and a half years 
as an officer of the law. Off the force, Sergeant Daw also supported 
his community as a volunteer firefighter until his retirement from the 
NYPD in 2003, at which time he moved upstate to the North Country.
  In his retirement, Sergeant Daw has taken time to focus on his family 
life. He and his wife

[[Page E796]]

Jean have been happily married for 16 years, in the company of his 
children Jason and Kelly and stepdaughter Katie.
  Sergeant Paul R. Daw&#x27;s life of service and bravery is truly 
admirable. On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, it is my honor to 
recognize the remarkable life of Sergeant Paul R. Daw.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 
Hometown Hero, Jeff Williams. In 2012, Jeff founded Taste Project, an 
organization that provides meals in Fort Worth to those in need. Jeff 
knew what food scarcity felt like growing up in a family of 4 where 
both of his parents worked hard to keep food on the table even though 
money was tight. When he was younger, his parents would sometimes skip 
meals to make sure him and his sister had dinner. Jeff&#x27;s upbringing 
gave him the idea to create a place where members of the community 
could go to always get an affordable meal. In 2017, the Taste Project 
opened a pay-what-you-can community restaurant in Fort Worth, the Taste 
Community Restaurant, where diners can pay as little as a penny for a 
meal. Beyond the restaurant, the Taste Project empowers and provides 
hope to North Texans through culinary classes, job training programs, 
and even a community garden that helps teach people gardening skills. 
In the last 6 years, Jeff and Taste Community Restaurant have helped 
more than 150,000 people and are currently serving more than 1,000 
people a week. Jeff and his team work hard every day to make sure they 
help as many people as possible. I&#x27;d like to thank Jeff for his 
dedication to serving the people and families of North Texas.

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 
Hometown Hero, the Coppell Fire Department. Due to a power failure at 
the Village Parkway Pump Station earlier this year, the City of Coppell 
announced a Boil Water Notice and requested that residents and 
businesses only use water in emergency situations. The Coppell Fire 
Department&#x27;s Emergency Management and Public Works team leapt into 
action and helped restore power to the water pump, all during a brutal 
Texas heatwave. The department offered multi-faceted assistance, from 
staffing the Emergency Operations Center, providing heat rehab support 
at the distribution point, transporting water from local vendors to the 
public library, on top of the normal daily operational items. I&#x27;d like 
to thank the Coppell Fire Department for their quick response and 
service to the residents of Texas-24 by helping make Coppell&#x27;s water 
safe to drink again.

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
service of Major Laterrious ``Tony&#x27;&#x27; Starks, who served as a 
legislative liaison for the U.S. House of Representatives with profound 
duty, leadership, and commitment from January 2021 to August 2023. 
Major Starks served as a defense fellow for my office, and, as a 
legislative liaison, his interpersonal skills built countless 
relationships throughout Headquarters, Department of the Army, and 
Capitol Hill. These relationships enabled him to communicate the Army&#x27;s 
narrative and facilitate senior leader engagements. In addition to the 
duties as a legislative

[[Page E797]]

liaison, Major Starks expertly balanced a collateral duty as the White 
House Social Aide Senior Program Manager. His professionalism has 
resulted in strategic success across the Executive Branch. Due to his 
exceptional efforts, he was selected to lead over 100 White House 
events, to include two Medal of Honor Ceremonies and three State 
Visits.
  In addition to his military-based contributions to our great nation, 
which have included service in many parts of the United States as well 
as in other countries, to include Germany and Korea, Major Starks is 
well-versed educationally, having invested himself in various levels of 
university programs. Major Starks&#x27;s education includes studying at 
George Washington University, pursuing a master&#x27;s degree in Legislative 
Affairs, from 2020 to 2021; studying at the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill as a Strategic Studies Fellow, in 2019; 
studying at Abilene Christian University, pursuing a doctorate&#x27;s degree 
in Education, from 2018 to 2021; and studying at Stephen F. Austin 
State University, pursuing an undergraduate degree in Political Science 
and Government, from 2006 to 2010. He is currently a doctoral 
candidate.
  Major Starks is an outstanding individual who has already served his 
country in many ways, and it is my honor to esteem him today.

              HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF PAMELA ROSS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the legacy of a Livingston 
County, Michigan woman whose life, though cut tragically short, was a 
testament to kindness, inclusivity, and tolerance. Pamela Ann Ross of 
Brighton never sought attention, never wanted credit for the light she 
spread so generously everywhere she went. But as those who love her 
grapple with her loss, we must lift up her life as an example of what 
it really means to live in community.
  Pam loved her state and the people in it. A proud graduate of Milford 
High School, she traveled right down the road to attend Michigan State 
University, leaving the state only briefly to pursue a Master&#x27;s degree 
in teaching from Arizona State University. Pam brought those skills and 
talents back home, seeking to help set students up for success as 
citizens of the world and inspire in them a drive to do well and 
succeed in life. To this day, she is remembered as a beloved and 
inspirational second grade teacher who wanted nothing more than to see 
her students reach their full potential.
  As she built her family, first with husband Stan and later with their 
2 sons, Jackson and Nicholas, and 2 canine ``children,&#x27;&#x27; Luna and 
Bella, Pam made the decision to devote herself fully to the homefront. 
But she never stepped back from her mission to be of service to others, 
nor did she ever stop seeing the very best in people. Pam was a 
steadfast volunteer in her children&#x27;s classrooms, with Boy Scouts, and 
with numerous community organizations, including Habitat for Humanity 
where she served on the board of directors for many years.
  Pam was also a fierce advocate for equality, and a firm believer that 
every child and every person in the community deserves love, 
acceptance, and respect just as they are. She was particularly 
passionate about vulnerable populations, speaking out in her firm but 
loving way at school board meetings and organizing events in support of 
LGBTQ+ and minority students, as well as those with disabilities.
  But it was Pam&#x27;s quiet life of service that her friends and family 
remember most: the way holiday and birthday gifts would appear on the 
porches of neighborhood children whose parents were going through tough 
times, or the gift cards those same parents would find under their 
doormats, the backpacks she stuffed full of school supplies for kids 
who might otherwise go without, the meal deliveries that just showed up 
for families in need. Pam never attached her name to those gifts. But 
everyone knew where they came from--and the love behind them.
  Mr. Speaker, in this world there are those who dream of a better 
world and those who actively work to make it so, and Pam was the rare 
blend of both. In Pam&#x27;s world, neighbors looked after each other no 
matter what, and strangers were merely friends she had yet to meet. Her 
unexpected passing leaves a deep void in the hearts and lives of so 
many, and I send my deepest condolences to her family, friends, and all 
who knew and loved her. May her memory live on in every step we 
actively take toward a kinder, more inclusive community. Everyone was 
welcome in Pam&#x27;s heart and in her home, so it is fitting that her 
legacy will forever be remembered.

  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my friend, 
Craig Allen Keith, who passed away at Parkview Regional Medical Center 
in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on August 14, 2023.
  Craig was born in Van Wert, Ohio on May 31, 1976. He was a 1994 
graduate of Crestview High School in Convoy, Ohio, and earned his 
bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from Indiana Wesleyan 
University in 2003. A consummate professional in domestic and 
international travel for 20 years, Craig served as Senior Commercial 
Account Project Manager at SIRVA BGRS Worldwide, Inc.
  Craig attended Abundant Life Church for 30 years and held several 
leadership positions. He loved his church unconditionally and served 
the Lord with gladness all his days.
  Craig loved entertaining and spending time with his friends and 
family. While grilling and smoking meats or baking his (in)famous 
chocolate chip cookies, he would tell jokes and fill the air with his 
full, boisterous laughter. Craig was an avid traveler who loved 
learning the history of the many destinations he visited. He sang 
loudly, off key, and with all his heart, in church and to the gospel 
music he loved so much.
  Craig will be immensely missed and forever loved by all. He was 
preceded in death by his maternal and paternal grandparents. He is 
survived by his children, Gentry and Pierson Keith; mother, Sheila 
(Vince) Stone of Columbia City, IN; father, Leroy (Karen) Keith of St. 
Marys, OH; brother, Adam (Azeesat) Keith of Boston, MA; a stepsister, 
Tonya Kessler; a godson, Ethan Brownlee of Noblesville, IN; and a host 
of other relatives and close friends.
  In the wake of his passing, I wish Craig&#x27;s family peace, comfort, and 
joy in knowing he lived a happy and fulfilled life. Though he is no 
longer with us, his spirit lives on in the minds and souls of those 
whom he knew and loved most.

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Judge Vernon 
Smith, who passed away at the age of 79 on July 29, 2023. Vernon served 
as a respected jurist and community leader throughout his professional 
career.
  Vernon was born on December 7, 1943 in San Francisco, and moved to 
Sleepy Hollow in Marin County as a teenager. He attended Sir Francis 
Drake High School in San Anselmo, and then completed both undergraduate 
studies and law school at the University of San Francisco, finishing 
his studies in 1968. With a focus on public service, Vernon began his 
law career at the Marin County District Attorney&#x27;s Office in 1969.
  Vernon served as a prosecutor in the District Attorney&#x27;s Office for 
five years before joining the Novato law firm Trumbull, Rush &amp; Smith, 
where he would gain experience with both criminal and civil cases. 
During his tenure with private practice, he continued to build his 
reputation as a caring and competent member of the legal profession. 
Vernon returned to public service in 1982, when he was selected as a 
Marin County court commissioner.
  After 5 years as commissioner, Vernon was elected to the Municipal 
Court as a judge. He was instrumental in the court consolidation 
process, and Vernon went on to serve as the first presiding judge of 
the newly consolidated Marin County Superior Court. As he rose in 
seniority, Vernon would serve as supervising judge for the civil, 
probate, juvenile, family law, and criminal divisions. His impeccable 
standing with the community led him to continued electoral success. He 
retired in 2007 after serving 25 years on the bench.
  Vernon enjoyed more time with his family after retiring, but he also 
stayed engaged in his professional community. He served as a mediator 
with Resolution Remedies, a Sausalito-based legal dispute mediation 
service, and taught legal courses at the College of Marin and Dominican 
University of California in San Rafael.
  Vernon is survived by his wife of 52 years, Linda, his sons Brent and 
Ryan, daughter Claire, and 4 grandchildren. While he will be greatly 
missed, Vernon&#x27;s legacy will live on through the positive impact he had 
on his community and beyond.
  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you join me in extending 
condolences to Vernon&#x27;s family and friends, and in expressing my 
appreciation for his decades of work for the public good and for 
sharing his life experiences with us.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor a local hero who bravely 
served and defended our Nation overseas, then returned home to build a 
thriving life and business back in Michigan. As Willis James Rockwood 
celebrates his 100th birthday, I pay tribute to his extraordinary life 
of service and dedication to his country, his family, and his 
community.
  Willis Rockwood was born on August 26, 1923 in Long Rapids, Michigan. 
He enlisted in the United States Army where he proudly served as an 
infantryman and squad leader during World War II. His service took him 
across the world and back, fighting with and for our allies in the 
European and Pacific theaters. Willis&#x27; exemplary service earned him 
multiple awards and commendations, including a Good Conduct Medal and a 
letter of recognition from President Harry S. Truman.
  Upon his honorable discharge, Willis returned to Michigan where he 
and his best friend from the Army set out to use their skills and 
talents to build a life not just for themselves but for others, a plan 
that came together as Flositz and Rockwood Quality Home Builders. This 
successful construction company flourished for decades, and in 1949, 
the foundation of Willis&#x27; own family was installed when he married 
Marion Elizabeth Storing. They spent 65 wonderful years together until 
her passing in 2015, and their love expanded many times over with the 
additions of 3 children, 3 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.
  Willis Rockwood built his post-Army life in the Lansing, Michigan, 
area, where he has devoted himself to many organizations and community 
groups, including the American Legion Post No. 238, the Church of the 
Nazarene where he taught Sunday School, and his neighborhood watch, 
where he is known for generously shoveling driveways and sidewalks 
throughout the community. He is a man of many hobbies and talents, 
including wood carving, flying his plane, and bowling. And in the large 
and loving family he established, Willis is beloved as the historical 
archivist and storyteller, with a zest for life and a laugh that echoes 
across multiple generations.
  Mr. Speaker, Willis Rockwood is a man who has spent his long and 
fruitful life deeply devoted to his family, his friends, his country, 
and his faith. Those who know and love him fondly refer to him as their 
``National Treasure,&#x27;&#x27; and I assert that he is just that. On the 
occasion of his 100th birthday, I salute his life of service, and want 
to reflect our community, our state, and our Nation&#x27;s gratitude for all 
he has contributed and constructed.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the life of 
Staff Sgt. Darren James ``DJ&#x27;&#x27; Breton, who has recently passed away at 
age 32, and to honor his service to the Nation.
  Born in Wiesbaden, Germany, DJ embarked on a remarkable journey that 
took him across the globe and led him to proudly serve his country 
through his role as a crew chief in the United States Air Force.

[[Page E798]]

  His passion for sports, particularly hockey, became the heartbeat of 
his life. DJ generously shared his love for the game by dedicating his 
time to the Youth Hockey League, where he not only nurtured young 
talents but also found immense joy. To both the youths he mentored and 
the family he deeply cherished, DJ brought a lighthearted sense of 
humor and an essence of selflessness, dependability, and respect for 
others.
  DJ will be remembered for his legacy of service, care, and joy. He is 
survived by his loving father Dennis; his devoted mother, Kimberly; and 
his 2 adoring sisters, Cassandra and Hanna. DJ was, and is, well-loved 
and highly respected amongst his family and community, and his memory 
will not soon be forgotten.
  I pray that his loved ones may be comforted as they mourn his loss. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in honoring the life and legacy of 
Staff Sgt. Darren James Breton.

                   RECOGNIZING DR. CLARENCE B. JONES

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RITCHIE TORRES

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the 60th 
anniversary of the historic ``I Have a Dream&#x27;&#x27; speech delivered by the 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I rise to honor not only the 
transformative impact of this iconic address but also to recognize the 
significant contribution of Dr. Clarence B. Jones to its creation. 
Furthermore, it is imperative that we acknowledge the instrumental role 
that the vibrant Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale played in the enduring 
legacy of this momentous event.
  The ``I Have a Dream&#x27;&#x27; speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during 
the March on Washington, stands as an indelible marker of American 
history. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s eloquence and vision, as 
expressed in that speech, continue to inspire and challenge us to this 
day. His words called for unity, justice, and equality, transcending 
the barriers of time and space to resonate with generations that 
followed.
  Yet, we must not forget the individuals who labored behind the scenes 
to shape Dr. King&#x27;s words into a powerful message that moved hearts and 
ignited change. Among them, Dr. Clarence B. Jones, a brilliant and 
dedicated speechwriter, lawyer, and trusted advisor, played a pivotal 
role in crafting the speech&#x27;s content. His intellect, passion, and 
commitment to justice were integral to capturing the essence of the 
civil rights movement and encapsulating the dreams and aspirations of 
millions.
  Moreover, as we reflect on the ``I Have a Dream&#x27;&#x27; speech, we must 
recognize the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale&#x27;s important connection to 
this historic moment. Riverdale, known for its diverse community and 
rich cultural tapestry, served as an inspirational backdrop for 
discussions and dialogues that fueled the civil rights movement. It was 
a place where individuals from various walks of life gathered, 
exchanged ideas, and organized actions that contributed to the momentum 
for change.
  Riverdale&#x27;s commitment to social justice and equality is a testament 
to the enduring values that continue to shape our Nation. As we 
commemorate this 60th anniversary, let us not only celebrate the 
progress we have made but also recommit ourselves to the unfulfilled 
aspects of the dream. Let us strive for a society where justice 
prevails, where all individuals are judged by the content of their 
character, and where the legacy of the ``I Have a Dream&#x27;&#x27; speech lives 
on in our actions.
  It is a great privilege to honor Dr. Clarence B. Jones&#x27; contribution 
to the crafting of the ``I Have a Dream&#x27;&#x27; speech and in recognizing the 
vital role that the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale played in shaping 
the ideals and aspirations that continue to guide our Nation toward a 
more just and equitable future.

  RECOGNIZING TERESITA BATAYOLA, AAPCHO AND NACHC LIFETIME ACHIEVMENT 
                            AWARD RECIPIENT

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Teresita 
Batayola for receiving lifetime achievement awards from the Association 
of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) and the 
National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC).
  Over the years, I have had the immense privilege of witnessing 
Teresita&#x27;s tireless work to improve health outcomes for refugee, 
immigrant, and underserved communities in Washington&#x27;s Ninth District 
and across the Puget Sound region. Teresita&#x27;s career as the President 
and CEO of the International Community Health Services (ICHS) was 
remarkable. She helped transform ICHS from just 2 clinics into a 
growing regional health care network that continues to provide 
comprehensive care to over 27,000 patients.
  Teresita&#x27;s work went beyond just leading ICHS for 18 years. During 
her tenure at ICHS, she also took on leadership roles at the local and 
national level to help expand access to health care and other services 
for those that need it most. Her dedication to expanding health care 
access in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander 
communities led her to serve on the AAPCHO&#x27;s Board of Directors for 
well over a decade. Her years of steadfast leadership has been 
instrumental in advancing the resources and capacity of community 
health centers across the country, building a legacy that communities 
will continue to benefit from for decades to come. These lifetime 
achievement awards from AAPCHO and NACHC are a well-deserved testament 
to that legacy and to Teresita&#x27;s exemplary service.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Teresita for her visionary leadership, and I 
congratulate her on these achievements.

                       RECOGNIZING TRENTON BRAZIE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MARILYN STRICKLAND

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 25, 2023

  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Trenton 
Brazie, an Army veteran who continues to answer the call of service 
everyday as a firefighter, Emergency Medical Technician, and CPR public 
education instructor here in our South Sound community.
  During his decade-long career in the Army, Trenton was deployed 3 
times, completing a combat tour in Afghanistan and peace tours in 
Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. He also served with the 17th Field 
Artillery Brigade at Joint Base Lewis McChord, and served in roles 
that, in 10 years&#x27; time, increased in leadership responsibility, 
including team leader, squad leader, and platoon sergeant.
  After the Army, Trenton reentered the civilian workforce with an eye 
towards community-centered service--he soon found himself with the 
Tumwater Fire Department, where he continues to work as a firefighter. 
And his service doesn&#x27;t stop with fighting fires--he works to prepare 
and protect the community by teaching CPR and serving as an Emergency 
Medical Technician. Trenton is also pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
degree in Fire Service Administration at Eastern Oregon University, 
demonstrating his dedication to his own self-development as a public 
servant and emergency service professional.
  As Washington continues to face a fierce fire season, I thank Trenton 
for his selfless service to our community and our country.
