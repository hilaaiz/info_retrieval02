his leadership, has developed protocols mitigating health risks for 
students in high-impact sports.
  Dr. Breithaupt&#x27;s 50-year career exemplifies his passion for student 
success. Before working as Executive Director, Dr. Breithaupt served 17 
years as a public-school teacher, coach, athletic director, and

universities.
  Dr. Breithaupt&#x27;s numerous accolades include being named 1991 Texas

  I join Dr. Breithaupt&#x27;s family, friends, and colleagues in 
celebrating his unwavering dedication and contributions. His efforts 
reflect his outstanding leadership and commitment to fostering a legacy

  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Jimmy Donaldson, 
better known as MrBeast, a remarkable North Carolinian who has 
significantly impacted both the digital world and our local 
communities.
  Raised in Greenville, MrBeast has become one of the most influential 
figures in digital media while embodying the values of 
entrepreneurship, innovation, and philanthropy that drive North 
Carolina forward.
  MrBeast&#x27;s ventures, including the Team Trees and Team Seas campaigns, 
have drawn attention to critical environmental causes. Team Trees 
raised over $24 million to plant more than 24 million trees worldwide, 
and Team Seas collected over $30 million to remove 30 million pounds of 
trash from our oceans.
  His commitment to giving back is also seen through the MrBeast 
Philanthropy channel, which has delivered over a million meals to those 
in need across eastern North Carolina. These efforts have not only 
rallied millions of supporters but have set a new standard for global 
activism.
  With over 330 million YouTube subscribers and millions more on other 
platforms, MrBeast has turned his success into an opportunity to bring 
industry, jobs, and creativity to our state.
  I honor Jimmy Donaldson today not only for his entrepreneurial 
success but for his philanthropic endeavors and his efforts to create a 
more connected and inspired community.
  Please join me in recognizing Jimmy Donaldson for his contributions 
to North Carolina and beyond.

                                 ______

                       Monday, December 16, 2024

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, I along with the people of St. Louis, rise 
today to honor the extraordinary life of Esther Jean Hill Haywood, a 
trailblazer, educator, public servant, and unwavering advocate for 
civil rights and social justice. Born in Memphis, Tennessee on January 
15, 1940, Esther&#x27;s early commitment to service shaped a lifetime of 
transformational contributions to her community and our nation. She 
dedicated herself to fostering equity in education, leading initiatives 
for underserved youth, and tirelessly advocating for social

[[Page E1280]]

progress. Esther Haywood&#x27;s life exemplifies the power of purpose, 
passion, and perseverance.
  As an educator, Esther broke barriers in the Shelby County Public 
School System, becoming one of the first African-American teachers to 
integrate its classrooms in 1967. Her pioneering efforts set the stage 
for generations of students and educators who followed. Her passion for 
educational equity continued in East St. Louis, Illinois, where she 
dedicated over 27 years to uplifting young minds as a math specialist, 
an organizer of student trips to Washington, D.C., and a mentor to 
countless youth.
  Beyond education, Esther&#x27;s service extended to leadership in civic 
and community organizations. As President of the St. Louis County 
Branch of the NAACP, she reactivated and expanded its influence, 
earning national acclaim. Her tenure as a Missouri State Representative 
demonstrated her commitment to justice and equity through legislation 
combating hate crimes, advocating for educational funding, and 
commemorating the contributions of civil rights icons. Esther&#x27;s 
advocacy reached global audiences through her role as an Ambassador for 
Peace, reflecting her belief in the universal power of community and 
unity.
  Esther Haywood&#x27;s legacy is a testament to her boundless love for her 
family and community. Her devotion to her husband, Edward, their two 
daughters, and her grandchildren, exemplified the values of family, 
mentorship, and enduring strength. Her unparalleled contributions, 
whether in education, public service, or civil rights, will forever 
inspire those who follow in her footsteps. On behalf of Missouri&#x27;s 
First Congressional District, I am honored to celebrate the life of a 
truly remarkable woman who embodied the spirit of service and uplifted 
everyone around her.

                                 ______

                       Monday, December 16, 2024

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Grayford F. 
Payne on the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. Department of the 
Interior after 38 years of Federal service.
  Grayford Payne has spent his career serving the American people in a 
number of roles within the federal government. Shortly after graduating 
from George Mason University in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science in 
Accounting, Mr. Payne served as an Auditor-in-Charge in the Naval Audit 
Service. In this role, he was responsible for audit and program reviews 
of Department of Defense National Security Science and Technology 
programs.
  After eight years, Mr, Payne joined the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission where he served seven years as Director of Financial 
Services. During his time there, he was in charge of the Commission&#x27;s 
financial accounting system and its automated revenue billing and 
collection system.
  In 2002, he joined the Department of the Interior as the Deputy Chief 
Financial Officer for Indian Affairs where he was responsible for the 
day-to-day operations of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer 
which included all financial, accounting, budget, procurement, and 
property functions. He was promoted just three years later to the role 
of Chief Financial Officer and then again to the Acting Deputy 
Assistant Secretary-Management in 2008.
  There, he oversaw the planning and execution of the Indian Affairs 
$4.5 billion annual budget, and his organizational responsibilities 
encompassed all administrative functions to include finance, budget, 
acquisition, property management, human resources, homeland security, 
planning, audit and evaluation, and more.
  Mr. Payne moved to the Bureau of Reclamation within the U.S. 
Department of the Interior in 2010 and was named Reclamation&#x27;s Deputy 
Commissioner for Policy, Administration and Budget, a role he held 
until his retirement. He oversaw agency resources, policy formulation, 
finance, law enforcement, dam safety, program and budget, and more. He 
also served as Reclamation&#x27;s Chief Financial Officer.
  Throughout his public service, Mr. Payne received numerous awards for 
his dedication and leadership. He was honored with the Secretary of the 
Interior&#x27;s Gold Leadership Award in 2007, Bronze Leadership Award in 
2006, and Silver Leadership Award in 2005.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating 
Grayford F. Payne on his retirement. I am proud to represent Mr. Payne 
in Congress, and I thank him and his family, wife Sharon and children 
Robert, Katherine, Elizabeth, and Carolyn, for his honorable 38 years 
of service to our Nation.

                       Monday, December 16, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, I have the privilege of 
recognizing and celebrating Matthew Gleason for achieving the great 
rank of Eagle Scout after 13 years of steadfast commitment to the Scout 
Oath and Law. Matthew&#x27;s scouting career began as a Cub Scout in the 
fall of 2011, where he rapidly ascended to leadership roles, including 
Assistant Patrol Leader and Patrol Leader. Early on, he earned the 
prestigious Arrow of Light award, a testament to his dedication and 
hard work. Matthew&#x27;s commitment to community service has been nothing 
short of exemplary. He logged nearly 200 hours helping neighbors, 
friends, and strangers alike, demonstrating an inspiring dedication to 
those around him. In addition to his service, he has shown impressive 
physical fitness by completing a challenging 33-mile hike through 
rigorous terrain, successfully reaching every mission-required 
destination. For his Eagle Scout project, he dedicated over 160 hours 
to the Aura Volunteer Fire Company, where he built a shed for their 
antique fire truck, preserving

[[Page E1281]]

and honoring the department&#x27;s rich history. Beyond his scouting 
achievements, Matthew is a remarkable student. He has consistently made 
the honor roll ten times and has been recognized on the 
Superintendent&#x27;s List five times. As a standout soccer player, he has 
lettered three times at Delsea Regional High School and has earned a 
spot on the All-County team for all three years. Looking ahead, Matthew 
has clear and ambitious goals: he plans to pursue a degree in Civil 
Engineering and eventually establish his own engineering firm. In a 
beautiful full circle moment, inspired by the tremendous support he 
received from firefighters during his project, Matthew is determined to 
serve his community as a volunteer firefighter. I am confident that 
Matthew will excel in any path he chooses, and I eagerly anticipate the 
significant impact he will make in our world. May God bless Matthew and 
God bless our United States of America.

  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Michelle Hines on her 
retirement from 33 years of working in community service with the 
Barren River Area Development District (BRADD).
  A Logan County native, Michelle was born, raised, and resides in 
Auburn, Kentucky. After graduating from Logan County High School and 
Western Kentucky University, Michelle&#x27;s first job out of college was 
with the Barren River Area Development District. In her tenure, which 
spans over three decades, Michelle has been a faithful servant to her 
community, advocating and supporting citizens throughout the region she 
oversees. She has been part of many critical initiatives including 
supporting the 2021 Tornado Relief fund, countless food drives, and 
BRADD&#x27;s Veterans Directed Care Services expansion.
  Mrs. Hines can best be described by all who know her as devoted, 
humble, and ready to act. Her devotion throughout her career has 
inspired many people and enriched the lives of countless constituents.

                       Monday, December 16, 2024

  Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
class of interns who supported my office during the Fall 2024 term. 
Whether they were working in the bustling U.S. Capitol or amongst the 
cornfields of Illinois, their contributions to Illinois&#x27; 13th 
Congressional District have made a significant impact.
  In my Washington Office, I was honored to work alongside Daryl 
Salinas, Wedad Osman, Stella Linn, and Sophia Hinich. These four 
interns have worked tirelessly to support my staff, skillfully 
navigating the complexities of working on Capitol Hill. They have been 
instrumental in managing direct correspondence with our constituents, 
drafting numerous memos and letters, and assisting with in-depth policy 
research. I am especially grateful for their work in preparing my 
office to transition to the 119th Congress.
  Back in Illinois, I was honored to work with Avery Martin in my 
Champaign Office. Her commitment to constituent service by assisting my 
casework team has been tremendous, and I applaud her for the dedication 
she showed to the people of Central and Southern Illinois while also 
being a full-time student at the University of Illinois.
  The impact that these five individuals left in my office will be felt 
for years to come as we transition to the 119th Congress, and we will 
be very sad to say farewell to this spectacular group of interns. I 
thank Daryl, Wedad, Stella, Sophia, and Avery for their service. I wish 
them all the best as they continue their professional and academic 
journeys.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, December 16, 2024

  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the extraordinary 
career and service of Mary L. Adams, who has tirelessly dedicated 
herself to the people of Monterey County. Today, at her last meeting of 
the Big Sur Multi-Agency Advisory Council, and upon her well-earned 
retirement, it is fitting to honor her leadership and enduring 
contributions to our community.
  Mary L. Adams has served with distinction as the Fifth District 
Supervisor for the County of Monterey, skillfully navigating numerous 
complex challenges with compassion and foresight. Her accomplishments 
exemplify a lifetime of hard work and community dedication.
  Mary played a vital role in leading Monterey County through major 
emergencies, including multiple atmospheric river events and wildfires 
such as the Soberanes, River, Carmel, Dolan, and Palo Colorado fires. 
Her leadership in organizing efforts, like the Big Sur Helicopter 
Commodity Drop, provided critical support to isolated communities, 
ensuring the safety and resilience of residents during these crises.
  She has been instrumental in addressing key local challenges, 
including coordination during the Pfeiffer Bridge repairs, implementing 
safety measures along Highway 1 near Point Lobos State Park and the 
Bixby Creek Bridge, and overseeing the Scenic Road Carmel Lagoon 
Environmental Impact Report. Each of these efforts has significantly 
contributed to the preservation of Monterey County&#x27;s natural beauty and 
infrastructure.
  Mary&#x27;s leadership in infrastructure improvements has also been 
transformative. She spearheaded upgrades to Carmel Valley Road and 
played a key role as Chair of the Carmel Valley Road Advisory 
Committee, culminating in the finalization of the Carmel Valley Road 
and Laureles Grade Roundabout project.
  A steadfast advocate for housing solutions, Mary worked tirelessly to 
update the Vacation Rental Ordinance, protect neighborhood character, 
and champion sustainable, long-term housing initiatives. Under her 
leadership, the County invested in the Monterey Bay Economic 
Partnership Housing Trust Fund, unlocking millions in funding for 
affordable housing projects. She also supported innovative public-
private partnerships and employer-sponsored housing initiatives, while 
prioritizing the community&#x27;s best interests in updating the Housing 
Element.
  During the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mary 
provided steady and compassionate leadership, ensuring critical 
resources reached those in need. Her advocacy extended to sustainable 
water solutions, supporting the passage of Measure J for public water 
ownership and hosting Regional Water Forums to engage the community on 
pressing water challenges.
  Throughout her tenure, Mary has exemplified transparency and 
accountability in governance. Her instrumental role in the hiring of 
key county officials, including the County Administrative Officer and 
County Counsel, has strengthened the foundation for Monterey County&#x27;s 
future success.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the career 
and accomplishments of Mary L. Adams. Her legacy of leadership and 
dedication to the people of Monterey County will inspire generations to 
come. We thank her for her service and wish her the very best in her 
well-deserved retirement.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, December 16, 2024

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Brian 
Johnson and Caroline Reynolds on the occasion of their engagement. It 
is with great pleasure and excitement that I share the wonderful news.
  Brian, a steadfast friend and dedicated professional, has been a true 
partner in our work with Veterans Guardian, helping countless veterans 
across the Nation achieve their well-deserved disability rating 
increases.
  Fate brought Brian and his incredible fiance, Caroline Reynolds, 
together at the U.S. Open during an event hosted by our mutual friend 
and colleague, Congressman Richard Hudson. Their story reached a 
beautiful milestone over the Thanksgiving holiday on November 26, when 
Brian proposed to Caroline in her charming hometown of Nacogdoches, 
Texas. The engagement was a heartwarming celebration, surrounded by 
family, friends, and joyous festivities.
  Love and marriage represent the joining of two hearts and lives, 
built on a foundation of trust, respect, and shared dreams. Brian and 
Caroline embody the promise to stand together through life&#x27;s joys and 
challenges, growing stronger as individuals and as partners. Their love 
story is a testament to the beauty of finding someone who not only 
inspires you but also walks beside you every step of the way.
  Mr. Speaker, let us all join in congratulating Brian and Caroline on 
this exciting new chapter in their lives. I wish them boundless 
happiness, love, and success as they embark on their journey together.

                          ____________________
