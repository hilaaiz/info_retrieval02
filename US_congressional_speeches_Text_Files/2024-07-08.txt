          CELEBRATING FRANK CHARLES BIELECKI&#x27;S 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, July 8, 2024

  Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of my 
constituent, Frank Charles Bielecki, who turns 100 years old on August 
28th of this year. Mr. Bielecki has dedicated his life to our country, 
his family, and Michiganders.
  Bielecki served in the United States Army for three years, where he 
worked as a Private and Tec 5 Cook at Fort Custer in Michigan. Bielecki 
spent 60 wonderful years with his wife Dorothy Joan Kulak, and he is a 
proud father to three sons, a grandfather of seven, and a great 
grandfather of eleven. Before retiring in 1986, he worked at Rapistan 
Conveyors in Grand Rapids for over 31 years.
  When asked about his secret to longevity, Bielecki recalls always 
working hard, staying healthy, and eating plenty of Vernors and Little 
Debbie Honey Buns. From raising generations of Michiganders to serving 
our country, Bielecki has inspired so many people across the Third 
District. I applaud the positive impact he continues to make in our 
West Michigan community.
  Mr. Speaker, once more I ask my colleagues to join me in commending 
Mr. Bielecki for his lifelong commitment to family, community, and 
service; and to Mr. Bielecki, I wish him another happy, healthy, and 
fulfilling year ahead.

                          ____________________

     DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND RELATED PROGRAMS 
                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2025

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. GWEN MOORE

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 26, 2024

  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my 
amendment No. 44--which has been included in the En Bloc amendment--to 
help ensure that the U.S. remains focused on helping to end female 
genital mutilation around the world at a time when some countries are 
considering repealing existing bans.
  Female genital mutilation (FGM) involves procedures that alter or 
injure the female genitalia for non-medical reasons and is recognized 
internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women.
  As the person who led efforts to outlaw female genital mutilation in 
the State of Wisconsin, I am too keenly aware that this remains a 
pressing issue.
  More than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone 
female genital mutilation. And it is estimated that 4.4 million girls 
are at risk of experiencing this harmful practice this year alone.
  This is a practice that has no health benefits but harms girls and 
women.
  I share concerns that have been raised about the overall funding 
levels in this bill that have been so well articulated and the deep 
cuts to a range of programs that are vital to our Nation&#x27;s interest and 
national security efforts.
  I am also troubled by a number of policy riders that have been 
inserted into this bill. The bill defunds agencies like the UN 
Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) that have been working to address female 
genital mutilation for years. Agencies like the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) that have also been engaged in helping to move 
the world towards the elimination of this practice. The Department of 
State has annually provided about $5 million to UNICEF to support a 
Joint Programme on the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation.
  While we have not yet eliminated the practice of FGM, our investments 
and those of our international partners have seen results. As noted by 
the UN, over the last three decades, the prevalence of FGM has declined 
globally.
  It wasn&#x27;t by accident.
  It took hard work by dedicated partners at all levels from the 
international community to the local community working to reframe laws 
and attitudes.
  But the work must continue.
  For example, the parliament in The Gambia is considering repealing 
the FGM ban enacted in that country in 2015.
  The repeal campaign began after the government dared to actually 
enforce the law a few years ago.
  Overall, there is concern that if The Gambia repeals its law, this 
could inspire other countries to do likewise.
  But more importantly, is what it would mean for the women and girls 
in Gambia, where some estimated that up to three-quarters of the women 
and girls have undergone the procedure.
  In February of this year, when the world commemorated the 
International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, our 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, ``FGM, in all forms, is a Human 
rights abuse that harms all women.&#x27;&#x27;
  We cannot rollback the U.S. commitment to ending this human rights 
abuse and that includes ensuring that we adequately fund these efforts.
  Our commitment to eliminating FGM--working with international 
organizations, such as UNICEF and UNFPA, coUntries, survivors, and 
other stakeholders--will only go as deep as our resources take it. My 
amendment would send a message that we still think this is important 
even in a bill that makes harmful cuts across the board to development, 
diplomacy, and humanitarian assistance.
  I urge support.

 HONORING KAREN ST. HILAIRE FOR HER SERVICE AND DEDICATION TO VETERANS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. CLAUDIA TENNEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, July 8, 2024

  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Karen St. Hilaire, 
President of the New York American Legion Auxiliary, and her work with 
the Hope For The Warriors project.
  Karen St. Hilaire is a 49-year member of the Mattydale American 
Legion Auxiliary Unit No. 1832 in Onondaga County. She became a member 
through her father John Allen who served in World War Two. Her late 
husband Jerry Hilaire was also a Veteran in the Army who served in 
Vietnam.
  Karen&#x27;s leadership skill began as Unit President in 1999 progressing 
to County in 2008, and District in 2011. She has chaired the Community 
Service, Americanism, Leadership, Children and Youth, VA&amp;R, Membership 
Committees, and as an Executive Board member.
  Karen has been spending her year promoting and raising money for the 
``Hope For The Warriors,&#x27;&#x27; Hope For The Warriors was founded by 
military families aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, NC in 2006 as 
they witnessed, firsthand, the effects war imparts on service members 
and their families. Hope For the Warriors believes those touched by 
military service can succeed at home by restoring their sense of self, 
family, and hope.

[[Page E698]]

  Nationally, Hope For The Warriors provides comprehensive support 
programs for service members, veterans, and military families that are 
focused on transition, health and wellness, peer engagement, and 
connections to community resources.
  Hope For The Warriors understands the challenges, pride, and joy of 
being a military family. For today, tomorrow, and years to come, they 
will strive to meet the changing needs of service members and their 
families. Hope For The Warriors is a family, united by our shared 
conviction of honor and sacrifice. In Karen&#x27;s personal life, she is 
active in her community as a retired Firefighter and currently elected 
Fire Commissioner for Hinsdale Volunteer Fire Department. Karen is a 
retired Registered Nurse with a certification from American Association 
of Critical Care Nurses.
  Karen has often sited that her greatest accomplishment is that she 
and her late husband Jerry have two daughters, Amy and Kristin, along 
with six grandchildren, Ariana, Emyrson, Ayva, Camryn, Brooklyn, and 
Dylan.
  I am honored to share the admirable work that Mrs. Hilaire has 
devoted to helping care for our Veterans.

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of St. 
Louis to celebrate the 80th birthday of Mrs. Martha Ann Sanders.
  Eighty years is a remarkable milestone and worthy of great

between, are a beautiful testament to a remarkable life.
  As we honor and celebrate her birthday, I would like to recognize 
Mrs. Sanders&#x27; family and friends who are celebrating this milestone 
occasion. Mrs. Sanders&#x27; unwavering strength and profound love for her 
family is evident and today serves as a reminder of the impact she has 
had on her family and broader community.
  On behalf of Missouri&#x27;s First Congressional District, I wish Mrs. 
Martha Ann Sanders peace, blessings, and a joyous start to her 80th 
year.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, July 8, 2024

  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable 
career and leadership of Stella Whitney-West, who is retiring after 17 
years as Chief Executive Officer of NorthPoint Health and Wellness 
Center in Minneapolis.
  NorthPoint, one of my district&#x27;s Federally Qualified Health Centers, 
serves thousands of my constituents every year, Federally Qualified 
Health Centers make up the fabric of our country&#x27;s health safety net--
and Ms. Whitney-West&#x27;s leadership has been instrumental in making 
NorthPoint a shining example of the FQHC model. In fact, it should be 
noted that NorthPoint was the first FQHC to be designated as a Health 
Care Home by the Minnesota Department of Public Health. Ms. Whitney-
West began her career at NorthPoint as Chief Operating Officer in 2004. 
When she became the Chief Executive Officer in 2007, she led NorthPoint 
through a transitional time of several renovations and expansions to 
better serve our community. Throughout Ms. Whitney-West&#x27;s tenure, she 
and her staff have prioritized fostering partnerships with other 
organizations throughout the city to expand their reach of care. 
NorthPoint&#x27;s role in serving our community during the COVID-19 pandemic 
is immeasurable. Under Ms. Whitney-West&#x27;s steadfast leadership, 
NorthPoint was a cornerstone of health and wellness for those who 
needed it most; not only by providing critical care and information, 
but also access to countless other resources like food and housing 
support. The positive impact that NorthPoint has on my district cannot 
be overstated, and it is thanks in large part to Stella Whitney-West&#x27;s 
incredible leadership.
  Ms. Whitney-West has spent the last 20 years at NorthPoint deeply 
committed to improving the lives of those in and around Minneapolis. 
She has also served on the boards of Minnesota Association of Community 
Health Centers, and the African American Leadership Forum. While Ms. 
Whitney-West will be truly missed at NorthPoint, I am sure that the 
strong foundation she built will ensure NorthPoint&#x27;s long-term success 
and positive role in our community for generations to come. Ms. 
Whitney-West&#x27;s leadership and dedication to public health is 
invaluable--her life&#x27;s work serving others has made Minneapolis a 
healthier, more equitable place for all.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege to honor and thank Stella 
Whitney-West for her distinguished career and faithful service to our 
community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIRNESS IN FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS MEDICAL CARE 
                              ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, July 8, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Fairness in Federal 
Bureau of Prisons Medical Care Act of 2024. This bill would eliminate 
the copay the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) imposes on individuals in 
its custody when they visit a health care provider.
  Under BOP rules, individuals in its custody are required to ``pay a 
fee for health services of $2.00 per health care visit.&#x27;&#x27; While $2 may 
seem insignificant, when such individuals earn only twelve to forty 
cents per hour on their work assignments, $2 is substantial. That money 
could better be used to pay for the cost of necessities. Moreover, 
while copays can reduce unnecessary appointments, we should be 
encouraging such individuals to seek medical care before their 
conditions become worse and more expensive for taxpayers. Early care is 
better for patients and much less expensive for the federal government 
than costly treatments that could have been avoided by a simple health 
care visit earlier in the process.
  Under BOP rules, if an individual in BOP custody is found responsible 
through the Disciplinary Hearing Process of having caused an injury to 
another person in BOP custody that required a visit to a health care 
provider, the offending individual is required to pay the $2 copay for 
the injured individual&#x27;s visit. That rule would not change under this 
bill.
  Removing this unnecessary copay would encourage early treatment and 
would save the federal government money.

[[Page E699]]

  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          Monday, July 8, 2024

  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Berea Citizen, a 
newspaper in Kentucky&#x27;s Sixth District. The Berea Citizen was founded 
in 1899. It has been a trusted news source for the people of Madison 
County for 125 years.
  The idea for the newspaper originated with Berea College President 
William G. Frost and at first it served as the school newspaper. It 
remained connected with Berea College until 1984, when it became a 
private newspaper. It was first delivered on Chestnut Street along a 
dirt road. The newspaper survived the Great Depression, two World Wars, 
and a global pandemic, delivering local news to the community without 
interruption.
  The Berea Citizen staff recognizes that freedom of the press is 
critical in our society. They prioritize fair and balanced coverage of 
local meetings and events. The Berea Citizen reached more than 10,000 
readers each week. They are currently owned by Nolan Group Media from 
Manchester, Kentucky. Keith Taylor, the publisher, began in 2020 as the 
pandemic was beginning. The owner is Jay Nolan, and the Vice President 
is Glenn Gray. The Berea Citizen is one of the few locally owned 
newspapers in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and it is printed in 
Kentucky at J. Frank Publishing in London, Kentucky.
  In an era when many community newspapers are declining and no longer 
able to print news for the citizens, The Berea Citizen continues its 
mission to be a voice in the community. I congratulate them on their 
125-year anniversary, and I am honored to recognize them before the 
United States Congress.

           TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF NARSAI MICHAEL DAVID

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANNA G. ESHOO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, July 8, 2024

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of an 
extraordinary American, Narsai Michael David.
  Narsai David, the child of Assyrian immigrants, was born in South 
Bend, Indiana on June 26, 1936 and grew up in Turlock, California. He 
died in his home in Berkeley on June 20, 2024 from injuries suffered as 
a result of a fall.
  Narsai David graduated from Turlock High School and the University of 
California, Berkeley, where he studied math and pre-med. He worked in a 
restaurant during college and after owning a printing company for two 
years, he worked at a restaurant in Berkeley where he eventually became 
a partner. In 1970 he launched a catering business and one of his first 
clients, rock impresario Bill Graham, introduced him to many of the 
legends of the era.
  In 1976 Narsai opened his eponymous restaurant in Kensington, 
California, and was in the vanguard of the food revolution of the 
1970&#x27;s. He also owned a vineyard in the Napa Valley where he produced 
Cuvee and Cabernet Sauvignon.
  Narsai David&#x27;s inviting smile, warm voice and passion for food and 
travel made him a widely beloved and highly regarded writer of a 
cooking column in the San Francisco Chronicle and commentator on KCBS 
radio and television for many years.
  Reminiscing about Narsai, his colleagues at KCBS remember his 
signature bow ties, and how he would begin with ``I&#x27;m Narsai David to 
say . . . .&#x27;&#x27; and launch into his news reports. He never said anything 
negative on the radio or television about a restaurant or chef, and 
when he was hosting a dinner he would tinkle his fork on a glass and 
say ``good evening, good evening and a very good evening,&#x27;&#x27; all with a 
sparkle in his eye.
  Narsai was a generous philanthropist who was affiliated with the 
Assyrian Aid Society of America and Alameda County&#x27;s Meals on Wheels 
program. His pride in being an Assyrian American was evident to all, 
and his gourmet enterprises all reflected the culture.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring the life of a great and good man, Narsai David, and in 
extending our most sincere condolences to his wife Venus and his son 
Daniel. We are a better Nation because of this exceptional man who was 
a dear friend and mentor to me.

                          ____________________
