              HONORING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF DR. NITIN SHAH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 3, 2023

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of 
Dr. Nitin Shah, a compassionate and dedicated physician whose 
unwavering commitment to the well-being of his community has had a 
profound and lasting impact on the lives of thousands of individuals.
  Dr. Nitin Shah&#x27;s journey began in 1975, where he began his rotating 
medical internship in Vadodara, India before migrating to New York. 
There, he continued his career as a research fellow--and eventually 
moved to the City of Anaheim and continued to provide medical care as 
an anesthesiologist.
  In 2006, Dr. Shah&#x27;s deep sense of empathy and vision for a healthier 
and more equitable society led him to establish the Anaheim Free Health 
Clinic and Citizenship Fair, an event that provides free medical, 
dental, vision, and other health care services to Anaheim residents 
with the help of countless doctors and volunteers. Recognizing the 
pressing need for

accessible healthcare in our community, he made it his life&#x27;s mission 
to provide quality medical care to those who were underserved and often 
overlooked.
  From humble beginnings, the clinic has developed into a cornerstone 
of community health, with an impact that extends far beyond the 
facility&#x27;s walls. Countless lives have been changed because of his 
efforts. Families that could not previously afford crucial health 
visits now have access to these services. Children get the vaccinations 
they need to stay healthy, and those with chronic illnesses get the 
continuing care and assistance they need to manage their ailments. His 
tireless commitment to providing free health care services to those in 
need exemplifies the values of compassion, selflessness, and service.
  Mr. Speaker, I call upon my fellow members of Congress to join me in 
recognizing the incredible work of Dr. Shah.
