  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
90th birthday of Mrs. Lessie Sylveen Poindexter Crosby, a beacon of 
light in the City of Buffalo. Mrs. Poindexter Crosby&#x27;s life story is a 
beautiful tapestry woven with love and resilience.
  Born September 7, 1935, in Buffalo, New York, to Issac Costello and 
Fannie Sue Poindexter Johnson. Mrs. Poindexter Crosby was raised to 
inspire everyone she met with her selflessness and compassion. Over the 
years, she has witnessed many changes in her life and community, yet 
her love for those around her has remained a constant source of 
strength. Mrs. Poindexter Crosby has consistently demonstrated 
Christian principles as a community member and spiritual leader in the 
Women&#x27;s Ministry at First Shiloh Baptist Church.
  Mrs. Poindexter Crosby&#x27;s most rewarding roles have been those of a 
dedicated wife, mother, and grandmother. In 1953, Mrs. Poindexter 
Crosby married the late Mr. Excel Crosby. Their loving union blessed 
them with four community-minded children--Julie, Gary, Bridgett, and 
Lisa. Together, they built a home filled with love, respect, and 
responsibility.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Mrs. Poindexter Crosby, a 
woman of poise and resilience, whose influence extends beyond her 
beloved family and community. On this milestone birthday, we celebrate 
her extraordinary life, her enduring legacy, and the profound impact 
she has made on all who know her.

                       Friday, September 26, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the people of 
Ukraine and Ukrainian communities around the world in celebrating 
Ukrainian Independence Day, observed annually on August 24th. It 
acknowledges a day of triumph and persistence through the courage and 
unity of the Ukrainian people.
  On August 24, 1991, members of the Ukrainian Parliament replaced the 
red and blue flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic with the current 
blue and yellow Ukrainian flag following a failed coup in the Soviet 
Union. In response, pro-democracy leaders chose to push for Ukraine&#x27;s 
Independence despite the risks--truly living up to their historic motto 
``Come what may.&#x27;&#x27;
  Ukrainian Independence Day is celebrated with a national address and 
flag-raising ceremony in Kyiv by the President of Ukraine, followed by 
military parades, cultural performances, and patriotic songs. The blue 
and yellow Ukrainian flag is proudly displayed across the country and 
in Ukrainian communities around the world. It is a day of national 
pride and reflection, where citizens honor the struggles of their 
ancestors, celebrate their sovereignty, and express solidarity with 
Ukrainians everywhere.
  As we celebrate Ukrainian Independence Day, let us acknowledge and 
celebrate the sacrifices made by the countless brave souls and citizens 
who fought for a future of liberty and independence. Let us also take 
this moment to recognize the vibrant Ukrainian-American community 
throughout our country. Their cultural contributions enrich our nation, 
and we are all the better for it.

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Matt Yeakley, and 
his wife Morgan, for their extraordinary service and leadership during 
the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Marshall, North Carolina.
  When Hurricane Helene struck, downtown Marshall was left heavily 
damaged, with streets blocked, buildings impacted, and the community in 
urgent need of coordination and support. From the very first morning 
after the storm, Matt and Morgan stepped forward without hesitation to 
organize and lead the town&#x27;s volunteer cleanup efforts. Matt focused on 
heavy equipment and debris cleanup, while Morgan coordinated volunteers 
and addressed medical needs.
  Drawing on their leadership skills and deep knowledge of the 
community, Matt and Morgan quickly established a volunteer coordination 
hub in front of the courthouse. They identified critical areas needing 
attention, organized volunteers into specialized teams, and ensured 
every person, local or visiting, had a meaningful role to play in the 
recovery.
  Their calm demeanor and logistical efficiency transformed a chaotic 
and uncertain situation into a coordinated, effective response. The 
safety and productivity of every cleanup crew were always a priority. 
Volunteers from across the region praised Matt and his wife for their 
clarity, professionalism, and kindness.
  Thanks to their tireless efforts, downtown Marshall was cleared and 
stabilized within days, allowing businesses owners and residents to 
access their properties and begin their own recovery efforts.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our 
appreciation to Matt and Morgan Yeakley as their dedication, humility, 
and leadership during this time of crisis exemplify the very best of 
community service.

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary 
service and leadership of Madison County&#x27;s Ms. Deanna Ponder in the 
immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
  When Hurricane Helene devastated our communities, access to fuel was 
critical to sustaining emergency operations. Without hesitation, Ms. 
Ponder stepped forward to operate the Madison County School Bus Garage 
fueling station, ensuring that first responders could continue their 
vital work.
  For 17 days following the storm, Ms. Ponder personally managed the 
fueling of essential vehicles and equipment including firetrucks, 
ambulances, county maintenance vehicles, law enforcement fleets, and 
mobile command centers. She gave tireless effort to her community, 
delivering more than 20,000 gallons of fuel to power generators 
supporting light towers, shower camps established by Samaritan&#x27;s Purse,

kept recovery efforts moving day and night, under challenging 
conditions, and provided a lifeline for the community when it was 
needed most.

calm presence, and unwavering commitment inspired those around her. 
First responders and volunteers repeatedly praised her clarity, 
efficiency, and selfless dedication. Through her efforts, she helped 
create an organized and reliable system that allowed others to focus on 
saving lives, restore essential services, and begin the process of 
rebuilding.
  Her actions serve as a powerful reminder that leadership is not 
always about holding a title, but it is about stepping forward, 
recognizing a need, and acting with courage and compassion. Madison 
County, and all of Western North Carolina, are stronger today because 
of her extraordinary efforts.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest 
appreciation of Ms. Ponder&#x27;s outstanding service and unwavering 
dedication to her community. Her service embodies the very best of 
resiliency, selflessness. and dedication in the face of disaster, and 
she stands as an inspiring example for us all.

            HONORING MS. HATTIE WHITE ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 26, 2025

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my heartfelt 
birthday wishes to Ms. Hattie White as she celebrates her remarkable 
100th birthday. Born in 1925, she lived in the vibrant Bedford 
Stuyvesant community in Brooklyn, New York. A community known for its 
rich African American heritage, social activism, and brownstone homes 
that reflected the pride of homeownership among neighbors. In fact, at 
a time when homeownership was not easily attainable, Ms. White owned a 
home where she provided her seven children with a stable and nurturing 
environment.
  Ms. Hattie lived a life characterized by hard work, resilience, 
adaptability, and faith. Her life spanned historical events in our 
society, from the Great Depression, World War II, to the Civil Rights 
Movement, the cultural shifts of the 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s and the 
advancements in technology. These events shaped her experiences and 
perspectives, further strengthening her resolve.
  In addition to her family, Ms. Hattie has been and remains a devoted 
member of the Zion Shiloh Baptist Church. Her unwavering faith and 
commitment to the church community have made her a beloved figure among 
her fellow congregants. She is a respected elder of the church who is 
renowned for her years of leadership roles, community service, and 
guiding her congregation. Her compassion and generosity have touched 
the lives of many in Brooklyn, making her a true beacon of hope and 
inspiration.
  Ms. Hattie White exemplifies a remarkable legacy of longevity, 
resilience and a proud spirit of service. She is cherished by her 
family and friends, who are deeply grateful for her unconditional love 
and friendship.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Hattie White, one of 
our Nation&#x27;s Centenarians, on this special occasion of her 100th year 
birthday.

 HONORING PHILLIP ARROYO AS A DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA 
                      FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DARREN SOTO

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 26, 2025

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Phillip Arroyo is a distinguished attorney, 
advocate, and proud Puerto Rican whose life reflects a lifelong 
dedication to justice. Born in 1982 on a United States military base in 
Germany to a Puerto Rican father who served in the Armed Forces, he was 
raised with the values of resilience, service, and courage. From 2009 
to 2012, Mr. Arroyo served as special assistant to the Puerto Rico 
Secretary of State, Kenneth McClintock, and in the Puerto Rico Senate. 
He later addressed the international community, twice testifying before 
the United Nations in New York City on the island&#x27;s unequal political 
status within the United States. In 2012, he was selected from 
thousands of applicants nationwide to serve as a White House intern 
under President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration, where he worked in the 
office of then-Vice President Joe Biden, analyzing domestic policy.
  Following his graduation from Florida A&amp;M University College of Law, 
Mr. Arroyo chose to serve as a public defender, representing the poor 
and ensuring the constitutional rights of the most vulnerable were 
protected. In 2022, he transitioned into private practice, co-founding 
the Arroyo Law Firm in Orlando, Florida, with his wife and law partner, 
Josephine Arroyo. Under their leadership, the firm has become one of 
Central Florida&#x27;s most respected criminal defense and immigration 
practices, recognized for zealous advocacy, service to underserved 
communities, and its particular commitment to assisting the Hispanic 
community.
  In addition, Mr. Arroyo is a frequent commentator in both national 
and local media on issues of criminal justice, immigration, and civil 
rights. While many in the legal community have remained silent, he has 
consistently spoken up in defense of our Constitution and immigrant 
communities during these dark times.
  His journey--from Puerto Rico to the United Nations, to the White 
House, and now to the courtroom--stands as a testament to perseverance, 
courage, and the enduring power of advocacy in the pursuit of justice 
for all.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 26, 2025

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Fina Bazan of 
Rio Grande City, who, after 48 years of service at the local Dairy 
Queen, has retired.
  For nearly half a century, Fina has been a familiar and welcoming 
face to countless families and neighbors.
  Though she may not always recall every name, she has always 
remembered the faces of those she served, treating each with warmth and 
kindness.
  Her dedication to her work and her community is an inspiration, and 
her story is one I hold close. My very first job as a young man was 
also at a Dairy Queen.
  I know firsthand the hard work and commitment it takes, and I deeply 
admire Fina&#x27;s devotion over these many decades.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Fina for her 
service, congratulating her on her well-earned retirement, and wishing 
her many years of health and happiness ahead.

                       Friday, September 26, 2025

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of 
Officer Karl Haugen, who passed away recently while off-duty.
  As early as high school, Karl expressed an interest in becoming a 
first responder. After attending the Law Enforcement Program at 
Alexandria Technical College and earning his Bachelor&#x27;s Degree from 
Mankato State University, he began his public service career, working 
at the Minnesota Forensic Hospital in St. Peter. He later worked at the 
MN Correctional Facility--Faribault and served for two years as 
Henderson Chief of Police.
  In 2008, he became an officer with the Le Sueur Police Department. 
Officer Haugen was well-known in the community for his humor, 
generosity, and compassionate approach to law enforcement. Despite the 
challenges and sacrifices of rural policing, he remained dedicated to 
public service and demonstrated a talent for seeing the good in people.
  I offer my deepest condolences to Officer Haugen&#x27;s family--his wife, 
Morgan, and his young children, Griffin, Aurora, and Teddy, and I thank 
him and the entire Le Sueur Police Department for their service to our 
community.

  RECOGNIZING THE SEMICENTENNIAL OF THE WOOD COUNTY COMMITTEE ON AGING

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT E. LATTA

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 26, 2025

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Semicentennial 
of the Wood County Committee on Aging. For five decades, the Committee 
has been dedicated to service, community, and care for all seniors in 
Wood County. The hard work and spirit shown by staff at the Committee 
have made it possible for countless older adults to remain independent 
and improve their quality of life.
  Founded in 1975, the Wood County Committee on Aging was established 
to provide comprehensive services to the county&#x27;s seniors. These 
services have grown over the decades to include programs for home-
delivered meals, medical transportation, health and wellness 
initiatives, caregiver support, and much more. With senior centers 
across the county, the Committee has been able to help elderly adults 
and their families navigate the challenges that can arise while aging.
  Mr. Speaker, by celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Wood 
County Committee on Aging, the county can recognize the outstanding 
achievements of the staff and pride the patrons have for their senior 
centers. I congratulate the Committee on Aging on this momentous 
milestone. I thank them for all they do for our county&#x27;s seniors.
