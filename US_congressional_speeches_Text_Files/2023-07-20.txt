                                 ______

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 20, 2023

  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. James Prochaska. 
James (Jim) O. Prochaska was an internationally renowned expert on 
behavior change and co-developer of the transtheoretical (stages of 
change) model that revolutionized our prevention and treatment of 
health problems. He died on July 9, 2023, after a special week with 
family and friends on Star Island.
  Born on August 6, 1942, into modest surroundings, Dr. Prochaska 
achieved the American Dream of education, excellence, and service. He 
earned his baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctorate in clinical 
psychology from Wayne State University. He was a Professor of 
Psychology at the University of Rhode Island from 1969 and founding 
Director of the Cancer Prevention Research Consortium there. Dr. 
Prochaska had over 50 years of psychotherapy experience in a variety of 
settings and consulted to a host of clinical and research 
organizations. He was the principal investigator on grants from the 
National. Institutes of Health totaling over $90 mill ion and was 
recognized by the Association of Psychological Science as one of the 
most cited authors in psychology.
  His 50 book chapters and 300+ scholarly articles focused on self-
change, health promotion, and psychotherapy from a transtheoretical 
perspective, the subject of his professional book, The Transtheoretical 
Approach, and his 2 popular self-help books, Changing for Good and 
Changing to Thrive. An accomplished speaker, he offered workshops and 
keynote addresses throughout the world.
  Among his numerous awards were the Rosalie Weiss Award from the 
American Psychological Association, Innovators Award from the Robert 
Wood Johnson Foundation, Beckham Award for Excellence in Education and 
Inspirational Leadership from Columbia University, and the Fries Health 
Education Award from the Society for Public Health Education.
  He was the first psychologist to win a Medal of Honor for Clinical 
Research from the American Cancer Society and he was recognized as one 
of the top 3 preeminent clinical psychologists of the modern era in the 
Archives of Scientific Psychology.
  Dr. Prochaska&#x27;s ultimate accomplishments, however, were helping 
millions of people effectively change their behavior and establishing 
his loving family. For decades, Jim made his home in Rhode Island 
before retiring to California with his wife, Jan, so that they could be 
closer to their 2 children (Jason, Judith/Jodi) and their 5 
grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in honoring Dr. James Prochaska.

     HONORING FRANCES METCALF ON THE OCCASION OF HER 99TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 20, 2023

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Frances Metcalf, 
who will be celebrating the milestone of her 99th birthday tomorrow. It 
is a distinct honor to pay tribute to Frances, who like many other 
women made substantial contributions to the war effort during World War 
II.
  IN 1943, Frances worked tirelessly to earn a job at one of the 
General Motors plants in East Cleveland, Ohio. There, she assisted in 
manufacturing air duct assemblies for over 75 Boeing B-29 Superfortress 
aircrafts which were crucial to U.S. military operations for over 20 
years. She worked there until she was old enough to serve in women&#x27;s 
branch of the United States Naval Reserve.
  In 1944, the recruitment age for all female volunteers was 20 years 
old. That same year, Frances turned 20--and shortly thereafter, she 
enlisted to serve as a naval nurse in Brooklyn, New York. Many `Rosie 
the Riveters&#x27; followed the same route in service to the homefront, and 
ultimately, were integral to U.S. victory.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and 
honoring Frances Metcalf on her 99th birthday. I am beyond proud to 
serve her in Congress and to have her in our community. The crucial 
contributions of her and many other women should never be forgotten in 
our community.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LAMBORN

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 20, 2023

  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor the life and legacy 
of Dr. Milton Carlyle Dewhirst, MD, who died of natural causes February 
13, 2023, at the age of 89. Dr. Dewhirst was not only a pillar of the 
Pike&#x27;s Peak region as a successful and generous family practice doctor 
and medical examiner, his faith and zeal for the Lord were foundational 
for the spiritual climate in Colorado Springs and set a model for 
family values and Christian citizenship. Dr. Milton Dewhirst truly 
helped make the culture of the 5th Congressional District as beautiful 
as our natural surroundings.
  After graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1954 and 
from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas in 1958, Dr. Dewhirst 
completed his Medical Internship at the Balboa Naval Hospital in San 
Diego, California. He then received flight training in Pensacola, 
Florida, followed by service as a Senior Aviation Medical Examiner at 
the U.S. Naval Air Station. Brunswick, Maine.
  In 1963, as a Diplomat of American Board of Family Practice, Dr. 
Dewhirst began a solo family medical practice. In 1972 he founded 
Family Practice Associates PC. He also treated patients at Penrose, 
Memorial, and Saint Francis Hospitals. Many Colorado Springs families 
were blessed to have Dr. Dewhirst as their life-long Family Doctor--
from delivering their babies to treating the elderly. After 43 years, 
he retired from Family Practice in 2001 and continued as an FAA Senior 
Medical Examiner until 2019.
  Dr. Dewhirst was not only a family doctor, but a devoted family man. 
He married his high school sweetheart LaBerta Phillips on August 6, 
1954. They were married for 68 years. Together, the Dewhirsts raised 5 
children--Debra Rayburn, Rebecca Lathrop, Miles Dewhirst, Angela 
Simmons, and Christine Van Raaphorst. Their legacy continues with 15 
grandchildren and 29 great grandchildren. Milton&#x27;s commitment to 
marriage and family extended into his service as an Elder at Village 
Seven Presbyterian Church, where he was active in teaching Bible 
Studies and Evangelism.
  At a time when families and marriages in our culture are struggling 
at heeding the words of Jesus, that ``a wise man build his house upon a 
rock.&#x27;&#x27; Dr. and Mrs. Dewhirst blessed Colorado Springs as a model and 
mentor for families instilling Biblical values and consistency in 
serving medical, spiritual, and relational needs. The Dewhirst legacy 
goes beyond his own family into the countless families that he 
influenced and that also continue to ``build their house upon a solid 
rock.&#x27;&#x27;

lasting contributions of Mrs. Aleita Huguenin. Passing away at the age 
of 77, Mrs. Huguenin leaves behind an indelible legacy as an educator, 
mentor, activist and friend.

teacher, she demonstrated a steadfast dedication to her students and 
strived to ensure they had the resources necessary. to achieve their

importance of collective bargaining, Mrs. Huguenin served as the 
president of her local teacher&#x27;s union, leading her fellow teachers in 
their first strike. Her critical work as a grassroots organizer and 
community leader, left an everlasting mark not only on Contra Costa 
County, but also California. For more than 40 years, Mrs. Huguenin 
served her country and community with an unwavering sense of justice 
and fairness. She consistently advocated for women&#x27;s rights and 
equality for all, never failing to stand up for others and uphold the 
democratic values our country was founded on.
  While exhibiting leadership as a community leader and advocate, Mrs. 
Huguenin also played a pivotal role in the California Teachers 
Association. For over 2 decades, Mrs. Huguenin impacted thousands of 
California educators. teaching them how to effectively serve future 
generations of students. As part of her critical work transforming 
California&#x27;s education system, Mrs. Huguenin spearheaded the founding 
of the California Teachers Association Summer Institute, an innovative 
training program helping teachers learn how best to address the ever-
changing needs of today&#x27;s students.
  In addition to her leadership in the education and community 
organizing fields, Mrs. Huguenin exemplified the spirit of altruism and 
innovation in all areas of her life. Mrs. Huguenin will be remembered 
not only for her decades of service to Contra Costa students and 
California teachers, but also for her genuine spirit of kindness and 
compassion. She

left an everlasting mark on her friends, students, mentees, and the 
greater California education system.
  Mrs. Huguenin&#x27;s enduring spirit will live on in her husband, son, 2 
granddaughters, stepson, brother, sister-in-law, and nephew. I would 
like to extend my deepest sympathies to Mrs. Huguenin&#x27;s loved ones. I 
know that they, along with the people of Contra Costa County, join me 
in celebrating her life and legacy.

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of H.R. 3935, the Securing 
Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act to reauthorize 
and improve important aviation programs in order to move the measure 
forward to the Senate. While there was much good in the bill, I opposed 
provisions in the underlying bill calling for continued use of leaded 
aviation fuel. I was pleased to work with the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee on securing improvements to this language in 
the manager&#x27;s amendment, which we believe will protect my constituents 
from exposure to leaded fuel used by small aircraft. The Senate should 
further improve these provisions on continued use of leaded avgas 
before the bill comes back to the House for negotiations.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 20, 2023

  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Lannie Corbin, 
the City Manager for the City of Niceville, Okaloosa County, Florida. 
On July 31, 2023, Mr. Corbin will be retiring after more than 52 years 
of service to the City of Niceville. A native of Northwest Florida, Mr. 
Corbin began his civic service as City Clerk in August 1971. He was 
then appointed City Manager/City Clerk in 1972, a position he has held 
since. Mr. Corbin is the longest-serving city manager in the history of 
the State of Florida.
  During his tenure, Mr. Corbin has been instrumental in improving the 
quality of life in Niceville and the surrounding area. One of his many 
great accomplishments includes negotiating with local landowners to 
cede a portion of their land to the city, enabling the city to more 
than double its size. This led to Nicevilles population growing from 
4,300 residents in 1972 to over 16,000 today.
  Lannie Corbin helped bring increased-quality-of-life projects to 
Niceville, such as the Turkey Creek Nature Trail, Lions Park, the 
Niceville Senior Center, the Twin Oaks Multi-use Sports Complex, the 
Children&#x27;s and Spray Parks, and multiple city parks, such as Meigs and 
Rocky Runway Commons. He also brought a new complex to the city to 
house its administrative offices, the police headquarters, community 
center, and the Children&#x27;s Park.
  One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of Niceville&#x27;s 
first public library. This led him to champion the first-ever 
cooperative effort in Okaloosa County by forming the Okaloosa County 
Library Cooperative, uniting 6 cities with the county, enabling them to 
increase the resources available to all the residents of our county.
  I, along with all of Northwest Florida, thank Niceville City Manager 
Corbin for his dedication to public service and commitment to improving 
the quality of life in the city for all its residents and visitors. His 
lifelong service exemplifies the very best of Northwest Florida.
  On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am 
privileged to recognize City Manager Lannie Corbin on the occasion of 
his retirement. I thank him for his service and offer my best wishes to 
him and to his family.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3935) to 
     amend title 49, United States Code, to reauthorize and 
     improve the Federal Aviation Administration and other civil 
     aviation programs, and for other purposes:

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Chair, I would like to include in the Record the 
following letter in opposition to Section 813 of H.R. 3935.


[[Page E702]]


                                                    July 18, 2023.
       Dear Members of Congress: We write to urge you to oppose 
     the weakening of a law that protects the millions of sports 
     fans and spectators who attend professional and collegiate 
     sporting events each year. The current statutory ban on 
     aircraft--including unmanned aircraft systems (``UAS&#x27;&#x27;) or 
     drones--flying over large stadium sporting events throughout 
     the country provides necessary safety and security 
     protections against real and potential threats.
       We are deeply concerned about section 813 of the House 
     version of the Federal Aviation Administration (``FAA&#x27;&#x27;) 
     Reauthorization Act. If adopted, the language would establish 
     a broad and complex waiver program that would permit 
     countless aircraft to fly near and over stadiums during 
     games, putting millions of fans at risk, and unnecessarily 
     so. Congress wisely eliminated a similar waiver program back 
     in 2003, after discovering troubling and persistent failures, 
     gaps, and vulnerabilities in the process for conducting 
     background checks and issuing waivers.
       The FAA first established flight restrictions over large 
     stadium sporting events immediately following the terrorist 
     attacks of September 11, 2001, in response to concerns about 
     terrorists using aircraft as weapons. Congress subsequently 
     twice codified and strengthened these restrictions, providing 
     specific criteria for aircraft operations permitted within 
     the flight restricted area. Section 813 would effectively 
     eliminate the specific criteria and replace it with an open-
     ended waiver program.
       The long-standing, congressionally mandated flight 
     restriction enhances the safety and security of large stadium 
     events, while minimizing the disruption to the National 
     Airspace System (``NAS&#x27;&#x27;). Specifically, airspace over large 
     stadiums--with a seating capacity of 30,000 people or more 
     and where NFL, MLB, and NCAA Division 1 football games or 
     major motor speedway events, such as NASCAR and INDYCAR 
     races, are taking place--is closed to all aircraft from one 
     hour before until one hour after a major sporting event. The 
     flight restrictions extend to three nautical miles from the 
     center of the stadium and from the surface to 3,000 feet 
     above the stadium. The flight restrictions do not apply to 
     authorized aircraft, such as Department of Defense, law 
     enforcement or air ambulance flight operations, or those in 
     contact with air traffic control for take offs and landings 
     at nearby airports, among others.
       Having devoted substantial resources to secure our stadiums 
     on the ground, we regard the stadium flight restriction as 
     essential to safeguarding the airspace overhead. Moreover, 
     given the proliferation of UAS in our NAS, as well as the 
     continuing need to remain vigilant to other current and 
     emerging risks, the stadium flight restriction is as vital 
     now as ever to our national security and public safety. We 
     believe section 813 complicates the airspace over stadiums, 
     compromises public safety and security, and courts potential 
     disaster.
       We, therefore, urge you to uphold current law and maintain 
     existing flight restrictions that protect the safety and 
     security of millions of fans who attend large stadium 
     sporting events every year.
           Sincerely,
     Cathy Lanier,
       Chief Security Officer, National Football League.
