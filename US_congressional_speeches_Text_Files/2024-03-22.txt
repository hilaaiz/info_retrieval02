      CELEBRATING EASTERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY&#x27;S 175TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Eastern Michigan 
University in recognition of its 175th anniversary. An R2 Doctoral 
University for High Research Activity, Easton Michigan University has 
spent the last 175 years educating the future leaders of this nation 
and its contributions to society are worthy of commendation.
  Established as Michigan State Normal School in 1849 as the first 
normal school outside of New England, the school opened its doors with 
122 enrolled students on March 29th, 1853, and quickly established a 
reputation of training excellent educators. By 1899 the school had 
developed the first four-year curriculum for a normal school in the 
United States and Michigan State Normal School became Michigan State 
Normal College. The college continued its important mission in 
educating students through World War II, the Great Depression, and 
World War II, and later became Eastern Michigan University in 1959 
after establishing its graduate school. Following the transition to 
university status, an international student exchange program was 
organized with Britain in the early 1970s to allow students to gain 
broader perspectives and experiences.

[[Page E286]]

  With the original seven colleges and schools in the arts and 
sciences, business, education, health and human services, engineering 
and technology, honors college, and the graduate school, Eastern 
Michigan University has produced numerous notable alumni over its 
storied history. The university&#x27;s more than 145,000 living alumni 
encompass several state governors including Michigan&#x27;s 31st Governor 
Fred W. Green, State Supreme Court Chief Justices including Marilyn 
Jean Kelly and Marvin B. Rosenberry, U.S. Senators Royal Copeland and 
Charles E. Potter, numerous U.S. Representatives, and former U.S. 
Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater. The University Athletics 
Department has also produced several notable professional athletes in 
the National Football League, as well as National Basketball 
Association Hall of Fame player George Gervin.
  Today, Eastern Michigan University&#x27;s main campus sits in Ypsilanti, 
Michigan, with over 800 acres available to more than 13,000 students 
across the undergraduate and postgraduate programs. Since the 1970&#x27;s, 
the university has offered courses in Jackson, Michigan, and has since 
expanded to seven satellite campuses as well as the recently added 
online course program. Additionally, several programs have been added 
to the university including the Centers for Corporate Training, the 
World College, and doctoral programs in educational leadership, 
technology, and psychology. Outside the classroom, the Eagles have 
found success in their three NCAA Division 2 national championships and 
13 NAIA Division 1 national championships in baseball, men&#x27;s cross 
country, men&#x27;s swimming and diving, and men&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track 
and field. The Eagles now compete at the NCAA Division 1 FBS level of 
collegiate sports and have twice been NCAA Division 1 national runner 
up and have made four appearances in the NCAA Division 1 men&#x27;s 
basketball tournament.
  It is inspiring to see everything that Eastern Michigan University 
has accomplished over the past 175 years and the university&#x27;s 
incredible growth is a testament to the quality education and broad 
opportunities it continues to provide to students. I am eager to see 
all that the university accomplishes in the years to come.

                          ____________________

         CELEBRATING WESTERN ENERGY ALLIANCE&#x27;S 50TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LAMBORN

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a champion of our 
nation&#x27;s abundant energy resources.
  Western Energy Alliance is celebrating 50 years of unifying 
stakeholders and policymakers in support of oil and natural gas in the 
West. Their work has helped balance the environment by providing 
citizens with the energy they need.
  Today, just as in 1974, energy policy is vital to America&#x27;s success. 
Today, as back then, we also see regulators going out of their way to 
hamstring innovative solutions from small, independent companies 
focused on harnessing our Nation&#x27;s mineral resources--companies that 
constitute the Alliance&#x27;s membership.
  Fortunately, the Alliance has been a guiding voice and valuable 
resource for members of Congress and has helped consumers combat high 
prices at the pump and lower their utility bills.
  Congratulations to Western Energy Alliance for reaching the 50-year 
milestone and I thank them for being a credible advocate of western oil 
and natural gas.

                          ____________________

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ZOE LOFGREN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of 
Hermelinda Sapien.
  She has dedicated 55 years to the Center for Employment Training, and 
the past 25 years she has displayed her unwavering leadership as 
President and Executive Director.
  The Center for Employment Training is an economic and community 
development corporation. Their job training and placement programs 
teach marketable skills to people of all educational levels and 
backgrounds, supporting them through the process of job placement. With 
12 locations, including San Jose&#x27;s, CET&#x27;s impact is monumental.
  Mrs. Sapien&#x27;s work with CET began as an Administrative Assistant, and 
her commitment served her well as she moved up to Human Resources 
Director, Chief Administrative Officer, Deputy Director, and 
ultimately, President and CEO.
  CET&#x27;s ability to work with our community and support the dignity of 
self-sufficiency is largely due to Sapien&#x27;s hard work. She dedicated 
her career to ensuring CET&#x27;s financial stability and guaranteeing that 
the needs of students at CET were being met.
  Thousands of people have received the training and support they 
needed to find meaningful employment that supports them and their 
families. Hermalinda&#x27;s work and that of all the CET staff has changed 
lives and our community for the better. Hermelinda&#x27;s leadership has 
made a profound difference.
  Hermelinda Sapien will be retiring in June of this year, and it is 
with great pride and respect that I recognize her accomplishments.
  I share with the CET&#x27;s Board of Directors in their heartfelt farewell 
to Mrs. Sapien, and we will always remember her impact on the Center 
for Employment Training&#x27;s success.

                         HONORING MATTHEW HYMEL

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Matthew 
Hymel upon his retirement from the County of Marin after more than two 
decades of extraordinary public service.
  Raised in Western Pennsylvania during the economic hardships of the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, Matthew has long been interested in how the 
government can shape public policy to support struggling communities. 
In high school, his family moved to California, where Matthew obtained 
a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics from the University of California, 
Santa Cruz. After graduating in 1988, he attended John F. Kennedy 
School of Government at Harvard University, earning his master&#x27;s degree 
in public policy.
  Matthew returned to California and took a position at the Legislative 
Analyst&#x27;s Office in Sacramento. After six months, government-wide 
layoffs prompted Matthew to relocate to the Bay Area, where he worked 
as a budget analyst for the city manager of Oakland and then for the 
controller&#x27;s office in San Francisco. In 1997, newly elected Mayor 
Willie Brown was impressed by Matthew&#x27;s budget development work and 
hired him as his budget director. Matthew worked his way up through the 
City and County of San Francisco to the role of Chief Assistant 
Controller, before joining Marin County in 2002 as Chief Assistant to 
County Administrator Mark Riesenfeld. In 2005, the Board of Supervisors 
chose Matthew as his successor and at the young age of 38, Matthew 
assumed the role of Marin County Administrator, a role he has held for 
almost two decades
  As Marin County Administrator, Matthew successfully managed a 
multimillion-dollar annual budget, supervised administrative work for 
the county&#x27;s 2,000 employees, and provided the board of supervisors 
with timely research and recommendations. He led with intelligence and 
stability during the economic challenges of the 2008 through 2010 
recession, pension obligations, and the COVID-19 pandemic. He worked 
closely with other agencies, nonprofits, healthcare providers, and the 
Marin County Office of Education to establish a cohesive approach to 
minimizing the pandemic&#x27;s impact on the community.
  Upon his retirement, Matthew leaves the county with a strong fiscal 
position and administrative plan focused on integrating cross-
departmental initiatives that address racial equity, capital 
improvements, behavioral health, affordable housing, and homelessness. 
Beyond his outstanding budget management, Matthew is known by his 
colleagues and the Marin County Board of Supervisors for his 
collaborative work style and humble demeanor. He is an exemplary public 
servant.
  Mr. Speaker, as Matthew Hymel retires after 22 years of service to 
Marin County, I respectfully ask that you join me in expressing 
heartfelt gratitude to Matthew for his innumerable achievements in 
improving the quality of life for the staff and residents of Marin 
County and in sending him best wishes on his next endeavors.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Mr. James Miller 
and to thank him for his long and exemplary career serving our 
constituents and servicemen.
  Jim&#x27;s service to our troops began four decades ago while he was 
pursuing his second Master&#x27;s Degree at Florida State University, after 
earning his first from Slippery Rock University. While pursuing his 
educational goals, he interned with the Mental Hygiene Clinic at the 
Erie County, Pennsylvania Veteran Affairs Hospital. This would prove to 
be a formative experience for Jim who, upon graduation in 1989, took a 
job at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. During his time at Fort Campbell, Jim 
served in a variety of roles including the Chief of Community Mental 
Health and the Chief of Discharge Planning. In these roles, Jim assumed 
responsibility for the well-being of countless troops and their family 
members. He flourished in Kentucky, but when Americans were called to 
serve during Operation Desert Storm, Jim followed the 101st Airborne--
the mighty Screaming Eagles--across the waves as the division&#x27;s social 
work officer. While deployed, he went above and beyond, providing 
counseling services to the troops and even establishing a mental health 
clinic similar to the one in which he had once worked in.
  Jim stayed with the 101st until 1993, afterward continuing his 
service at various installations across the nation. Though his capacity 
differed at each station, the quality of service he delivered never 
diminished. His nine-year journey concluded in 2002 when he settled in 
with the North Country&#x27;s own 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum. 
During the height of the global War on Terror, Jim provided the 
Division with the same essential, high-quality care that had defined 
his time with the 101st years prior. After serving during Operation 
Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, he returned to his roots 
at the very same Erie VA Hospital where his career had started. 
Eventually, Jim would return to the North Country, first as the chief 
of the Watertown Veterans Center and then as a clinical social worker 
with Fort Drum&#x27;s Soldier Recovery Program.
  After a long career tending to our warfighters in their hours of 
need, Jim is ready for one last transition: on March 14th, he 
celebrated a richly deserved retirement after a lifetime of service. On 
behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, it is my distinct honor to thank 
him for all he has done in service of the North Country, the 10th 
Mountain Division, and our Country.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Robin S. Reed. Robin was a giant in the Arizona business community: a 
trusted mentor, a visionary leader and a staunch advocate for minority 
entrepreneurs and community development.
  From a young age, Robin&#x27;s mother instilled in him and his four 
siblings the belief that life&#x27;s obstacles were simply opportunities in 
disguise. At age 11, Robin lent his voice to Franklin Armstrong in A 
Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, portraying the first Black character in the 
Peanuts. He embraced the opportunity with pride, recognizing the 
significance of breaking barriers and advocating for inclusivity. Robin 
discovered the rewards of hard work early--he managed golf courses in 
Northern California before he graduated high school and became a 
licensed stockbroker by the age of 19. He began his professional career 
in the financial sector--serving as a financial advisor at Charles 
Schwaab, stockbroker and detail shop owner. His experiences as a young 
man cultivated a life-long desire to help business owners thrive.
  An entrepreneur at heart, Robin started, acquired, operated, and sold 
several companies over his 40-year career. But Robin is perhaps best 
known for his tireless work as President of the Black Chamber of 
Arizona, a position he held for nearly a decade. Under his leadership, 
Robin tirelessly advocated for equitable access to the tools and 
education necessary for entrepreneurial empowerment, striving to 
eliminate barriers hindering economic growth Robin demonstrated an 
exceptional ability to navigate the complexities of the business world 
while remaining steadfast in his commitment to uplifting others. 
Because of his work, entrepreneurs across the state have been equipped 
with the confidence and resources to achieve their highest aspirations.
  Robin&#x27;s generosity extended beyond his work with the Chamber. He was 
a passionate supporter of Treasure House, an organization aimed at 
empowering young adults with disabilities, ensuring they found support 
and opportunities for independence within the community as they 
transitioned to adulthood. He used his platform on the Social 
Television Network&#x27;s Community Collaborative to highlight the actions 
of local businesses and leaders that promoted diversity, equity and 
inclusion. His recent collaboration with Impact AZ--a statewide 
initiative aimed at bridging the racial wealth gap for Black and 
minority-owned businesses--underscores his lifelong mission to foster 
intergenerational prosperity and opportunity for all Arizonans.
  We owe a debt of gratitude to Robin, who we lost at the age of 62 on 
February 28. He is survived by his wife, Shawna, and beloved children. 
Godspeed, Robin.

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a native son of 
Herkimer County, Vincent Bono, and to wish him well as he begins a new 
chapter in his storied career. Mr. Bono was born in Ilion, and he never 
strayed too far from home. In 1985, he settled in Schuyler, which has 
been his home ever since. In 2002, Mr. Bono was elected to represent 
Herkimer&#x27;s 11th district in the county legislature, where he quickly 
became a fixture. He immediately earned the nickname ``Mr. IDA&#x27;&#x27; for 
his support for the county&#x27;s Industrial Development Agency, which he 
now chairs. Vincent has been a fighter for the economic betterment of 
his beloved county since day one. Under his leadership, business parks 
in Schuyler and Frankfort were built, bringing new jobs and residents 
with them. Vincent has also been a champion for students and young 
people. One would be hard-pressed to find a more vocal advocate for 
Herkimer Community College than Mr. Bono. He takes pride in the fact 
that he began the Children&#x27;s Center initiative which will be carried on 
by his trusted colleagues and go on to have a positive impact on the 
community.
  Vincent&#x27;s service has not been limited to elected leadership. He has 
also served his community as a volunteer firefighter, risking his life 
to protect others. He has also contributed greatly to the work of 
numerous organizations tackling issues close to his heart. Whenever 
there has been a need for a reliable voice in Herkimer, Vincent has 
readily provided that voice.
  Vincent Bono has proven himself to be a true statesman. On behalf of 
New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I thank him for all he has 
contributed to life in the North Country and wish him luck as he begins 
a new chapter of his public service.

 RECOGNIZING MY PRESS SECRETARY, TAYLOR DEACON, FOR HER EXCELLENT WORK 
         ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA&#x27;S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEAN PHILLIPS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Press 
Secretary, Taylor Deacon, for her work on behalf of every constituent 
in Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District. This week, Taylor will 
depart my office for a new opportunity serving as Deputy Communications 
Director and Press Secretary in the Office of Rep. Don Davis, and I 
could not be more proud or grateful for her service.
  A Michigan native, Taylor&#x27;s Midwest work ethic shines through in 
everything she does. From earning a Girl Scout Gold Award to graduating 
Magna Cum Laude from Elon University, her grit was as evident early in 
life as it is now on Capitol Hill.
  As my Press Secretary, Taylor served as a trusted advisor and liaison 
to the media, using her sharp communications skills to articulate the 
accomplishments of our office and forge productive relationships with 
members of the press. Taylor brought a combination of passion, zeal, 
and enthusiasm to whatever task she was assigned. Her communications 
instincts, honed by work experience in the private and public sectors, 
are top notch, and I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better companion to dash to an 
interview during a busy week.
  Taylor Deacon has a rare combination of wit and patience that helps 
her maneuver whatever press landscape came her way. An invaluable 
member of my team, Taylor brought humor to a job that can often feel 
heavy and remained unflappable in tough situations. Her colleagues on 
the legislative team will always remember her skill at turning dry bill 
text into punchy press releases and consistently being game for a 
little wordplay on even the most arcane topics. Taylor has explained 
the difference between official and political work enough in the past 
year to last a lifetime and still has a bright smile for everyone she 
encounters. Her charm and grace--as well as her sarcasm--will be deeply 
missed by her colleagues.
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her expertise and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. 
However, I&#x27;m extraordinarily happy that this expertise will continue to 
serve the Nation and the people of North Carolina&#x27;s First Congressional 
District. I wish Taylor all the best in her future endeavors and thank 
her for three years of faithful service to this Nation--and many more 
to come.

             RECOGNIZING REVEREND EMMETT SCOTT ANITON, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to offer 
my heartfelt congratulations and well wishes to an exceptional mentor, 
devoted leader, Vietnam War Veteran, faithful servant of God, and 
cherished longtime friend, Reverend Dr. Emmett Scott Aniton, Jr., as he 
concludes his 45 years of service at Friendship Missionary Baptist 
Church. A special celebration marking his 45th Anniversary and 
retirement from preaching the Gospel will take place on April 7, 2024 
at the church in Columbus, Georgia.
  Born on March 8, 1940, in Oneonta, Alabama to Mr. Emmett Scott 
Aniton, Sr. and Mrs Estella Aniton Woods, Rev. Aniton graduated from 
Southside High School in Etowah County, Alabama before earning his 
Bachelor of Theology from Selma University in 1964. Following his 
service in Vietnam, he furthered his education at Alabama A&amp;M 
University, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology.
  Having answered the call to preach, Rev. Aniton began his ministry at 
First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Alabama, where he served his 
congregation faithfully. In November 1978, he accepted the call to 
pastor at Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus, Georgia, 
where he has led with passion and dedication since April 1979. Under 
his guidance, the church has flourished spiritually, numerically, and 
in its physical facilities.
  Rev. Aniton&#x27;s impact extends beyond the church walls, with his 
involvement in various community organizations and leadership roles. He 
has been recognized with awards such as the NAACP Religious Affairs 
Award and the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Lifetime Achievement Award, among 
others. His commitment to service and leadership exemplifies the quote 
by George Washington Carver when he said ``How far you go in life 
depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the 
aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the 
strong. Because someday in your life you will have been all of these. 
Rev. Aniton has used his ministry to reach people from all walks of 
life. Spurred by the example of Jesus, he has used his life&#x27;s work to 
help the ``Least of These.&#x27;&#x27;
  In reflecting on his achievements, Rev. Aniton acknowledges the 
unwavering support of his late wife, Mrs. Dorothy Rigby Aniton, his 
children, grandchildren, and extended family. Personally, I have been 
blessed to benefit from Rev. Aniton&#x27;s wisdom and friendship for over 
four decades. He never told me what I wanted to hear; he always told me 
what he felt I needed to hear. Rev. Aniton has inspired and mentored 
many with his sterling example of what a man of God should look like. 
He is truly a man after God&#x27;s own heart.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in The U.S. House of Representatives 
to join me, my wife Vivian, and the 765,000 people of Georgia&#x27;s Second 
Congressional District in expressing our deepest gratitude and best 
wishes to Reverend Dr. Emmett Scott Aniton, Jr. as he embarks on a 
well-deserved retirement after 45 years of devoted service at 
Friendship Missionary Baptist Church. May God continue to bless him and 
his loved ones as he enters this new chapter in his life.

                    RECOGNIZING SENATOR JEAN BREAUX

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANDRE CARSON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 22, 2024

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Indiana Senator 
Jean Breaux, who lived a life of selfless and profound service to the 
Indianapolis community.
  For decades, Senator Breaux served our community with her signature 
fierce advocacy and fighting spirit. Prior to holding office, Senator 
Breaux worked for the Indiana Department of Economic Development, where 
she fought for Hoosiers of all backgrounds. In 2006, she was elected to 
the Indiana Senate--following in the footsteps of her mother, Billie 
Breaux--and served as assistant Democratic leader for the Senate 
Democratic Caucus from 2012 to 2020.
  In her role, Senator Breaux fought tirelessly for vulnerable and 
disadvantaged Hoosiers. In particular, she worked to improve Black 
infant and maternal mortality, increased access to healthy food in food 
deserts, protected Hoosiers from rising utility costs, fought for 
reproductive justice, passed policies to address poverty, advocated for 
gun violence prevention to keep our communities safe, and so much more. 
In her role on the Senate Health Committee, she helped combat health 
disparities in the Black community and pushed for comprehensive access 
to care. Equity was always at the center of her service. Senator 
Breaux&#x27;s initiative to eliminate school textbook fees passed last year, 
which will help Hoosier families for generations to come.
  Senator Breaux&#x27;s impact on our community is reflected in the 
outpouring of grief and support as the entire Indiana community mourns 
this substantial loss. She was a great friend, mentor, and confidante 
to so many, including myself. On many occasions, I relied on her wisdom 
to guide me, and the lessons she taught us all will continue to endure. 
On behalf of the entire 7th Congressional District, we offer our 
condolences to those grieving this significant loss, especially her 
beloved mother, former Senator Billie Breaux.
  Today, we honor the life and legacy of Senator Jean Breaux, but we 
will continue to honor her every day moving forward by heeding her 
advice: fight for those less fortunate, no matter the obstacles in the 
way, speak up against injustice, and never stop working towards a 
brighter future.
