                        Saturday, April 20, 2024

  Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Chair, I would like to clarify the scope of the 
prohibitions in Division D of H.R. 8038.
  As I understand it, Division D of H.R. 8038 would prevent TikTok from 
obtaining distribution through app stores and online marketplaces in 
the U.S. and deprive them of obtaining Internet-hosting infrastructure 
and services provided by U.S. entities, unless and until it is divested 
from ByteDance within 270 days of enactment.
  When acting in their capacity of providing access to the Internet, 
Internet service providers (ISPs) do not engage in the activities that 
would be restricted by operation of Section 2(a)(1).
  In providing their customers access to the Internet and connectivity 
to web sites and online service, ISPs are not engaging in distribution 
activities prohibited under subparagraph (A). And in providing access 
or connectivity to web sites or online services at the request and 
direction of their customers, ISPs are not engaged in providing any 
Internet hosting services restricted under subparagraph (B).

                 APPRECIATING MRS. BEVERLY JEAN LaHAYE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 26, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I am grateful to 
honor the remarkable life of Mrs. Beverly Jean LaHaye, founder, and 
former chairman of Concerned Women for America (CWA), the Nation&#x27;s 
largest public policy women&#x27;s organization. On Sunday, April 14, 2024, 
she passed from this life, leaving behind a legacy that will endure 
through the ages, shaping the lives of countless individuals. I am 
grateful for the profound impact Mrs. LaHaye left upon us all and her 
unwavering commitment to God and public ministry and offer my sympathy 
to her family. Included in the Congressional Record is the following 
obituary for Mrs. Beverly Jean LaHaye:


[[Page E392]]


  

       Beverly Jean Davenport was born on April 30, 1929, in 
     Detroit, Michigan, the second daughter of Lowell and Nellie 
     Davenport. Her father died when she was merely two years old, 
     and her mother got remarried to a kindly neighbor man with 
     whom she had two more children. Raised in an evangelical 
     household, Beverly&#x27;s faith was a very important part of her 
     life.
       Beverly attended Bob Jones University in Greenville, South 
     Carolina, where she met ministerial student Tim LaHaye, who 
     was an Army Air Force veteran of WWII. The two fell in love, 
     and he was ready to propose marriage by Christmas break of 
     their first year. They married the following summer before 
     returning to school, Not long after, they welcomed their 
     first child, Linda, into their family. After graduating, the 
     young family moved to Minnetonka, Minnesota, where Tim 
     pastored a small church, and together, they served the people 
     of that community. Their two sons, Larry and Lee, were born 
     there.
       In 1956, they relocated to San Diego, California, to begin 
     their ministry at Scott Memorial Baptist Church. Their 
     youngest daughter, Lori, was born soon thereafter. Throughout 
     their ministry together, Beverly served as an integral part 
     of whatever God had called them to do. When the church needed 
     a secretary, Beverly stepped up to fill the role. When the 
     junior Sunday school department needed a director, the young 
     pastor&#x27;s wife met the need.
       During that time of life, Beverly had the opportunity to 
     hear from a well-known Christian speaker who taught on the 
     importance of being fitted with the Holy Spirit. She was 
     introduced to the concept that walking in the Spirit meant 
     full dependence on Christ, no matter what she was called to 
     do. She was challenged to commit an aspects of her life . . . 
     her marriage, her parenting, her fears, and her insecurities, 
     into the hands of her Savior. This teaching changed her 
     world.
       God began to direct her steps to do more public ministry, 
     including speaking at women&#x27;s ministry events and working 
     alongside her husband in his ministry to married couples 
     through Family Life Seminars. Additionally, she was 
     challenged to write, and over the course of her life Beverly 
     had written or co-written many books, including The Spirit-
     Controlled Woman, How to Develop Your Child&#x27;s Temperament, 
     and The Desires of a Woman&#x27;s Heart. Her books were one more 
     way she could communicate God&#x27;s truth to women on subjects 
     that were increasingly coming under attack in the culture 
     around her, namely womanhood, motherhood, and devotion to 
     family.
       In 1978, Beverly saw Barbara Walters&#x27; interview with Betty 
     Friedan, the founder of the National Organization for Women. 
     While watching, Beverly was convicted that she must speak on 
     behalf of millions of women who were not being represented by 
     the feminist philosophy. Friedan&#x27;s purpose, according to 
     LaHaye, was to promote homosexuality, abortion on demand, and 
     thoroughly ``undermine the core of American culture: the 
     family.&#x27;&#x27;
       God led Beverly to begin an organization that would provide 
     a platform to advance conservative values in politics and 
     policy. Concerned Women for America was launched at a rally 
     hosted by LaHaye in a local San Diego theatre. CWA began as a 
     local interest, but within two years, it had grown to become 
     a national organization aimed at protecting and promoting 
     Biblical and constitutional principles through prayer, 
     education, and advocacy.
       Believing that prayer was vital to the success of every 
     endeavor, Beverly founded CWA on the principles of prayer and 
     action. CWA became a fast-growing grassroots organization of 
     conservative women and men who were challenged and educated 
     to pray for their country and its leaders, as well as to take 
     action in their communities, states, and even at the national 
     level.
       In 1985, Beverly moved CWA headquarters from San Diego to 
     Washington, D.C. Both she and Tim believed this move was 
     vital in order for CWA to have its greatest impact on the 
     culture as the organization continued to expand. Beverly&#x27;s 
     growing influence in the conservative movement, as well as 
     Republicans holding a majority place in office, led to 
     LaHaye&#x27;s prominence during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan 
     and George H.W. Bush. She regularly testified in 
     congressional hearings, including Supreme Court nomination 
     hearings for Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork, and Clarence 
     Thomas.
       Initially, Mrs. LaHaye jumped into the debate over the 
     Equal Rights Amendment, helping lead the opposition to it as 
     well as advocating for the life of the unborn. As time went 
     on, other vital family-oriented issues arose that demanded 
     attention. She led CWA to speak out on the protection of 
     marriage, support for Israel, and more. Additionally, God led 
     Beverly to add a legal defense department to CWA&#x27;s growing 
     list of involvement as opportunities arose to be a voice on 
     behalf of women and men embattled in the court in the areas 
     of life, marriage, education, and freedom of religion.
       During the 1980s, Beverly&#x27;s heart of compassion led her to 
     reach out to Nicaraguan families who were displaced by the 
     communist regime in their country. On numerous occasions, 
     Mrs. LaHaye led teams of volunteers to the jungles of Costa 
     Rica, where they provided much-needed aid to refugees fleeing 
     from their own country. CWA established a refuge station in 
     the jungle which provided clothes, food, education, medical 
     assistance, and, most importantly, hope to these struggling 
     people.
       The influence of CWA has spread throughout the country, 
     with chapters in almost every state. As chair and founder, 
     Beverly hosted an award-winning radio talk show and appeared 
     in numerous media interviews. Beverly would not hesitate to 
     accept the opportunity to be the voice of Christian women on 
     national television, often in direct debate against some of 
     the leading feminist and pro-choice voices of the day. She 
     always conducted herself with grace and dignity and spoke 
     truth with strength and clarity.
       Throughout her years in leadership, Beverly has received 
     many awards, including Christian Woman of the Year, the 
     Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s ``Religious Freedom Award,&#x27;&#x27; as 
     well as ``Talk Show of the Year&#x27;&#x27; in 1993 or the Beverly 
     LaHaye Live radio program. In 1994, she was honored by the 
     U.S. House of Representatives for service to her country, and 
     in 2016, she was recognized by the Faith and Freedom 
     Coalition with the ``Winston Churchill Lifetime Achievement 
     Award.&#x27;&#x27; Most recently, in 2023 Beverly was named one of the 
     50 greatest pro-life leaders in the past 50 years.
       Mrs. LaHaye retired from her role as President of CWA in 
     2006. She and Tim returned to Southern California, where they 
     were closer to family. She continued to serve as Chairman of 
     the board for CWA until her retirement in 2020. In addition, 
     she continued to accept speaking engagements and served on 
     various boards for Christian colleges and organizations. Well 
     into her eighties, Beverly still loved to be a voice in the 
     cause and to educate future generations of Christian 
     activists.
       Throughout her life, Beverly&#x27;s family was very important to 
     her. She invested in them personally and prayerfully. While 
     her life was very busy, whenever possible, she tried to carve 
     out time to visit her children and grandchildren wherever 
     they were living. She organized family trips and 
     opportunities for them all to be together.
       In 2016, Beverly lost the love of her life, Tim, to a 
     stroke at the age of 90. They had been married for 69 years. 
     He was her greatest champion, her encourager, and true 
     soulmate. Ten months later, her son, Lee, also passed away. 
     It was a year of incredible loss for her. She took great 
     solace in the company of her remaining children, nine 
     grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.
       Beverly LaHaye was not born into privilege nor blessed with 
     extraordinary skills and abilities. Her life is a beautiful 
     demonstration of what God can do with a person who is fully 
     devoted to Him. She was a faithful follower of Jesus Christ 
     all the days of her life and God used her in extraordinary 
     ways to make a difference in the world around her.

                          ____________________

    HONORING THE HOWELL ROTARY CLUB FOR 100 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE 
                               COMMUNITY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 26, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I celebrate a remarkable milestone--
the 100th anniversary of the Howell Rotary Club--a century of selfless 
dedication to serving others. Since its founding in 1924, the Howell 
Rotary Club has been a pillar of the community in Howell, the 
surrounding communities in Livingston County and across the state of 
Michigan.
  Throughout its history, the Howell Rotary Club has truly embodied the 
Rotary&#x27;s motto of ``Service Above Self,&#x27;&#x27; with its members playing a 
pivotal role in shaping the moral fabric of its community, fostering 
goodwill, peace, and understanding.
  This vision is clear in the many Rotary Clubs that Howell Rotary has 
helped start throughout Livingston County, from Brighton Rotary in 1936 
to M-36 Rotary in 2020.
  Howell Rotary&#x27;s legacy of community involvement is extensive. In 
1946, the Club provided the funding for the Howell High School football 
field, making it the first lighted football field in the state of 
Michigan.
  The Club&#x27;s commitment to supporting youth through education and 
forming international friendships is exemplified by the Club&#x27;s foreign 
exchange student program. In 1951, Howell Rotary hosted the first 
foreign exchange student in Livingston County. Since then, Howell 
Rotary has sponsored these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for both 
inbound and outbound students to learn about different cultures and 
build international understanding.
  Since 1978, Howell Rotary Club has awarded scholarships to Howell 
High School graduates who demonstrate their passion for learning and 
community service to continue their educational journeys. In 2001, 
Rotarians established the Howell High School Interact Club, which helps 
students develop leadership skills and connect with their peers and 
community through acts of service.
  Howell Rotary Club has demonstrated its dedication to improving the 
lives of others through charitable endeavors like the OLHSA Walk for 
Warmth, completing Habitat for Humanity home building projects, and 
raising over $350,000 over a 13-year period for Livingston County 
United Way.
  For 100 years, the Howell Rotary Club has lifted up its community 
through its enduring commitment to service, integrity, and leadership. 
From its original 17 founding members to its hundreds since, it is my 
honor to celebrate Howell Rotary Club&#x27;s 100th anniversary and recognize 
its members&#x27; contributions.

                          ____________________

                         Friday, April 26, 2024

  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today celebrate the brave first 
responders of the Pomeroy Fire Department in Meigs County, Ohio, as 
they are being honored as the Ohio Fire Department of the Year by the 
State Fire Marshall and the Ohio Department of Public Safety.
  The 30 members of the all-volunteer Pomeroy firefighting force have 
consistently demonstrated a level of training, preparedness, and 
dedication second to none. They&#x27;ve proven their commitment to 
excellence by pursuing advanced training, completing both in-service 
and multicompany training exercises, enhancing the force&#x27;s efficiency, 
loss reduction, and ability to safeguard our community.
  I cannot say enough about how much Pomeroy&#x27;s Fire Department has 
given back to Meigs County, serving well beyond their roles as first 
responders--leading food drives, educating the community on fire safety 
and prevention, and distributing smoke detectors, among many other 
contributions.
  I am pleased to honor the fine men and women of the Pomeroy 
firefighting force for their justly deserved recognition as the Ohio 
Fire Department of the Year. Their service makes our community, 
Pomeroy, Meigs County, and Ohio, a better place--and I could not be 
more proud.
  Congratulations to them on this well-deserved award.

      IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE CLAIRMONT JEROME ``POPS&#x27;&#x27; BARNES

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 26, 2024

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a loving 
husband, outstanding father, proud grandfather, distinguished non-
commissioned officer, dedicated public official, faithful servant of 
God, and friend of longstanding, The Honorable Clairmont Jerome 
``Pops&#x27;&#x27; Barnes. Sadly, Pops transitioned from labor to reward on April 
14, 2024. A public viewing was held on Wednesday April 23, 2024, at 
Taylor Funeral Home in Phenix City, Alabama, and a memorial service to 
celebrate his remarkable life was held on Thursday, April 25, 2024, at 
the Revelation Missionary Baptist Church in Columbus, Georgia.
  The second oldest of five children, Clairmont Jerome Barnes was born 
on June 10, 1943, to the union of the late Pauline White and the late 
Eugene Barnes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was reared by his 
grandmother, Ms. Mary J. White, a woman of great importance in his 
life, who significantly shaped his worldview and instilled within him 
the values of justice, compassion, and determination.
  Pops began his life of service when he joined the Army National Guard 
and enlisted in the United States Army in 1977. Demonstrating his adept 
leadership skills, he quickly rose through the ranks, ultimately 
retiring as a Master Sergeant in 1996. Following his retirement from 
the Army, Pops decided to secure a second bachelor&#x27;s degree and begin 
the next chapter of his professional career of service. Desiring to use 
his time and skills to help those in need, Pops earned a Bachelor of 
Science degree in Nursing from Columbus State University at the ripe 
young age of 57 and served countless patients as a registered nurse.
  In 2004, Pops answered the call to run for public elective office. He 
entered the race for the District 1 seat on the Columbus, Georgia 
Consolidated Government Council. During the campaign, Pops took the 
time and effort to knock on every door in District 1, so that he could 
meet someone in every household he was running to represent and serve. 
His efforts were rewarded and he was overwhelmingly elected Councilor 
for District 1. Among his accomplishments for District 1 include 
reopening the Boxwood Park, Belvedere Park and Primus King Recreation 
center; leading the effort to hire 100 additional police officers, and 
opening a police precinct in the heart of District 1 to dramatically 
cut the city&#x27;s crime rate.
  Pops also demonstrated a steadfast passion in advocating for 
Veterans, seniors, and individuals with mental illness. He restarted 
the Tri-City Veterans Day Parade in 2010; started a senior advocacy 
group to help seniors maintain their benefits, and periodically hosted 
the ``Focus on Health&#x27;&#x27; series from the studios of CCG-TV to provide 
health and wellness education to all citizens in the Chattahoochee 
Valley area. He also launched a youth vocational training program 
entitled ``Opportunity to Get Ahead&#x27;&#x27; using his own funds; reformed the 
city&#x27;s employment policy to allow the hiring of non-violent ex-
offenders; and consistently addressed right-of-way upkeep, drainage, 
street resurfacing, and pothole issues throughout District 1 on behalf 
of those he served.
  In addition to his work as a City Councilor, Pops has been recognized 
for his community involvement and service with numerous social and 
civic organizations to include: American Legion; Disabled American 
Veterans Board; American Military Society Board; Red Cross Minority 
Recruitment Board; Concerned Citizens of South Columbus Board; and the 
Columbus Hospice Board. Because of his dedicated commitment to these 
and other organizations he was the recipient of several awards to 
include the Family Caregiver Award (2016); the Living Legends Award 
(2018); the United States Postal Service Purple Heart Award (2019); the 
Distinguished Older Georgian Award (2020); New Horizons Behavioral 
Health Impact Award (2021); the Columbus State University (CSU) Legacy 
Award (2023); the Columbus State University Alumni Award (2023); and 
the River Valley Regional Commission Council Chairman Appreciation 
Award (2023).
  It has been said that ``The true person of success is not the person 
that climbs the ladder of this life with both hands but who climbs with 
one hand and reaches back with the other.&#x27;&#x27; Pops always reached back to 
help others throughout his life and never shied away from an 
opportunity to improve the quality of life for those in his community. 
On a personal note, Pops Barnes was always available and forthcoming 
regarding issues being considered by Congress. He always gave me sound, 
wise and honest advice. For that I will be forever grateful.
  Pops Barnes accomplished much in his life but none of it would have 
been possible without the grace of God, the love and support of his 
wife, Jannie Mae Barnes; his devoted children, Cheryl, Clairmont, Simi, 
Mary, Robbi, Carla, Phydellis, and Bruce; thirteen grandchildren, and 
nineteen great-grandchildren. But through their love, inspiration and 
support, Pops leaves a legacy that has made Columbus, our nation and 
the world better because he passed this way.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 765,000 people of 
Georgia&#x27;s Second Congressional District in celebrating the 
extraordinary life of The Honorable Clairmont Jerome ``Pops&#x27;&#x27; Barnes 
and in extending our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and 
all who mourn his loss. May we all be consoled and comforted by an 
abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Danica Barela 
for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
  Danica has overcome many challenges along her journey to success, 
demonstrating perseverance at every step. Students who strive to make 
the most of their education, like Danica, develop crucial skills and a 
work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award 
is a testament to Danica&#x27;s hard work, determination, and perseverance 
at Drake Middle School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright 
and promising future.
  It is my honor to congratulate Danica Barela on achieving the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

                         Friday, April 26, 2024

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions of one of my constituents, Denise Aiello, a 
volunteer Peer Specialist with LifeStream Behavioral Center. She works 
with the citizens of Citrus County who have substance misuse disorders. 
Denise focuses her efforts with pregnant mothers, meeting them at their 
prenatal appointments, ensuring follow-up with maternity care, and 
providing resources to address treatment needs, and other material 
resources. Denise also works closely with Citrus EMTs responding to 
overdose calls as part of the CORe program, meeting consumers at the 
emergency room to offer connections to substance misuse treatments 
including MAT, counseling, or admission to residential treatment. 
Denise will meet with the consumer at their home or outpatient 
appointment to provide support, guidance, and assistance with 
paperwork. She will respond at night and on weekends if a call comes 
in. She is dedicated to helping others rehabilitate and recover. She 
will make repeated attempts to engage with a consumer, understanding 
they might need time to recognize and accept that they need help. 
Denise is an empathic and dedicated peer who is an asset to the 
LifeStream family and to the residents of Citrus County.
  It is clear that Ms. Aiello has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community and on the lives of countless people she has worked with 
in the fight against the horrific crime of human trafficking. I am 
grateful for her service.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions of one of my constituents, Jacqueline Vandyke, a 
volunteer with the Gulf Coast Manatees Homeschool Group. Jacqueline has 
given so much of herself to make sure children in the program succeed. 
As founder of the first non-profit homeschool group in Citrus County, 
she finds fun and interactive ways for the children to learn. The 
children get to go on trips, learn hands-on life skills, all while 
making friends. She also is committed to helping install the value of 
community service in children, spearheading: food drives, feeding 
programs for the homeless, beautification of church grounds, creating 
cards for soldiers, and wrapping gifts for cancer patients. Jacqueline 
makes sure all kids get a moving up and graduation ceremony.
  Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of 
ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to 
others. Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part 
of the fabric that unites us.
  It is clear that Ms. Vandyke has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community, and I am grateful for her service.

    RECOGNIZING JE DUNN CONSTRUCTION GROUP&#x27;S CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 26, 2024

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with immense pride to 
recognize and celebrate the centennial anniversary of JE Dunn 
Construction Group. This milestone is a testament to the hard work, 
dedication, and contributions that JE Dunn has made in the construction 
industry.
  Founded in 1924 by John Ernest ``Ernie&#x27;&#x27; Dunn, this company that 
began in Kansas City, has now stretched across various generations of 
the Dunn family, and has only increased their reach beyond Missouri&#x27;s 
Fifth Congressional District as the years have passed by. With over 26 
offices nationwide and being placed as the 8th overall largest 
contractor in the United States, this company has served its community 
through the principle of enriching lives.
  Today, JE Dunn employs more than 1,200 people in Kansas City and 
4,000 across the country. In 1964 when Ernie Dunn passed, the company 
was worth $1.4 million and now the company is nearing a revenue of $6 
billion. The contributions in the local Kansas City area are important 
to job creation and sustaining economic growth as the city continues to 
grow and receive national and international attention.
  Through JE Dunn&#x27;s commitment to the local region, Kansas City began 
to see an increase in innovation and development in the 1960s with the 
development of Worlds of Fun, the Hy-Vee Arena then known as the Kemper 
Arena, among others. As their mission to serve others in the pursuit of 
building perfection continues, JE Dunn has been vital in recent 
developments such as the Kansas City Zoo and building the world&#x27;s first 
ever stadium for a women&#x27;s pro sports team. The impact of these 
investments will have a positive ripple effect on our city and 
community for generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing this 
momentous celebration and thanking JE Dunn for their contributions to 
the Greater Kansas City area and beyond. It is a distinct privilege to 
represent the JE Dunn Construction Group in the United States House of 
Representatives. I speak with the voice of Missouri&#x27;s entire Fifth 
Congressional District as we congratulate them and wish them many more 
years of success.

                         Friday, April 26, 2024

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
unique contributions that have been made in our community by one of my 
constituents, Keith Vick, an active volunteer with Habitat for Humanity 
of Citrus County since 2022. In his first full year as a core 
construction volunteer, Mr. Vick has already made an immense impact. He 
believes in providing a hand-up, not a hand out to partner families. As 
a U.S. Air Force Veteran and a retired first responder, Mr. Vick has 
contributed 434 hours of volunteer time. He leads by example!
  Mr. Vick has become a favorite of the family partners because of his 
compassion and willingness to share the skills he has acquired 
throughout life. As each home is completed, Mr. Vick takes it upon 
himself to go through the final checklist, or ``punch list&#x27;&#x27;, to make 
sure homes are finished to the high standards set by Habitat. Each day 
Keith is out there, he&#x27;s always in a great mood and ready to work and 
help others. He&#x27;s around enough to know what needs to be done each day. 
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary 
Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others. 
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part of the 
fabric that unites us.
  It is clear that Mr. Vick has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community, and I am grateful for his service.

Artillery Regiment, where he eventually became First Sergeant.
  For the last two and a half years, Marc led the 213th Regional

understanding units within his command, which he did to better prepare 
and lead the formations.

Bosnia, Kosovo, England, and Iraq, as well as multiple state and drug 
interdiction missions.
  Upon his retirement, Marc was presented with the Legion of Merit 
award for his devoted service and career.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Sgt. Maj. Weiss for his commitment to 
our Nation and his selfless service. We are indebted to the 35 years of 
sacrifice he has given. I wish him all the best in his well-earned
