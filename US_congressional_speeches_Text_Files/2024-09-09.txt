       CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF THELMA HOLTZCLAW MATHEWS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mrs. Thelma 
Holtzclaw Mathews on the occasion of her 100th birthday.
  Mrs. Mathews was born on September 26, 1924, and grew up with her 
parents and seven siblings in Titus, Alabama. She moved to Buffalo 
fifty-four years ago where she has lived since.
  After graduating high school, Mrs. Mathews&#x27;s top priority was her 
family. Together with the love of her life, Luther, they raised six 
incredible children, three daughters and three sons. Mrs. Mathews&#x27; 
family continues to grow, with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
She is most proud to be a wife, mother, grandmother, and great-
grandmother.
  When Mrs. Mathews is not with her family, she is with her friends and 
neighbors. They know they can always rely on her for a warm smile and a 
laugh. Deeply devoted to her faith, Mrs. Mathews is an active member of 
the Greater Refuge Temple of Christ on Jefferson Avenue.
  Further, Mrs. Mathews deeply values civic engagement, having voted in 
every presidential election she has been able to. She was very excited 
to vote for the first Black President, President Barack Obama, and is 
looking forward to casting her ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris, 
the first Black woman nominated by a major party for President.
  Today, Mrs. Thelma Holtzclaw Mathews continues to inspire all who 
know her, sharing her compassion and dedication to her family, friends, 
country, and faith. Please join me in celebrating Mrs. Thelma Holtzclaw 
Mathews on her 100th birthday.

    COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPENING OF BOOKER T. 
                         WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL

                                 ______

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as students return to school 
for the upcoming school year, I rise today to recognize the 100th 
Anniversary of the opening of Booker T. Washington High School in 
Georgia&#x27;s Fighting Fifth Congressional District.
  In September 1924, the opening of Booker T. Washington High School 
marked the first opportunity for Black students in the State of Georgia 
to attend a public high school. This momentous achievement was the 
culmination of tireless organizing and a direct result of Atlanta&#x27;s 
Black Community&#x27;s political power and determination.
  In fact, not until the NAACP and Black community leaders conducted a 
successful voter registration drive and new Black voters defeated a 
school bond referendum in 1919 did promises of a new Black high school 
bear fruit, with money from a 1921 school bond used to construct what 
would become Booker T. Washington High School.
  Black students came from across the state to study at Booker T. 
Washington High School, as it remained Georgia&#x27;s only public high 
school for Black students until 1947. The school&#x27;s origins in 
organizing and collective power are evident in the remarkable alumni it 
has produced, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., groundbreaking 
surgeon and educator Dr. Asa Yancy, State Representative ``Able&#x27;&#x27; Mable 
Thomas, trailblazing lawyer and judge Romae T. Powell, former United 
States Secretary for Health and Human Services Dr. Louis Sullivan, and 
educator Dr. Pearlie Craft Dove.
  From its inception, Booker T. Washington High School has been part of 
the fabric ot Atlanta and the State of Georgia and an integral part of 
its community. Students, neighbors, and alums continue to tout the 
skill and energy of the marching band and take every opportunity to 
enjoy school spirit and their music.
  Booker T. Washington High School deserves a place in history, not 
just in the history of Atlanta or Georgia, but of our country. I hope 
you will join me in both recognizing this historic day and in 
cosponsoring a resolution to be introduced later this month that will 
commemorate the 100th anniversary of Booker T. Washington High School.

                          ____________________

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate the exceptional work demonstrated by American Legion Post No. 
682, and to celebrate the unveiling of their Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Brick 
Wall.
  For years, American Legion Post No. 682 has selflessly served the 
veterans of our community. As a combat veteran, I believe taking care 
of America&#x27;s heroes when they return home must be a top priority, and 
American Legion Post No. 682 has courageously stepped up to the task.
  One such way they are honoring America&#x27;s heroes is with the unveiling 
of their Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Brick Wall, a memorial constructed to 
showcase the community&#x27;s love and recognition of those who have given 
all for their country.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this 
impressive achievement and congratulate American Legion Post No. 682 on 
the unveiling of their Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Brick Wall.

Muhammad.

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the incredible service of 
my dear friend and 16-term Congresswoman from California, 
Representative Anna Eshoo. Anna has served the people of San Mateo, 
Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties with great distinction for over 
three decades. She&#x27;s hardworking, meticulous, and demanding of herself. 
In sum, Anna Eshoo is the kind of person every Member of Congress 
should be like. She has built a legacy of fighting for her 
constituents, and her leadership in Congress will be greatly missed 
upon her retirement.
  First elected to Congress in 1992--dubbed ``the Year of the Woman&#x27;&#x27;--
Anna was the first Democrat and first woman in the history of the then-
14th Congressional District to win the Silicon Valley seat. In 
Congress, Anna has been a health care pioneer, a champion for 
innovation, a human rights and consumer advocate, a staunch proponent 
of clean energy, and a defender of women&#x27;s reproductive rights. A 
prolific legislator, over 60 of Anna&#x27;s bills have been signed into law 
by five presidents.
  Anna has served on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee since 
1995. In 2019, she became the first woman to serve as Chair of the 
Health Subcommittee. Anna helped draft portions of the groundbreaking 
Affordable Care Act, oversaw the largest overhaul of Medicare since its 
inception, and wrote landmark bipartisan legislation to promote the 
development of new lifesaving cures. Anna also broke the glass ceiling 
as the first female Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on 
Communications and Technology, where she has championed a free and open 
internet, removed barriers to entry in the telecommunications market, 
and helped deploy broadband to underserved communities.
  I know Anna is grateful to her dedicated staff in both California and 
Washington, D.C. for the countless achievements they have secured for 
constituents over the years, and for the support of her children and 
granddaughter. I thank them for their years of service and sacrifice. I 
congratulate my good friend and colleague on a well-deserved retirement 
and wish her the very best in her next chapter in life.

 HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND LEGACY OF SENIOR CHIEF PETTY OFFICER ERIC 
                                DONAHUE

                                 ______

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Senior Chief Petty 
Officer Eric Donahue for his tremendous contributions and 20-year 
legacy in the United States Navy, including his service in the Joint 
Special Operations Command. Senior Chief Donahue has dedicated his life 
to our country for the past two decades, all while building a family 
with his wife, Katie, and raising their three children: Meredith, Ivy, 
and Tyler.
  Eric Donahue was born and raised in Andover, Massachusetts, and is a 
proud graduate of Austin Preparatory School in Reading, Massachusetts. 
A dedicated student, he furthered his education at the University of 
New Hampshire, obtaining a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Business 
Administration, Management, and Operations. It was at the University of 
New Hampshire that Eric met Katie, who has been a pillar of strength 
for him throughout his Navy career.
  Moved by the September 11th terrorist attacks, Eric embarked on a 
mission to become a Navy SEAL to protect the United States, its 
freedoms, and its ideals. After graduating from the University of New 
Hampshire in 2004, he had the opportunity to join the Navy as an 
officer. Instead of waiting to become an officer, he immediately 
enlisted to begin training without officer status.
  In March 2005, Eric commenced Underwater Demolition/SEAL training and 
successfully completed the program by August 2006, displaying 
exceptional dedication. He was subsequently assigned to SEAL Team 8 in 
Virginia Beach, Virginia. Throughout eight overseas deployments, 
including to Afghanistan and Iraq, his dedication, leadership, and 
outstanding service led to his appointment to the prestigious SEAL Team 
Six, the Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Within SEAL Team Six, 
Senior Chief Donahue has continued to lead in various capacities, 
overseeing numerous training events worldwide and being entrusted with 
dignitary protection.
  Senior Chief Donahue has received numerous accolades and awards 
throughout his career in recognition of his service. These include five 
Sea Service Deployment ribbons, three Presidential Unit Citations, two 
Navy and

[[Page E872]]

Marine Corps Commendation Medals, three Navy and Marine Corps 
Achievement Medals, one Navy Unit Commendation Medal, a NATO Medal, a 
Joint Service Achievement Medal, three Joint Service Commendation 
Medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, an Iraq Campaign Medal, six 
Good Conduct Medals, an Expeditionary Medal, three Combat Action 
Ribbons, a Bronze Star with Valor, an Army Commendation Medal, and an 
Afghan Campaign Medal.
  Senior Chief Eric Donahue has demonstrated remarkable bravery, 
selflessness, and dedication as a Navy SEAL. He exemplifies the values 
of courage, resilience, and sacrifice that we hold dear as Americans. 
His leadership will leave a lasting impact on the United States Navy 
and our Nation. I would like to formally recognize and extend my 
deepest gratitude to Senior Chief Donahue and his family for their 
twenty years of service to our country.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my former Chief 
of Staff, Tim Bertocci, for his work on behalf of every constituent in 
Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District. In May, Tim departed my 
office for a new opportunity serving as the Director of External 
Affairs in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special 
Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, and I could not be more proud or 
grateful for his service.
  Tim has an impressive and extensive background in public service and 
leadership. He began his career after graduating from the U.S. Military 
Academy at West Point and was commissioned as an Armor officer. During 
his nine years of military service, Tim served in various leadership 
positions, to include serving in combat during Operation Iraqi Freedom 
III. Tim also earned a Master of Arts degree from the Security Studies 
Program at Georgetown University in 2008. He has worked in various 
roles including the Senior Operations Advisor for the Joint IED Defeat 
Organization and as a Foreign Service Officer in Havana, Cuba.
  Tim&#x27;s experience and relationships on the Hill from his time working 
in former Congressman Tim Walz&#x27; Office were invaluable as we stood up 
an office and built a team of bright, motivated, and radically 
hospitable public servants. He helped lead us all through a series of 
unexpected and unprecedented events. On top of his duties as Chief, he 
also served as an instructor at the United States Naval Academy where 
he taught a class on irregular warfare in the Political Science 
Department.
  Staff members of our office past and present all proclaim that Tim is 
the true embodiment of a servant leader. A trusted advisor and 
confidant, Tim always put the needs of the team before himself. He even 
used a tiny, converted bathroom as an office instead of the large 
office normally dedicated to the Chief, to allow staff to have a 
dedicated space they could hold meetings in. For Tim, success is never 
about individual accomplishments or prestige, but instead about those 
around him reaching their highest potential individually and 
collectively.
  Tim set a culture of camaraderie and support across the team, always 
prepared with a shout out or well timed, supportive gif in the Teams 
chat. He had an unparalleled ability to create compromise and identify 
a novel path forward after taking into careful consideration all the 
options. Though he rarely mentioned it, his record of military service 
brought a much-needed perspective and calm confidence to our team. Even 
in the most difficult congressional moments--it was clear Tim had lived 
through much worse. Tim&#x27;s humility and expertise were unmatched during 
those difficult times.
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have Tim&#x27;s dedication, leadership and unwavering commitment, and he 
will be dearly missed. However, I&#x27;m extraordinarily happy that he will 
continue to serve the nation at the U.S. Department of Defense. I wish 
Tim all the best in his future endeavors and thank him dearly for his 
23 years of public service to this Nation--and many more to come.

   RECOGNIZING THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE 103D ATTACK SQUADRON

                                 ______

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to rise in 
recognition of the distinct achievements and serviceable contributions 
of 103d Attack Squadron on the occasion of their 100th anniversary. For 
a century, the men and women of the 103d Attack Squadron have served 
our nation with distinction, dedication, resilience, and valor. As the 
oldest flying squadron in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and one of 
29 original National Guard observations squadrons, their contributions 
to our national defense are immeasurable and their legacy is one of 
innovation, excellence and steadfast bravery.
  The 103d Attack Squadron traces its lineage back to its formation in 
June 1924. Federally recognized as the 103d Observation Squadron and 
commanded by Major Charles Biddle, the 103d has been an integral part 
of American military history, participating in nearly every global 
conflict since World War II. The 103d flew a variety of training and 
observation aircraft until 1941 when the unit was ordered to active 
service, performing anti-submarine patrols along the New England coast. 
From 1943 through the end of World War II, the 103d flew photo 
reconnaissance missions in the F-5C in the China-Burma-India Theater.
  From the end of World War II, the 103d was redesignated over ten 
times and has operated continually since its inception. This unit has 
gallantly conducted aerial missions and continually maintained 
operational mission readiness in the following capacities: as a 
bombardment squadron, a reconnaissance squadron, a military airlift 
squadron, a tactical air support squadron, a fighter squadron and, 
finally in its current role, as an attack squadron. The men and women 
of the 103d Attack Squadron have skillfully operated over twenty 
distinctly different aircraft, providing over a century of global 
strike and air superiority capabilities for joint force operations in 
austere areas, worldwide. Their continual adaptation to the war-
fighting environment is a true testament to the resiliency, 
adaptability, and reliability of the men and women of this storied 
unit.
  Their unwavering dedication to duty and willingness to innovate to 
meet the needs of the ever-changing battlefIeld landscape is no better 
demonstrated than in their most recent transition from manned aircraft 
to unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The professionals of the 103d Attack 
Squadron employ the General Atomics MQ-9 in combat air patrols that 
directly support combatant commanders across the globe providing 
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance gathering capabilities, 
combat search and rescue, and precision weapons employment in close air 
support operations. The 103d Attack Squadron is critical to the 
development and implementation of tactics, techniques and procedures

  Throughout its long history, the 103d Attack Squadron has embodied 
the core values of the United States Air Force: Integrity First, 
Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do. They have safeguarded 
the nation&#x27;s skies, provided critical support in times of war, and 
stood ready to respond when called upon. Their aircrew and superior 
operational support personnel have been, and continue to be, some of 
the most skilled and dedicated Airmen in the world.
  As we celebrate this historic milestone, it is my distinct honor to 
celebrate those who have faithfully served in the 103d Attack Squadron 
over the past century. Their sacrifices and those of their families 
have ensured our freedom and security. It is with deep gratitude that 
we acknowledge their service and pay tribute to their bravery.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 
100th anniversary of the 103d Attack Squadron and in extending a 
heartfelt thank you to the men and women who have served, and continue 
to serve, in this distinguished unit. May the next 100 years of Airmen 
serve with the same valor, honor, dignity, and dedication to duty as 
the exemplary men and women of the 103d Attack Squadron have so 
expertly demonstrated over the last century of service.

                     RECOGNIZING THE USS NEW JERSEY

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. ANDY KIM

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 9, 2024

  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
Commissioning of the Naval Vessel, the USS New Jersey on September 14, 
2024.
  The third naval vessel named after the great State of New Jersey, 
this Virginia class submarine is a nuclear-powered cruise missile fast-
attack vessel that will prove invaluable to the efficacy of our great 
Navy. After rigorous tests and trials at sea, this ship has proved its 
capability to perform her designed mission and join America&#x27;s strong 
Naval fleet.
  Upon being commissioned. the USS New Jersey will welcome our brave 
sailors from the Commanding Officer to the crew who are entrusted with 
maintaining and operating the submarine during peacetime and time of 
war. Not just a phrase but a guiding light through high seas and 
troubled times, the submarine&#x27;s motto--Firepower for Freedom--inspires 
all of its crew members to preserve our Nation&#x27;s values in fighting for 
valor and freedom across the globe.
  With many Americans coming together in Monmouth County to celebrate 
the commissioning of the USS New Jersey, we also celebrate the long 
legacy of tenacity and bravery that the Navy has proved time and time 
again. The brave sailors on all three USS New Jersey vessels, and 
vessels across the globe, exemplify the honor, courage, and commitment 
stated in the Navy&#x27;s core values.
  As the crew begins their service aboard this exceptional naval 
vessel, I am grateful for the devotion each and every one of them has 
to serving their country. I look forward to continuing to support the 
USS New Jersey and its&#x27; servicemembers in achieving their many missions 
to come.

                          ____________________
