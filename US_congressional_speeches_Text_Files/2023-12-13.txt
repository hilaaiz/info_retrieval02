  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alonzo Medina 
for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.

will guide them for the rest of their lives. This award is a testament 
to Alonzo&#x27;s hard work, determination, and perseverance at Arvada K-8 
School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising 
future.
  It is my honor to congratulate Alonzo Medina on achieving the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.

          COMMEMORATING THE 6TH ANNIVERSARY OF BORICUACTIVATED

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 13, 2023

  Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, when most people imagine 
American democracy, they picture the House, Senate, or the President 
and the work that we do as lawmakers to enact critical legislation to 
carry out the Nation&#x27;s business. Or maybe they imagine themselves and 
their friends and neighbors in the voting booth, casting ballots that 
will determine the make-up of government at the state, local, and 
federal levels.
  To me, however, American democracy also takes another form: the 
ongoing dialogue between citizens and public servants like us they 
elect to represent them. In these conversations we learn our 
constituents&#x27; hopes and dreams for the future, learn to make their 
priorities our priorities, and live up to our founders&#x27; ideal that the 
people should be allowed--and encouraged--to petition their government.
  That is true civic engagement; and that idea is at the heart of 
BoricuActivatEd, a stellar, Philadelphia-based volunteer-run 
organization that is now celebrating its 6th year.
  The organization was created during the tragedies of Hurricanes Maria 
and Irma which struck Puerto Rico in 2017, killing an estimated 3,000 
people and leading to the longest power blackout in U.S. history. The 
group was created to mobilize people across the country to advocate for 
needed disaster aid and was immediately successful in marshaling the 
combined voice of the Puerto Rican Diaspora. They made their power felt 
and demonstrated that civic engagement works.
  Through their civic engagement workshops, BoricuActivatEd has 
provided over 4,000 individuals with the tools they need to make their 
voices heard. Thanks to BoricuActivatEd&#x27;s tireless efforts, countless 
more high school students, former juvenile offenders, and community 
members from across the country will have the opportunity and ability 
to advocate for the issues important to them. And their elected 
officials are listening. Indeed, I can personally attest, having 
participated in their workshops, how effective and valuable these 
sessions can be.
  As it enters its seventh year, BoricuActivatEd continues to grow its 
programs, developing new curricula for high school students--including 
the Esperanza Academy in my district--and expanding their programs into 
new cities, to empower the next generation of Americans.
  By training people of all ages and securing the participation of 
elected officials at all levels of government, BoricuActivatEd embodies 
civic engagement and community empowerment at its finest.
  I am proud to congratulate BoricuActivatEd on their 6th anniversary 
and wish them every success as they embark on new accomplishments in 
the years ahead.

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 13, 2023

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Mrs. Betsy Jane Flenner 
for 16 years of dedicated service to our country.
  As a Lead Congressional Correspondent and Security Manager in the 
U.S. Navy Office of Legislative Affairs, Betsy has helped answer 
thousands of questions from the American people. In the office, she is 
known for her willingness to take on any question and find an answer, 
no matter how easy or how complex.
  Betsy is admired and respected by her colleagues--her work ethic and 
heart for service have made her an asset to her team and to the many 
Virginians who have benefitted from her help. She has built long-
lasting relationships with staff in the halls of Congress, an example 
of her exceptional service and her willingness to go above and beyond 
her job description.
  Throughout the last eight Congresses, Betsy has been a standout team 
member. Her commitment to providing excellent service has earned her 
the Superior Civilian Service Award--one of the highest honorary awards 
under the Department of the Navy Civilian Awards program. Her 
enthusiasm for providing our Veterans and servicemembers with the 
answers they need will be missed.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating and 
thanking Mrs. Betsy Jane Flenner and in wishing her the best in her 
retirement.

HONORING MICHELLE Y. CROMWELL ON HER RETIREMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF 
                                DEFENSE

                                 ______

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 13, 2023

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 
distinguished public service and career of a hardworking, talented, and 
principled Marylander from my district: Mrs. Michelle Y. Cromwell. I 
thank her for her 43 years of dedicated service with the Department of 
Defense, more specifically, the Department of the Army from December 
29, 1980, to December 31, 2023. Throughout her career, Mrs. Cromwell 
has served the Department of the Army faithfully and personified the 
Army&#x27;s values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, 
integrity, and personal courage. As the Chief of the Congressional 
Inquiry Division within the Office of the Chief, Legislative Liaison 
(OCLL), Mrs. Cromwell worked with many Congressional offices on a wide 
variety of Army issues and programs with the

[[Page E1223]]

highest degree of professionalism and outstanding resourcefulness. We 
all ought to recognize and celebrate her many accomplishments.
  Mrs. Cromwell began her career working for OCLL&#x27;s Congressional 
Inquiry Division on December 29, 1980, as a Clerk Typist. Mrs. Cromwell 
has served in many positions within the Congressional Inquiry Division, 
including a two-year stint in the Senate Liaison Division on Capitol 
Hill. She has worked her entire federal career in the OCLL, supporting 
and responding to countless inquiries from Members of Congress and 
their staffers, the Army Senior Leader, and constituents. Mrs. Cromwell 
has also helped with the release of Army contract and casualty 
announcements to Congress, ensuring the needs of contractors, 
civilians, soldiers, and their families were met. Additionally, she was 
tasked with several special missions directly supporting the Secretary 
of the Army. From these successes she was ultimately promoted to Chief 
of the Congressional Inquiry Division in 2018. During her tenure, Mrs. 
Cromwell has guided the division and organization through numerous 
major events.
  Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Cromwell has loyally served the Department of the 
Army throughout the Cold War, Operations Just Cause, Desert Shield, 
Desert Storm, Noble Eagle, the September 11, 2001 tragedy, Operations 
Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, Inherent Resolve and Freedom&#x27;s 
Sentinel. For her indelible contributions to our country, Mrs. Cromwell 
received the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal, Superior Civilian 
Service Award, Commander&#x27;s Award for Civilian Service, and the Civilian 
Service Achievement Medal. She did not serve because she wanted awards 
and accolades, however. She served because she believed in the vital 
importance of her work.
  Mrs. Cromwell has been an invaluable asset to our government, our men 
and women in uniform, and the American people. Although many will be 
sad to see her departure, she deserves a long and happy retirement. As 
she starts this next chapter, I wish her, her husband Stewart, her two 
sons, and the rest of their family and friends well. I am certain that 
all my fellow Members of the House will join me in thanking Mrs. 
Michelle Cromwell for her commitment and contributions to our Nation.

                                 ______

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 13, 2023

  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday 
of First Lieutenant Abraham ``Abe&#x27;&#x27; Schnitzer of Houston, Texas, and 
his service as a navigator in the United States Army Air Corps during 
the Second World War.
  Mr. Schnitzer was born in Port Arthur, Texas, on August 18, 1923. 
After graduating from Port Arthur High School, he went to work for 
Bethlehem (previously called Pennsylvania) Shipyard in Beaumont, Texas. 
In 1942, while working as a foreman overseeing shipbuilding operations, 
Mr. Schnitzer felt called to quit his ``safe job&#x27;&#x27; and join the 
military to defend his country. He did so and was commissioned in the 
United States Army Air Corps.
  He specialized as a navigator on the B-17 Flying Fortress. He was 
first assigned to the 445th Bombardment Group of the 2nd Air Division 
of the Eighth Air Force to continue training on B-17 bombers. He was 
soon designated the lead navigator of the entire group and guided many 
bombing missions over Nazi-occupied France and Belgium.
  As the war continued, he was eventually placed in the B-24 Liberator, 
where he and his crew carried out 20 dangerous missions over Germany. 
In fact, his bombardment group led the first bombing mission on Berlin. 
American actor and icon Jimmy Stewart was one of the officers in that 
group, and he would join Mr. Schnitzer and the other airmen in their 
downtime.
  During his time in the European Theater, Mr. Schnitzer flew 24 combat 
missions and accumulated 165 combat flight hours. According to his 
service records, he ``navigated B-24 aircraft over land and sea by dead 
reckoning, pilotage, celestial, and radio navigation.&#x27;&#x27; For his 
military duty, Mr. Schnitzer was awarded the Distinguished Flying 
Cross, Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, European-African-Middle 
Eastern Campaign Medal with four Bronze Service Stars, and a 
commendation from the French government.
  Interestingly, two of Mr. Schnitzer&#x27;s missions over Kassel, Germany, 
carry personal significance, as it was the very town that his future 
wife and her Jewish family fled during the early years of what would be 
known as the Holocaust in 1937. He met Edith Isenberg as an Air Force 
Cadet in 1942 and sent her a daily postcard from Europe until he 
returned home in 1945. They were married for 68 years and had three 
children: Robert, Dinah, and Alan.
  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to honor Abraham ``Abe&#x27;&#x27; Schnitzer, a 
centenarian and distinguished patriot of our great Nation. May God 
continue to bless Mr. Schnitzer--a proud member of the Greatest 
Generation.

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of 
a notable constituent from my district and friend, the Honorable John 
J. Rufe, who passed away on November 18.
  Judge Rufe had served the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County as a 
judge since 1989, serving in a full-time capacity until 2009,

[[Page E1224]]

whereupon he entered into a Senior Judgeship within the County of 
Bucks. Judge Rufe was dedicated to serving the residents of Bucks 
County, and during his years of service he always looked forward to a 
day&#x27;s work at the bench. During his tenure as a Senior Judge presiding 
over drug court, Judge Rufe fully supported and advocated for efforts 
to meaningfully help the rehabilitation of those suffering from 
addiction throughout Bucks County.
  Judge Rufe left the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas in December 
2018, leaving behind a profound legacy that touched so many lives. 
Judge Rufe will be remembered for his commitment to serving the 
residents of Bucks County and for his dedication to learning from the 
past and to confronting the challenges that our community will face in 
the future.
  Judge Rufe will always be remembered as a loving Husband, Father, and 
Grandfather and we are all incredibly grateful for the positive impact 
he has had on our community. Let us continue his legacy of public 
service each and every day.
