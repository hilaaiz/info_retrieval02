               CELEBRATING LITERACY KC&#x27;S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, June 20, 2025

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Literacy KC, 
Kansas City&#x27;s only adult-focused literacy organization, for their 
exceptional work challenging illiteracy in Missouri&#x27;s Fifth 
Congressional District. For forty years, Literacy KC has ceaselessly 
pursued its mission of promoting literacy for all and has empowered 
thousands of low-literate individuals through the organization&#x27;s direct 
services, advocacy work, and community collaboration initiatives.
  Literacy KC was born out of a passion for community engagement and 
mutual support. In 1985, a group of volunteers led by Catherine Mathews 
perceived a need for adult literacy services and took the initiative to 
form a small, literacy tutoring group. Initially, with only a handful 
of students, the organization worked out of the basement at Country 
Club Congregational Church and relied solely on volunteer labor. 
Mathews affiliated the organization with the National Laubach Literacy 
Council, which gave the fledgling group access to curriculum and 
materials. Mathews and her team of unpaid instructors called themselves 
the Kansas City Laubach Literacy Council before changing their name to 
Literacy KC.
  What began as an ambitious dream eventually became a reality, with 
the organization hiring an executive director and full-time staff as 
classroom sizes swelled and funding was secured. Literacy KC has 
advocated tirelessly for adult education programs since its inception, 
working to acknowledge and address the barriers low-literate adults 
face in the workforce and in daily life. Whether via direct service 
programs or advocacy efforts, Literacy KC seeks to address the 
consequences of low literacy--including an increased likelihood of 
poverty, incarceration, and health problems--for the 225,000 adults in 
the Kansas City area that are classified as low-literate.
  Literacy education provides innumerable benefits, both to individuals 
and to our society at large. Greater literacy rates are correlated with 
higher levels of economic output, improved health outcomes, heightened 
civic participation, and decreased crime levels. Beyond practical 
considerations, the ability to read opens a portal of knowledge, 
discovery, and imagination that can transport readers across time, 
throughout space, and beyond reality. Literacy KC does not just focus 
on the downstream consequences of illiteracy, but works with thousands 
of students each year to tap into the wellspring of opportunities that 
literacy provides, empowering learners with the tools needed to improve 
their own lives.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the work that Literacy KC 
has done to improve literacy rates throughout Missouri&#x27;s Fifth 
Congressional District. Since 1985, Literacy KC has offered hope to 
people in challenging situations and acted as a springboard for 
individuals that receive their services, propelling them to new 
heights. Whether helping students obtain their GEDs, study for 
citizenship exams, or pursue job-specific certifications, their 
services have left an indelible mark on our community, bringing great 
meaning, fulfillment, and empowerment to the lives of thousands. As we 
mark Literacy KC&#x27;s 40th anniversary this year, I am proud to 
commemorate their work and champion their mission of literacy for all.

     COMMEMORATION OF JUNETEENTH AMID THE EROSION OF BLACK HISTORY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANNY K. DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, June 20, 2025

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, after just four short years since 
I proudly cast my vote to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday

[[Page E595]]

through the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, the very history 
that this day honors is now under attack by the current administration. 
While we mark Juneteenth with prayers and proclamations, we must also 
confront a harsh and unsettling truth: the significance of this day and 
African American history is being erased. Across our Nation, we are 
witnessing the systemic losses of our hard-fought gains--the stripping 
of diversity, equity, and inclusion from federal institutions, 
censoring school curriculums, and silencing conversations about the 
true history of America.
  Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, the day Union troops arrived 
in Galveston, Texas, and informed over 250,000 enslaved Black people 
that they were free--more than two years after the Emancipation 
Proclamation. Juneteenth is a reminder that freedom and equality remain 
delayed for Black Americans. For generations, this history of 
intentional continuation of slavery was ignored, and, now that it is 
finally acknowledged as part of our Nation&#x27;s past, we see the Trump 
Administration trying to strip away Black history. Banning books, 
censoring lessons, and eliminating honest conversations about race is 
not about education, it is about control. We must ensure that 
Juneteenth is not just a day off but a day of truth.
  In 2005, I partnered with then-Senator Barack Obama to introduce 
legislation recognizing Juneteenth. And now that it has become law, we 
must defend it and the history it represents from being erased. The 
history of our people is not optional. Let me be clear: Black history 
is American history. As a Black man who was raised in the rural South 
during segregation, I know all too well what it feels like to be told 
that your history does not matter. As the Representative of the 7th 
Congressional District of Illinois, a district with a rich history of 
Black culture and resilience, I fight in Congress for equity, 
inclusion, and the honest American history.
  Today, the Trump Administration threatens Chicago Public Schools with 
the loss of over one billion dollars in federal funding for its efforts 
to improve the success and reduce suspensions of Black students, teach 
Black history, and recruit teachers who reflect the students they 
teach. African Americans have faced enormous challenges in every corner 
of life--education, economic security, health care, employment, housing 
and the criminal justice system. We are routinely denied opportunity 
solely because of the color of our skin. And still, we continue to 
fight for justice and equity in the face of deep-rooted, systemic 
racism.
  This Juneteenth, Chicago will celebrate Juneteenth as a testament to 
community, remembrance, and pride. There is the Pullman Porter Museum&#x27;s 
Juneteenth parade, games, and concert. Or the Cook County celebration 
at Malcolm X College, the Juneteenth Annual barbeque at the DuSable 
Black History Museum, or 1865 Fest in West Garfield Park, to name just 
a few. Events like these are not just festivals: they are declarations 
that we will not be silent. We will celebrate. We will educate. We will 
resist.
  I will continue to fight for equality and opportunity at every turn, 
while honoring the history my forefathers and foremothers endured. 
Let&#x27;s not forget, the White House and this country were built by 
enslaved labor. As we commemorate Juneteenth this year, let it be a 
call to action. The struggle for freedom will not end here. I am 
committed to protecting the truth of our past, fighting for justice in 
our present, and building a future where every African American can 
learn their history, see their worth, and know they belong.

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Edgar ``Pete&#x27;&#x27; Peters has been a dedicated and 
hardworking operations agent with Southwest Airlines for the past 27 
years. In 1998, the young Army veteran joined Southwest Airlines as a 
ramp agent in Baltimore, Maryland. He later accepted his current 
position and transferred to the Southwest Airlines operations in 
Orlando, Florida. Pete has worked in many capacities over the years, 
including as a member of the Safety and Emergency Care team, a 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion representative, and as a training 
coordinator. He has been awarded many honors, including Operations 
Agent of the Quarter on several occasions and Operations Agent of the 
Year.
  His passion for helping others and giving back to the community has 
led him to create The Ann Hewan Foundation, which contributes to his 
native Jamaica from his Lake Nona community in Central Florida. Pete, 
as he is known throughout the area and community, is heavily involved 
in charity work that supports underprivileged children. Each year, Pete 
collects, solicits, purchases, and ships back-to-school items, such as 
notebooks, pencils, backpacks, restored computers, and clothing items, 
to Jamaica, where he partners with a local school and charity in the 
community. Throughout the school year, he collects and donates some of 
his own money to help support the Goodwill Infant and Primary School 
Breakfast Program, which now operates three days a week, providing 
breakfast to underprivileged children at school who are unable to get 
it at home. Pete&#x27;s current project is assisting a local community 
charity in building a proper playing field for the kids at the Goodwill 
Primary and Infant School, which is almost 50% complete. The playing 
field will be used for recreational purposes and extracurricular 
activities, bringing joy and a sense of pride to the children and the 
community upon completion. Pete also helps out and supports local 
charity events around Central Florida communities and around the 
Southwest Airlines system.
  Pete&#x27;s dedication and low-key approach are what keep him going. As 
the son of Pinkie Hewan, who migrated to the United States in search of 
a better life, Pete&#x27;s passion and understanding create the high octane 
for helping others and treating them with respect.

                  FLORIDA FOR CARIBBEAN HERITAGE MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DARREN SOTO

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, June 20, 2025

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Patrina M. Lawrence is a dynamic and 
accomplished executive who has made a lasting impact on Florida&#x27;s Ninth 
Congressional District through her leadership in behavioral health and 
social services. As the founder and chief executive officer of Serving 
Children and Reaching Families (SCARF), a community-based mental health 
organization headquartered in Kissimmee, Florida, Ms. Lawrence has led 
efforts to deliver high-quality, culturally responsive, and trauma-
informed care to children and families across Central Florida since 
2013.
  Guided by the belief that ``safety and security don&#x27;t just happen--
they are the result of collective consensus and public investment,&#x27;&#x27; as 
Nelson Mandela once said, Ms. Lawrence has dedicated her career to 
building systems that protect and uplift the most vulnerable. Through 
SCARF, she has expanded access to mental health services, secured 
funding from the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Department of 
Health, and Osceola County Schools, and fostered long-standing 
partnerships with the Department of Children and Families and regional 
managing entities.
  Through an eight-year partnership with the Florida Department of 
Children and Families, Ms. Lawrence was instrumental in creating a 
diversion program that has helped strengthen families and successfully 
diverted over 500 children annually from entering the foster care 
system. A licensed clinical social worker and seasoned clinician, Ms. 
Lawrence has provided direct care and clinical oversight to hundreds of 
clients. She has authored SCARF&#x27;s operational policies and training 
curricula, helping to elevate standards across Florida&#x27;s behavioral 
health workforce. Her work has not only improved outcomes but also 
ensured service fidelity and compliance with state regulations.
  Ms. Lawrence holds an advanced degree in social work from Howard 
University and has completed executive education at Harvard University 
in leadership, business strategy, and public health equity. Her work 
embodies a commitment to access, quality, and innovation in behavioral 
health for Florida&#x27;s most vulnerable populations.

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Roberto Smith has dedicated his career to 
advancing technology and improving lives within the community. With 
over two decades of experience in the information technology field,

certifications in computer networking and systems engineering,

engineer, where his dedication and technical acumen led to his 
promotion to network manager and later, IT director.
  As IT director, Roberto has spearheaded numerous initiatives that 
have enhanced the city&#x27;s technological landscape. Under his leadership, 
the implementation of Microsoft 365 has provided city employees with

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA LOCAL JUROR NON-DISCRIMINATION 
                              ACT OF 2025

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, June 20, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the District of Columbia 
Local Juror Non-Discrimination Act of 2025. This bill would clarify 
that D.C. residents may not be excluded or disqualified from jury 
service in the local D.C. trial court, the D.C. Superior Court, based 
on sexual orientation or gender identity. Specifically, this bill would 
clarify that the term ``sex,&#x27;&#x27; which is a protected class under the 
non-discrimination law that applies to jurors in the D.C. Superior 
Court, includes sexual orientation and gender identity. The term 
``sex&#x27;&#x27; would also include a sex stereotype; pregnancy, childbirth or 
related medical condition; and sex characteristics, including intersex 
traits. In the 117th Congress, the House Committee on Oversight and 
Reform passed a version of this bill.
  D.C. has one of the strongest non-discrimination laws in the country, 
including protecting individuals based on sexual orientation and gender 
identity. However, under the D.C. Home Rule Act, the D.C. Council does 
not have the authority to amend title 11 of the D.C. Code, which 
contains the non-discrimination provisions that apply to jurors in the 
D.C. Superior Court. Therefore, until D.C. is given authority to amend 
title 11 of the D.C. Code, which one of my bills would do, an act of 
Congress is required to clarify that LGBTQ+ jurors in the D.C. Superior 
Court are protected from discrimination.
  As the Supreme Court said in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company, 
``discrimination within the courtroom raises serious questions as to 
the fairness of the proceedings conducted there. . . . [B]ias mars the 
integrity of the judicial system and prevents the idea of democratic 
government from becoming a reality.&#x27;&#x27; Similarly, the Court, in Batson 
v. Kentucky, which was a juror discrimination case based on race, said, 
``The harm from discriminatory jury selection extends beyond that 
inflicted on the defendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire 
community. Selection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons 
from juries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system 
of justice.&#x27;&#x27;
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, June 20, 2025

  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Bellevue-Papillion 
Rotary Club of Nebraska on the celebration of their 50th Anniversary.
  Since its founding on January 15, 1975, the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary 
Club has exemplified the values of Rotary International by promoting 
peace, advancing education, and delivering vital services to the 
community. Over the past five decades this organization has remained a 
steadfast force for good in Eastern Sarpy County and beyond.
  The club&#x27;s service includes providing college scholarships to local 
students, honoring outstanding educators, and awarding community 
grants, their work has supported organizations such as the Bellevue 
food Pantry. Habitat for Humanity, and a local shelter for survivors of 
human trafficking. The club has also funded the installation of police 
dash cameras, contributed to holiday food programs, and invested in 
public amenities such as the gazebo at the Eastern Nebraska Veterans 
Home and benches at Papillion Landing.
  In moments of crisis, the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary club has stepped 
up, including providing direct assistance to children affected by the 
2019 floods. The club also supports global initiatives, including polio 
eradication and health assistance in Africa.
  The rotary motto, ``Service Above Self&#x27;&#x27;, is more than a guiding 
principle--it&#x27;s a commitment the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary Club has 
lived every day for 50 years. Its members have made immeasurable 
contributions to the community and have set an example of civic 
responsibility and service.
  I commend the Bellevue-Papillion Rotary Club for its remarkable 
legacy and congratulate its members on this milestone anniversary.
