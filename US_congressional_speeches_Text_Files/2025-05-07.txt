     HONORING THE CAREER ACHIEVEMENTS OF MS. CHRISTINA L. RICHARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. DON BACON

                              of nebraska

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 7, 2025

  Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional career 
achievements of Ms. Christina L. Richards, a committed civil servant, 
decorated veteran, and a constituent of the 2nd Congressional District 
of our great state of Nebraska. Today she works as Executive Director 
of the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Strategic 
Command at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. In this role she is 
responsible for overseeing the Inspector General&#x27;s staff which includes 
conducting Inspector General inquiries, analysis, investigations and 
inspections, as well as providing technical advice for the command.
  She previously served in the U.S. Air Force for over 21 years, where 
her hard work and dedication enabled her to work her way to the top. 
Ms. Richards started her military service as an Air Force loadmaster 
where she worked on over twenty campaigns and operations. She then 
served as adjutant for a KC-135 training squadron and later as Chief of 
Protocol at Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma. As she advanced in rank 
and experience, Ms. Richards was given more authority and 
responsibility, ultimately becoming a Detachment Commander with the Air 
Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). In this position she 
performed critical work in Colorado, California, Hawaii, the Republic 
of Korea, and Qatar. As an AFOSI Detachment Commander she directed 
felony-level criminal investigations, counterterrorism operations, 
protection of the President, and defensive and offensive 
counterintelligence and counterespionage operations.
  After retiring from the Air Force, Ms. Richards continued to serve 
her country. Among her many positions, she served for more than six 
years in United States Strategic Command&#x27;s Missile Defense and 
Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction Division, where she led the 
command&#x27;s Missile Defense Issue Team, several Deputy Secretary of 
Defense-directed Strategic Portfolio Reviews, the Secretary of Defense 
Combatant Command Review 1.0 and 2.0 for missile defense matters, and 
the President of the United States-directed 2019 Missile Defense 
Review. She co-authored a proposal for transfer of the missile defense 
mission from USSTRATCOM that was ultimately accepted and included in 
the 2022 Unified Command Plan.
  Ms. Richards&#x27; major awards include the Omaha-Lincoln Federal 
Executive Association Team of the Year and Supervisory Employee of the 
Year; DoD&#x27;s Best Force Protection Program Team Award; the FBI 
Director&#x27;s Award for Exceptional Service in the Public Trust; and 
multiple awards of the Meritorious Service Medal; the Air Medal; the 
Aerial Achievement Medal; the Meritorious Unit Award; the USAF 
Outstanding Unit Award; the Combat Readiness Medal; and other military 
medals and decorations.
  Ms. Christina Richards&#x27; dedication, service, and leadership stands as 
a testament to the hard work and loyalty of the service men and women 
of our country and is an inspiration for future civil servants and 
members of the United States Armed Forces.

                         HONORING TONY REINHART

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. SAM GRAVES

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 7, 2025

  Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize a dedicated 
constituent of Missouri&#x27;s Sixth Congressional District: Mr. Tony 
Reinhart. Tony is celebrating his thirtieth year with Ford Motor 
Company, a remarkable professional milestone. Tony&#x27;s three decades of 
devoted service is an exceptional achievement that reflects his deep 
commitment, expertise, and enduring leadership within one of America&#x27;s 
most iconic corporations.
  Throughout his tenure, Tony has held various critical roles. He 
currently serves as Ford

[[Page E399]]

Motor Company&#x27;s Head of State, Local and Stakeholder Government 
Affairs. In this vital capacity, he leads a team to navigate the 
complex systems of state and local governments in order to strengthen 
the American auto industry.
  However, Tony&#x27;s influence extends well beyond his role with Ford 
Motor Company. He serves as Vice Chair of the Ford Civic Action Fund, a 
member of the Executive Committee of the Alliance for Automotive 
Innovation, and former Chairman of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry 
Association. These underscore his significant contributions to shaping 
the automotive landscape and public policy for the industry.
  Tony&#x27;s service extends deep into the community. He has served in many 
roles in the Sixth Congressional District of Missouri and the Northland 
of Kansas City, Missouri, as he has worked to make it a better place to 
live and work. He serves on the Board of Directors for both the 
Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce and Liberty Economic Development 
Corporation. He is the President of the Northland CAPS Board of 
Directors. He is the Chairperson of the Board of Directors for the 
Kansas City Zoo and sits on the Advisory Council of the North Kansas 
City Hospital. He is the Past Chair Advisor for the Clay County 
Economic Development Council. His service and commitment to our 
community is deep and the impact is tremendous.
  As a native of Lexington, Missouri, and a proud graduate of Drury 
University in Springfield, Missouri, Tony&#x27;s roots are firmly planted in 
our state, and we are incredibly proud to count him a Missourian. I am 
proud to call him a friend.
  A strong American auto industry means a strong American economy. We 
live and breathe that in Missouri. Ford&#x27;s Kansas City Assembly plant 
makes the best-selling vehicle in America, creating jobs not only at 
the plant, but at dealerships, suppliers, and other parts of the 
community. Tony&#x27;s work at Ford helps the company invest in local 
communities and make an impact both in Missouri and across the country.
  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me and the people of 
Missouri&#x27;s Sixth Congressional District in congratulating Tony Reinhart 
on his incredible professional milestone. I am proud to represent Tony 
in the United States House of Representatives and wish him continued 
success in his career.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Joanne Gillespie has made to our community through 
her volunteerism at NAMI Hernando. Joanne is a retired Exceptional 
Student Education (ESE) teacher and current Board Secretary of NAMI 
Hernando since 2017. In these roles, she has been a dedicated champion 
for mental health education and inclusion. As the mother of an adult 
son living with schizophrenia, Joanne brings both personal insight and 
professional experience to everything she does. NAMI is grounded in the 
power of lived experience, and Joanne embodies that mission 
wholeheartedly. For eight years, Joanne has taught Family-to-Family 
classes and led Family Support Groups, offering encouragement and 
understanding to others walking a similar path. She is also a certified 
instructor for Mental Health First Aid and Wellness Recovery Action 
Plan (WRAP), further extending her impact in the community. In addition 
to her peer support and education roles, Joanne chairs NAMI Hernando&#x27;s 
Fundraising Committee and has been an active contributor to the Finance 
Committee, helping guide sustainable growth for the organization. Her 
thoughtful insight and nurturing spirit bring clarity and compassion to 
board decisions, and she has played a key role in streamlining internal 
communications and administrative processes. Joanne&#x27;s background as an 
educator gives her a unique perspective on the emotional and 
developmental needs of families and youth. She frequently goes above 
and beyond to offer support, guidance, and hope to those navigating 
complex mental health systems. Whether advocating for youth mental 
health, organizing community events, or mentoring families, Joanne is a 
voice of wisdom, patience, and grace.
  It is clear Joanne Gillespie has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to 
serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

                         Wednesday, May 7, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Joan Moore has made through her work with Gulfside 
Healthcare Services. Since February 2022, Joan Moore has touched the 
lives of over 10,000 hospice patients and their families through giving 
her time, talent, and treasure with Gulfside Hospice. With a servant&#x27;s 
heart, Joan quietly, yet passionately finds ways to support one of the 
most vulnerable groups in her community--the elderly. Joan&#x27;s journey 
into volunteering began later in life. At nearly 79 years old, instead 
of slowing down, she stepped up when she heard Gulfside needed 
volunteers. In just three years, she has donated more than 3,650 hours 
of her time to Gulfside Hospice.
  Inspired by her mother, a longtime hospice volunteer, Joan has always 
felt a deep connection to those in hospice care. Facing her own health 
challenges, including chronic pain and limited mobility, only deepened 
her empathy. Now retired from a successful career in sales and as a 
former actress and model, Joan remains driven to stay active and give 
back.
  She began by helping with clerical tasks in Gulfside&#x27;s Philanthropy 
department and soon joined the Women for Gulfside group in May 2022. 
Since then, she has played a key role in fundraising efforts supporting 
programs that rely entirely on donations, such as care for uninsured 
patients, family bereavement support, and Pet Peace of Mind&lt;register&gt;, 
which helps hospice patients care for their pets. Joan also contributes 
to Gulfside&#x27;s four major annual fundraising events, offering hands-on 
help, inkind donations, and support wherever it&#x27;s needed. In 2024, Joan 
made a generous gift to the Raising Hope for Hospice capital campaign 
to help build a new in-patient unit in New Port Richey. The soon-to-
open Gulfside Center for Hospice Care will provide 24-hour support for 
patients in their final days, meeting a critical need, thanks in part 
to donors, like Joan. Now nearly 82, Joan&#x27;s energy, wit, and compassion 
continue to inspire everyone she meets. While many her age focus on 
slowing down, Joan stays energized and youthful by serving others. Her 
mind is always on how to help--then doing exactly that. Joan is truly a 
Hero Among Us. As she puts it, ``I started volunteering to help others 
but never realized it would help me too. It has given me more joy than 
I could ever imagine. Volunteering for hospice saved my life, and I 
hope it does the same for others too.&#x27;&#x27;
  It is clear Joan Moore has made a profoundly positive impact on our 
commuity, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to serve 
our communities with the same dedication and humility.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that John Wajdowicz has made through his work at The 
Pasco County Sheriff&#x27;s Citizen Service Unit (CSU). A truly dedicated 
public servant, John always carries himself with professionalism and is 
quick to offer a helping hand to anybody who needs one. John has been 
volunteering with the Pasco Sheriff&#x27;s Office since 2021. He usually 
volunteers at least three days a week, as well as most special events 
that the CSU is asked to help out with. John is relied upon throughout 
the year to train new CSU members. During the year 2024, John provided 
the agency and his community with 1,320.25 volunteer hours. John has 
been instrumental in updating forms and practices within the CSU. His 
input has been especially helpful in the creation of an electronic 
Daily Activity Report, which captures trackable information pertaining 
to the calls-for-service handled by CSU Volunteers. John is a 
tremendous asset to the CSU, Pasco Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the citizens 
of Pasco County. His hard work and selflessness is deserving of 
recognition, although that is not why he volunteers his time to help 
others. John exemplifies what it means to be a hero.
  It is clear John Wajdowicz has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to 
serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

                         Wednesday, May 7, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Jordan French has made through his work with the 
Pasco County Human Services Team. The Pasco County Human Services Team 
has proven itself to be a cornerstone of resilience, innovation, and 
unwavering commitment to the community. Amidst the devastating impacts 
of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, they emerged as an indispensable 
force, transforming challenges into triumphs and ensuring no resident 
was left behind. The team managed and helped coordinate efforts for 
shelters that housed 485 residents. When Hurricane Milton struck 
shortly thereafter, the team rose to even greater heights, coordinating 
shelters for 5,800 individuals and 1,315 animals--an extraordinary feat 
of operational precision and compassion. Despite personal hardships, 
including one case manager losing her home while another lost her 
rental property, the team prioritized the welfare of the community, 
working tirelessly to ensure safety and stability for all. Post-storm, 
the team was responsible for helping shelter residents whose homes were 
no longer safe, find appropriate alternatives for housing. Their 
dedication shone through in rapid response efforts. In the days 
immediately following Hurricane Helene, 49 residents received critical 
assessments and essential resources. After Hurricane Milton, they 
worked with 225 displaced individuals who remained in shelters, 
demonstrating their unparalleled ability to adapt and respond under 
pressure. The team leveraged the Human Services Needs app to streamline 
disaster case management, supporting 1,351 residents. Their follow-up 
system, in partnership with other agencies, ensured personalized 
service for every individual. This innovative approach epitomized their 
ability to harness technology and partnerships for meaningful impact. 
Beyond immediate relief, the team worked with individuals and families 
who would require long-term recovery efforts. For approximately 150 
permanently displaced residents, they implemented a housing eligibility 
process, with the intent of ensuring fair and transparent allocation of 
resources. By securing placements at facilities like Pasco Hope, the 
team supported individuals and families along a pathway to rebuild 
their lives. Between September 28 and October 18, 2024, the team 
managed an overwhelming volume of calls--1,194 through their direct 
line and another 1,214 through work phones. Yet every call was met with 
care, professionalism, and actionable solutions, reflecting the team&#x27;s 
deep commitment to being a lifeline for the community. The Pasco County 
Human Services Team exemplifies what it means to serve with excellence, 
compassion, and innovation. Their remarkable achievements during 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton, coupled with their dedication to long-
term recovery and cutting-edge approaches to disaster management, have 
left an indelible mark on Pasco County. For their tireless service, 
extraordinary impact, and embodiment of resilience, the Pasco County 
Human Services Team is a truly deserving nominee for the Heros Among Us 
Award.
  It is clear Jordan French has made a profoundly positive impact on

                         ROSE-HELENE SPREIREGEN

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 7, 2025

  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record remarks from 
Rose-Helene Spreiregen, a holocaust survivor.

       Never, as a young Jewish girl hiding in France during World 
     War II, could I have possibly dreamed of standing where I am 
     now. Never could I have imagined addressing democratically 
     elected representatives, in a country where people can live 
     freely, a country that I love.
       My name is Rose-Helene Spreiregen. I was born in Paris in 
     1931 into a family that fled Poland in the late 1920s because 
     of antisemitism. Little could they imagine what was to happen 
     a decade later.
       Germany invaded Western Europe in May 1940. France fell a 
     month after, and Nazi occupation began immediately. Jews were 
     ordered to register with the police, who became close 
     collaborators with the occupiers. Anti-Jewish laws and acts 
     of discrimination quickly followed. Jews could not go to 
     restaurants, to movie theaters, not even parks. They could 
     not own radios or telephones. They could not be out after 
     6:00 p.m. It got only worse.
       In 1942, every Jewish person over six years old was issued 
     three yellow Stars of David inscribed with the word ``JUIF&#x27;&#x27; 
     (Jew in French). It had to be sewn on an outer garment. Jews 
     could shop only one hour a day at a time when stores were 
     mostly sold out of goods. On the Metro subway, they were 
     restricted to the last car. They could not travel more than 
     17 miles from Paris.
       I stopped going to school in July 1942 because Jewish 
     children were pulled from their classrooms by collaborating 
     police and deported with their families to Nazi concentration 
     camps.
       More than 13,000 Jews were arrested that same month, most 
     were sent to their deaths. Luckily, my mother was warned by a 
     sympathetic policeman. Immediately she went into hiding. She 
     then obtained forged identity papers and, with the help of a 
     smuggler, set out to cross the border from Nazi-occupied 
     northern France into French-controlled southern France--so-
     called Vichy France--but still equally dangerous for Jews. 
     Instead of helping her cross the border, the smuggler 
     betrayed her, and she was arrested. She was then sent to 
     Drancy, an infamous rail juncture and holding town just north 
     of Paris. From there, its prisoners were transported to 
     concentration or death camps.
       Grandmother and I stayed hidden in my mother&#x27;s apartment 
     for a year, never leaving for fear of being arrested or 
     worse. I went out alone to get food. Every day I stood in 
     lines, unable to conceal my Star of David, and because of it, 
     I was cursed as a ``dirty Jew.&#x27;&#x27; From our window, we saw 
     other families being pulled from their apartments and hauled 
     away in trucks.
       In August 1943, grandmother decided we had to flee Paris. 
     We obtained false identity papers with new names and equally 
     false personal information. We departed from Paris on an 
     overnight train that would pass through two border control 
     checkpoints, the first under German control, the second under 
     French. I decided to take charge for us since grandmother 
     spoke with a thick Polish accent--a giveaway. I told her to 
     pretend she was asleep. When the German soldiers came to 
     check our papers, I asked them not to wake her. They 
     complied. At the second checkpoint, controlled by the French, 
     I made the same request. Miraculously it worked. We got 
     through. In all those years of living in near unbearable 
     fear, none had been more terrifying than those border 
     passings. I couldn&#x27;t stop shaking for hours after.
       I was twelve years old.
       We found our way to the small and remote mountain town of 
     Voiron in east central France. My aunt and younger cousin had 
     successfully made the same journey to a nearby town. 
     Grandmother and I found a place to stay in what I recall as a 
     warehouse. We had no furniture. but a kind neighbor gave us a 
     mattress, a small cooking stove which helped keep us warm, 
     and other utensils.
       I found a job running a small grocery. I was paid meager 
     wages. Grandmother mended clothing and bartered her wine 
     rations for food. We scoured the nearby forest for chestnuts 
     and firewood. My only warm dress, made from a blanket, was 
     destroyed beyond use by mice.
       Deliverance finally came with the liberation of Voiron in 
     August 1944 by American soldiers, the ``greatest 
     generation,&#x27;&#x27; the generation of many of your grandparents. 
     They gave us crackers, chocolate, and, of all things, chewing 
     gum, something I&#x27;d never known. But above all, they gave us 
     freedom. Still, I had no knowledge of my mother&#x27;s fate. I 
     kept hoping she would come back. She never did. Later I 
     learned what happened. At Drancy, she had volunteered to 
     accompany a trainload of children to Auschwitz, 1,000 miles 
     east, a horrific journey of several days and nights. They 
     were packed into freight cars like animals. No water. No 
     food. No sanitation. No windows. No place to sit let alone 
     room to lie down. All this was in the heat of August. Upon 
     arrival, all who survived the journey were murdered in gas 
     chambers. Such was my mother&#x27;s fate.
       She was thirty-one years old.
       It is always difficult for me to tell my story. But I am 
     compelled to tell it because of the global surge in 
     antisemitism, including here in the United States. While it 
     is reassuring that our government--in your hands--is 
     addressing it at the highest levels, it is troubling that it 
     has to be addressed at all. It doesn&#x27;t take much history to 
     teach us that what starts with hatred of the Jewish people 
     does not end there.
       What are the conditions that nurture antisemitism? 
     Ignorance. Intolerance. Indifference. Injustice. That is why 
     Holocaust education is so vital. That is why this country 
     must again lead this fight, as it has done for just causes so 
     often and so nobly in the past.

       That is my story.
