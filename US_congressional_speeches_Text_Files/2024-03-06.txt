        CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF DR. GUBAD IBADOGHLU

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JAMIE RASKIN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Government of 
Azerbaijan to immediately release Dr. Gubad Ibadoghlu, a courageous 
pro-democracy activist, brilliant economist, and beloved husband and 
father, who has been unjustly detained for over seven months.

[[Page E221]]

  On July 23, 2023, Dr. Ibadoghlu and his wife, Irada Bayramova, were 
forced out of their car near Baku, Azerbaijan, seized by masked 
individuals, detained, and beaten. Dr. Ibadoghlu had returned to 
Azerbaijan earlier in July from a visiting fellowship at the London 
School of Economics to care for his ailing mother. Though Ms. Bayramova 
was released hours later, Dr. Ibadoghlu was not released. Ms. Bayramova 
and her family have been denied communication with her husband and she 
continues to expenence Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from this 
harrowing ordeal. The ``charges&#x27;&#x27; that President Ilham Aliyev&#x27;s 
government has used to justify Dr. Ibadoghlu&#x27;s detention and 
imprisonment without trial--that he organized the production of 
counterfeit money to support a political group and, as an avowed 
secularist, disseminates material that supports religious extremism--
are so dubious and baseless that they would qualify as satire in 
another context.
  Dr. Ibadoghlu&#x27;s true ``crime&#x27;&#x27; against the Aliyev regime is his 
devotion to the causes of democracy, freedom and anti-corruption in 
Azerbaijan. He is detained today because he bravely chose to return to 
Azerbaijan to care for his mother despite fleeing the country in 2017 
to teach abroad after his civic activism prompted threats of 
retaliation. As an internationally acclaimed economist, he has also 
served as a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill, Duke University, and Rutgers University. He was a 2015 
Fulbright Scholar, a 2015 Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at the 
National Endowment for Democracy, a 2018 Prague Civil Society Center 
Fellow, and a recipient of the 2018 Civil Society Scholar Award by the 
Open Society Fund.
  During Dr. Ibadoghlu&#x27;s seven-month detention, he has been subjected 
to crowded and inhumane conditions common to Azerbaijan&#x27;s jails and 
denied sustained access to critical medication. Dr. Ibadoghlu&#x27;s family 
is increasingly concerned that he has been denied the medication and 
medical treatment that he desperately needs to treat his chronic health 
conditions. He has additionally been repeatedly denied access to his 
legal counsel and has not received a fair trial while in custody. I 
join my fellow Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. 
Department of State, the U.S. Embassy in Baku, U.S. academic 
institutions and organizations, the European Parliament, and others in 
the international community to express my deep concerns about Dr. 
Ibadoghlu&#x27;s health and demand his immediate release.
  I commend Emin Bayramli, one of Dr. Ibadoghlu&#x27;s sons who lives in my 
district, and his entire family for their steadfastness in seeking 
their father&#x27;s freedom from his unjust imprisonment. I also commend my 
colleague Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey for adopting Dr. 
Ibadoghlu through the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission&#x27;s Defending 
Freedoms Project.
  Dr. Ibadoghlu is one of far too many Azerbaijanis that the Aliyev 
regime has unjustly detained to suppress freedom and civil rights. The 
Government of Azerbaijan&#x27;s poor record of respecting human rights, 
civil rights and civil liberties is a moral stain that affects free 
people everywhere. Whether they live in Washington, D.C. or Baku, Hong 
Kong or Beijing, Moscow or Kyiv, everyone should have the right to 
determine their own destiny. Dr. Ibadoghlu&#x27;s unjust imprisonment must 
end immediately.

                      HONORING DENNIS JOHN BENIGNO

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the inspiring 
life of Dennis John Benigno. A resident of the City of Clifton, Dennis 
John was debilitated by a traumatic brain injury when he was fifteen 
years old. The injury that befell Dennis John would have crushed weaker 
spirits. But instead of shrinking, Dennis John and his family used it 
to change the world.
  Back in 1984 when Dennis John suffered his injury, few people 
anywhere knew about Traumatic Brain Injury. Information was sparse, 
even among doctors. The knowledge gap was enormous. Dennis John helped 
change all of that. The Benigno family drive was tireless, the founding 
of the Coalition for Brain Injury Research a watershed.
  I first met Dennis John when I was running for Congress in 1996. His 
story inspired me to learn more about the issue and advocate for people 
with brain injuries. It is thanks to Dennis John&#x27;s inspiration that I 
founded, alongside my friend Former Representative Jim Greenwood (R-
PA), the bipartisan Congressional Brain Injury Task Force in 2001. At 
first, you could fit our caucus members into a phone book. Now, there 
are dozens of members on our task force.
  For 23 years, the task force has brought together thousands of 
families, advocates, and doctors. We have enacted laws, created 
policies, won hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, made 
important connections and told countless stories. These are people who 
would have never met and laws that would have never passed had it not 
been for Dennis John Benigno. Other accident victims, military 
servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan, those participating in 
youth sports, and millions of people across the spectrum helped because 
the Congress was aware and ready to support our TBI victims.
  Regrettably, Dennis John passed away on January 24, 2024. It is true 
that we have yet to find the TBI cure we have prayed for, and I have 
deep regret for that. But when people cynically say no one person can 
make any difference in our world, they are wrong. They did not know 
Dennis John Benigno. So, while we mourn a life lost, we celebrate 
something even bigger a life that lifted up so many others by sheer 
power and love.
  Today, we are hosting Brain Injury Day on Capitol Hill. Hundreds of 
brain injury victims, advocates, and caregivers from across the nation 
have come to Washington to educate Congress on the steps we can take to 
fund and support care for brain injury victims as we fight for a cure. 
This year&#x27;s Brain Injury Day is in honor of Dennis John Benigno&#x27;s life. 
I do not know if I would be here fighting for this worthy cause if not 
for Dennis John&#x27;s inspiration.
  The House sends its condolences to Dennis John&#x27;s parents, Dennis and 
Rosalind Benigno, his sister Kim Lyons, her husband William, as well as 
his aunts, uncles, nephews, and cousins. May God bless Dennis John 
Benigno. God bless his entire family. And God bless America.

        HONORING EAGLE SCOUT FRANKLIN LUCORE OF MONETT, MISSOURI

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ERIC BURLISON

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Franklin Lucore of 
Monett, Missouri, who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout just prior to 
his 15th birthday. Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the 
Boy Scouts of America program, and since its inception in 1911, only 4 
percent of scouts have earned this rank after a lengthy review process.
  Franklin is a freshman in the International Baccalaureate Program at 
Central High School in Springfield and a member of BSA Troop 38 in 
Monett. He began his scouting career as a Cub Scout at the age of seven 
and since then has held numerous leadership positions with the troop, 
while also maintaining a 4.0 grade point average in school. He is a 
member of the Brotherhood of the Order of the Arrow, scouting&#x27;s 
National Honor Society, and a member of the Tribe of the Lone Bear, an 
honors program of the Ozark Trails Council&#x27;s Camp Arrowhead. He also 
has earned 36 merit badges, camped out more than 50 nights, hiked more 
than 100 miles and performed more than 36 hours of community service.

[[Page E222]]

  His Eagle Scout project provided improvements and outdoor furnishing 
to South Park, a 65-acre park owned by the city of Monett that caters 
especially to children and adults with disabilities.
  Scouting has been teaching valuable lessons in leadership since it 
was established in February 1910, and achieving the rank of Eagle Scout 
is an important accomplishment. This young man deserves our applause 
for a job well done. I am proud to have him as a constituent.

                           HON. ERIC BURLISON

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jackson Choi of 
Springfield, Missouri, who recently achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. 
Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America 
program. Since its inception in 1911, only 4 percent of scouts have 
earned this rank after a lengthy review process.
  Jackson is a junior at Kickapoo High School in Springfield, and he 
has been in scouting since he joined as a Cub Scout in 2013. He is a 
member of Troop No. 289, where he has held several leadership 
positions. He also has attended three of the four high adventure camps 
earning him the Triple Crown Award from the Boy Scouts of America.
  To earn the Eagle Scout designation, each individual must complete a 
project. Jackson&#x27;s project was to update the bamboo fencing at the 
Mizumoto Japanese Stroll Garden at the Nathaniel Green/Close Memorial 
Park in Springfield. The garden was established by Springfield&#x27;s 
Japanese sister city in 1985. The original bamboo fencing had fallen 
into disrepair, so Jackson studied the process and replaced 100-feet of 
fencing in the traditional Japanese way.
  This accomplished young man deserves our applause for a job well 
done. I am proud to have him as a constituent.

  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize 
Nicholas Charles Nesslage. Nicholas is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by 
taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 495, and 
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.
  Nicholas has been very active with his troop, participating in many 
Scout activities. Over the many years Nicholas has been involved with 
Scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the 
respect of his family, peers, and community. Nicholas has also 
contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Nicholas 
created a gravel water runoff area at his local park in Weatherby Lake 
to combat flooding.
  Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Nicholas 
Charles Nesslage for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America 
and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
congratulate Abilities of Northwest Jersey on their 50th Anniversary.
  Over 50 years ago, a group of 14 grassroot advocates, including 
parents and members of the New Jersey community, came together to 
incorporate Abilities of Northwest Jersey as an organization fulfilling 
the vocational needs of adults with developmental and intellectual 
disabilities. Starting as a small workshop serving 13 individuals in 
Washington, NJ and partnering with local companies, this group of 
advocates had a mission to improve the employability and quality of 
life for people with disabilities, leading to their sense of self-worth 
and independence. Thanks to their efforts, Abilities was legally 
incorporated in 1974.
  Since that time, Abilities have grown exponentially, serving 
individuals of all levels of abilities, through the expansion of 
various programs and services. Abilities now serves over 375 
individuals and their families throughout the northwest region of the 
state. They are not only the disability employment experts for this 
region, but the professional staff also support those who are 
significantly challenged with medical or behavioral needs. Their 
services are both exemplary and accredited by CARE International. They 
have also opened a variety of Social Enterprises that offer vocational 
training opportunities as well as a valued service to our community--
PrintAbilities, SustainAbilities Electronics Recycling and 
PossAbilities Thrift Boutiques.
  I am so proud of their accomplishments, the positive impact they have 
made on thousands of lives, and the exciting future that lies ahead.

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues, Representatives Levin, 
Sanchez, and Napolitano, and rise today to honor the life of Raymond 
``Ray&#x27;&#x27; L. Cordova, a renowned labor leader who leaves behind a legacy 
of service.
  Ray cut his teeth as an organizer in the early 1960s as part of the 
Freedom Summer Movement in Mississippi for almost two years. A proud 
veteran of the U.S. Army Airborne, his service to his country continued 
after the Vietnam War when he returned home to build up his community. 
He was always a dapper dresser and treated everyone with respect. In a 
short time, Ray began making his name known as one of the most 
effective and impactful labor leaders in Orange County.
  No matter what or who you believed in--if you were a Republican, 
Democrat, or something in between--Ray was a champion of all people. 
When working men and women across America had no seat at the table, Ray 
fought tirelessly to make room through his leadership in the 
Communications Workers of America Union and as a labor organizer in 
Orange County.
  Ray&#x27;s influence and impact extends beyond his labor work. He educated 
and prepared the next generation of the labor movement, and helped 
redefine politics in Southern California. It is because of his 
mentorship that so many of the leaders of today are prepared to make 
the changes they envision, in California and beyond.
  Not only was he a deeply loved member of our community, but my 
colleagues and I are lucky that Ray was also a dear friend. I have 
personally had the pleasure of knowing and learning from him over the 
last 25 years.
  I ask my colleagues to join me and Representatives Levin, Sanchez, 
and Napolitano in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy of 
Raymond ``Ray&#x27;&#x27; L. Cordova. I thank Ray for setting an example of 
leadership and service that we all may aspire to and learn from.

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent 
Captain Kevin Mitchell of the Kingsport Fire Department in Kingsport, 
Tennessee, who is retiring after more than 26 years of dedicated 
service to our community.
  Captain Mitchell began his Journey with the Kingsport Fire Department 
on September 2, 1997. Over the span of his illustrious career, he has 
not only served as a firefighter, but also advanced to become a 
paramedic serving in this capacity for over two decades. His dedication 
to continued education extended far beyond his immediate duties as a 
respected instructor in both fire service and medical fields, where he 
taught crucial lifesaving techniques such as CPR, Pediatric Advanced 
Life Support (PALS), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), and more.
  Beginning his career as a firefighter, Captain Mitchell was soon 
promoted to the position of engineer, where he was responsible for 
driving and operating complex firefighting vehicles. He continued to 
rise through the ranks in recognition of his exceptional service, 
culminating in his promotion to Captain, a role he held until his 
retirement. His commitment to safety and excellence led him to join the 
Kingsport Fire Department Technical Rescue Team, where he specialized 
in Search &amp; Rescue, Swift Water Rescue, Confined Space, High &amp; Low 
Angle Rope Rescue, Trench Rescue, and Structural Collapse. His 
leadership and expertise in these areas earned him the role of 
Technical Rescue Team Leader.
  In addition to his remarkable service at the Kingsport Fire 
Department, Captain Mitchell also dedicated eight years as a member of 
the State of Tennessee Emergency Service Board in Nashville, where he 
played a pivotal role in regulating EMS activities across the state.
  His service to the community extended well beyond his professional 
obligations to include his participation with the Big Brother/Big 
Sister Program of East Tennessee, H.O.P.E. (Help Our Potential Evolve), 
the Kingsport Life Saving Crew, and the Kingsport Firefighters 
Association Local 2270. His advocacy efforts also saw him participate 
in state legislation, lobbying for the rights and welfare of 
firefighters across Tennessee, advocating on critical issues like PTSD 
and cancer.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Captain Kevin 
Mitchell for his outstanding service to the Kingsport Fire Department 
and the citizens of Kingsport, Tennessee. His retirement marks the end 
of an era of exceptional service and leadership, and his legacy will 
continue to inspire current and future generations of public servants. 
We wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the other week, we lost a great American, 
renowned civil rights activist, and legendary radio host: Joe Madison. 
He passed away on January 31 at age 74. Some knew Joe as `the Judge&#x27; 
who would hear out his callers and guests even if they had different 
views but cut them off if they tried to spread misinformation. Others 
knew him as `the Black Eagle&#x27;--his longtime radio nickname. I had the 
pleasure of knowing him as a friend and as a crucial member of the 
local community. Regardless of how we knew Joe, however, we all 
recognized him for who he was: a man of supreme integrity, character, 
and intellect.
  The airwaves defined Joe&#x27;s life, and Joe&#x27;s life defined the airwaves. 
From the start of his radio career as a DJ for the campus station at 
Washington University in St. Louis to its end on SiriuxXM&#x27;s Urban View 
with a daily listenership in the tens of millions, Joe captivated his 
listeners. They knew they could trust Joe. He made a point never to 
violate that trust.
  Joe understood both the nuances of radio as a medium and its power to 
change minds and change the country. Before his radio career took off, 
Joe was a leading figure in the Detroit chapter of the NAACP. He was 
only 24 when he became executive director of the Detroit branch of the 
organization--the youngest person in history to hold the position. 
Never losing sight of his roots in advocacy, Joe used his platform on 
the radio to highlight the most pressing challenges of the day, 
especially those facing the Black community. His perspective was 
invaluable in an era when conservative talk radio dominated the 
airwaves.
  Throughout his life, Joe proved to be a powerful force for change 
both on and off the air, always asking his famous question. `What are 
you going to do about it?&#x27; He posed that question not only to others 
but to himself. In 2001, he was arrested for protesting human rights 
abuses in Sudan. Breaking records with a 52-hour long broadcast in 
2015, Joe raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the new 
Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. He 
went on a 73-day hunger strike in 2021 to protest Republicans&#x27; 
legislative blockade of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act.
  I saw his passionate advocacy firsthand when we worked together on 
the historic Emmett Till Antilynching Act. Joe and I, along with many 
others, were frustrated that America still lacked a law that made 
lynching a federal crime more than a century after the idea was first 
proposed. During the 116th Congress, we worked with Rep. Bobby Rush and 
then-Representative Karen Bass to rectify that failure. After 
Republicans blocked the bill&#x27;s passage in 2020, we renewed our push in 
the 117th Congress. At long last, President Biden signed the Emmett 
Till Antilynching Act into law on March 29, 2022. It wouldn&#x27;t have been 
possible without Joe Madison. Joe&#x27;s work on the bill and on a variety 
of other causes over the years drew the admiration of millions. 
Listeners were excited to tune in every day and guests were eager to 
come on Joe&#x27;s show because they knew the commentary and conversation 
would be just as meaningful as his principled advocacy.
  Whether discussing the opportunities that the new FBI consolidated 
headquarters will create for Greenbelt, Democrats&#x27; efforts to address 
inflation, or my longstanding work to protect voting rights, I had the 
pleasure of coming on Joe&#x27;s show many times over the years to talk 
about critical issues in Maryland&#x27;s Fifth District and beyond. Many 
other leaders sought out these meaningful conversations with Joe, from 
former President Barack Obama to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi. He 
inspired each of his guests--and each of his listeners--to reflect more 
deeply on their principles, their politics, and their perspectives.
  Mr. Speaker, Joe&#x27;s voice was defined not by its earthy baritone but 
by its moral clarity and commitment to truth. Like so many others 
across the country and around the world, I will miss hearing it crackle 
through the radio in the morning. Joe may be gone, but the question he 
posed to his listeners remains: `What are you going to do about it?&#x27; 
Although he can no longer ask us that question, we can still answer.
  Mr. Speaker, I offer my prayers to Joe&#x27;s incredible wife of 47 years, 
Sherry; his three daughters, Monesha Madison Lever, Shawna Collins and 
Michelle Borleske; his son, Jason Madison; his four half-siblings; his 
five grandchildren; and his great-granddaughter. I ask that all my 
colleagues join me in wishing them strength and in mourning Joe 
Madison--a titan of the airwaves. May God bless and keep Joe Madison.

      RECOGNIZING HURON VALLEY PACE&#x27;S 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I use today to recognize Huron Valley PACE 
on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of their founding. Their 
contributions over the past ten years to improving the lives of the 
elderly in Washtenaw County are worthy of commendation.
  Huron Valley PACE was founded in 2014 in Ypsilanti, Michigan to 
provide medical and supportive services for the elderly in the greater 
Washtenaw County area. Their all-inclusive care, which is covered by 
Medicare and Medicaid, provides coverage for primary and specialty 
care, prescription drugs, medical transportation, hospital visits, 
dental care, medical equipment, home care, and physical, occupational, 
and speech therapy. Their extensive range of services have notably 
helped support hundreds of low-income adults with housing,

[[Page E219]]

living, and medical expenses, and their dedication to serving their 
community is admirable.
  Over the past decade, Huron Valley PACE has been a proactive member 
of the local community, setting up events such as Super Bowl watch 
parties, heart disease awareness drives, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
community service projects in partnership with other local 
organizations. In addition to caring for the elderly in Washtenaw 
County, Huron Valley PACE also works to instill a commitment to public 
service in local high school and university students by offering hands-
on volunteer opportunities for students. Volunteers distribute hot 
meals to underserved communities, lead food drives, and raise awareness 
about senior care.
  Part of Huron Valley PACE&#x27;s proactive approach to providing 
exceptional care for the elderly includes advocating for expanding 
comprehensive senior care services like the PACE Expanded Act. At the 
state level, Huron Valley PACE works with the Michigan State 
Legislature to reduce the cost of medical care and to find innovative 
ways to help elderly people remain living in their homes. This advocacy 
is yet another example of how Huron Valley PACE continues to 
demonstrate their commitment to providing and advocating for quality 
and affordable elderly care.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
founding of Huron Valley PACE on their 10th anniversary. They have had 
a tremendous impact on the Washtenaw County area and continue to find 
exciting ways to continue improving their services to their community, 
and I cannot wait to see what they accomplish over the next decade.

                     RECOGNIZING MS. ADEL SCHNEIDER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, March 6, 2024

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a young 
Wisconsinite I have had the pleasure of meeting with throughout my time 
in Congress, Ms. Adel Schneider.
  At nine months old, Adel was diagnosed with a severe dairy allergy. 
This diagnosis transformed the Schneider family&#x27;s daily life. 
Oftentimes, Adel had to be careful with cake at birthday celebrations 
or at holiday events, where a main focus is food. While this could have 
been isolating, Adel was inspired by her allergy; she began raising 
awareness in her hometown of Appleton.
  Adel and her mother, Kara, are seen on local television, sporting 
events and at schools in Northeast Wisconsin, fundraising and informing 
others about food allergies. Adel has been successful in her 
fundraising efforts, raising over $50,000 for FARE, a non-profit that 
promotes food allergy awareness and research. In 2018, Adel was the 
recipient of the FARE Teen Achievement Award following her involvement 
in the annual Milwaukee Food Allergy Heroes Walk. In 2020, the 
Schneider family donated allergy-friendly food to Paul&#x27;s Pantry in 
Green Bay after receiving a grant from FARE. She has partnered with 
Appleton&#x27;s Minor League Baseball team, the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, 
to share information with the community on food-allergies. She is a Red 
Sneakers for Oakley Ambassador, where she creates social media content 
centered on food allergy awareness. Most recently, Adel ran her annual 
Teal Halloween Skate, which is a community Halloween event that 
provides allergy-safe treats.
  As Adel became more vocal in the community, her advocacy spread to 
Congress. I first met Adel in 2020 to discuss the FASTER Act, which 
requires food companies to include sesame as an allergen on their 
labels. After successfully passing this legislation, I have continued 
to meet with Adel to discuss future legislation on food allergies. Most 
recently, Adel and I discussed the ADINA Act, a bill I introduced in 
2023. This legislation would require pharmaceutical companies to be 
more transparent about their allergy risks on drug labels. I always 
look forward to meeting with Adel and hearing about her community 
events in Northeast Wisconsin. I value her perspective and commend the 
work she is doing on food-allergy awareness.

[[Page E220]]

  Adel has inspired many, including myself, with her advocacy for 
individuals with food allergies. I take comfort in knowing there are 
young citizens stepping up in their communities. Adel has a long list 
of accomplishments, and I look forward to watching her accomplish even 
more.
