                 CELEBRATING ELGIN VINES&#x27; 90TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 5, 2025

  Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of my 
constituent, Elgin Vines, who turned 90 years old on May 19, 2025. 
Through the segregation of the Jim Crow South, on stages big and small 
across the world, Mr Vines&#x27; career as a bassist continues to be a 
bridge in the jazz community--connecting worlds, hearts, and histories.
  Born on May 19, 1935, in Suffolk, Virginia, at a time when the odds 
were not in his favor, Mr. Vines charted a course that was uniquely his 
own. As a student at Norfolk State University with a Biology/Medical 
Technology major, Mr. Vines paid his tuition and fees with gigs along 
the Virginia Beach ``strip,&#x27;&#x27; before graduating as an ASCP-certified 
medical technologist. During that time, he was also a member of the 
house trio on the daily ``Morty Nevins Television Show&#x27;&#x27; for three 
years. In his eight-year stint as a bassist for the touring group ``The 
New Direction,&#x27;&#x27; Mr. Vines was a guest on national programs like The 
Tonight Show. He has also played alongside giants like Frank Sinatra 
Sr. and Jr., the Mills Brothers, and toured on the same circuits as 
Ella Fitzgerald and Elvis Presley. What Mr. Vines remembers most is not 
the glitz of the spotlight, but the dignity of people who, like him, 
believed music could tear down walls.
  Mr. Vines moved to West Michigan in 1972, where he married his wife 
of nearly 52 years, Jackie, and played bass for the Bennie Carew Trio--
quickly becoming an indispensable member of our local music community. 
Mr. Vines has been a member of the Grand Rapids Symphony Orchestra Jazz 
Ensemble, played for the Grand Rapids Public Museum and the Gerald R. 
Ford Presidential Museum, and worked in many local trios. He has gifted 
his love of jazz to both neighbors and Hollyhock Lane parade-goers for 
decades. Mr. Vines is more than a bassist. He is a living example of 
compassion, resilience, and strength.
  Mr. Speaker, once more, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending 
Mr. Elgin Vines for his lifelong impact. His rhythm has carried 
generations, and his soulful steadiness has graced every room he&#x27;s 
walked into. I wish him another happy, healthy, and fulfilling year 
ahead.

  HONORING 63 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE BY CITY OF TAMPA EMPLOYEE MARY 
                                 BRYAN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KATHY CASTOR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 5, 2025

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career 
and contributions of Mary Bryan, a spirited and dedicated public 
servant whose love of the City of Tampa knows no bounds. Mary served 
her Tampa neighbors for over 63 years, which began after her high 
school graduation in 1962. She holds the record for the longest-serving 
employee of the City of Tampa. I congratulate Mary on an incredible 
career and thank her for her unwavering dedication to the Tampa Bay 
Community.
  Mary began her career in the early redevelopment office of Urban 
Renewal in 1962 and remained there until 1972. She assisted in the 
first wave of City of Tampa renewal and redevelopment programs. She 
continued her work in the housing, code enforcement and zoning 
department before beginning in the city attorney&#x27;s office. Mary was the 
principal and trusted grants writer responsible for awards totaling in 
the tens of millions of dollars to the city annually.
  Mary served under 11 mayors and 59 city council members, and she has 
helped Tampa Bay grow into the thriving community it is today. Mary 
worked in the legal department as City Attorney James Palermo&#x27;s 
Assistant until 2011. She then returned as the legislative aide to City 
Council member Charlie Miranda, where she will finish out her tenure as 
a City of Tampa employee.
  Serving as an aide to Charlie Miranda, Mary garnered a reputation 
that no constituent request was out of reach. From potholes to a noisy 
neighbor, she ensured that everyone&#x27;s requests were accounted for. Mary 
is known for her vast institutional knowledge, willingness to help and 
tenacity. She was known for calling up an administrator and speaking 
plainly, cutting through red tape to make sure the job at hand got done 
in a timely manner.
  In 2023, Mayor Castor awarded Mary the Josephine Howard Stafford 
Memorial Award, an award given to a woman employed by the City of Tampa 
who has demonstrated outstanding commitment to her position and 
community. Mayor Castor has commented that, ``There&#x27;s rarely a night I 
go home and it&#x27;s not dark outside, and if there is another car in the 
lot, it&#x27;s Mary&#x27;s.&#x27;&#x27;
  For over the past twenty years, Mary has also set up the holiday 
decorations at Old City Hall. Even through her hard work, she always 
made time to spread cheer.
  Mary&#x27;s colleagues say she is not only an effective fighter, but her 
dedication reflects deep care for her neighbors. Occasionally when 
residents have appeared before the city council, some have felt 
intimidated by a list of suits and procedural rules. She has, at times, 
held people&#x27;s hands to help them navigate city-level bureaucracy. 
Stephen Michelins, a city planner in the 1970&#x27;s, said, ``When people 
would get stuck, she&#x27;ll go out in the audience and grab them and say, 
`Come here.&#x27; She&#x27;s been the friend of thousands.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my neighbors in Tampa Bay and the citizens 
of Florida, I am proud to honor Mary Bryan for her service to the City 
of Tampa. Mary dedicated her life ensuring that everyone had a place in 
Tampa Bay. It is hard-working and selfless public servants like Mary 
that make Tampa the welcoming and generous place it is today. Our 
community is eternally grateful for Mary&#x27;s immense contributions.

           HONORING JULIE TENSEN AS SHE STEPS INTO RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON

                                of idaho

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 5, 2025

  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my longtime 
employee, Julie Tensen.
  I have often said that a really good staff makes a decent Member of 
Congress look great--and I have the best staff. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to 
have outstanding individuals like Julie by my side.
  Julie started working for me early in my career. She&#x27;s had many roles 
since the beginning, including Education Outreach Coordinator, where 
she teamed up with the Lee Pesky Learning Center to create a program 
aimed at helping new mothers read to their babies and create healthy 
habits that we know are so important in today&#x27;s tech world. I can 
honestly say that Julie was ahead of her time and got me involved in 
this important initiative back in 2002.
  A Congressman&#x27;s schedule is crazy at best. You have your Washington 
schedule full of hearings, votes, and thousands of meetings, and then 
you have the district schedule that consists of tours, site visits, 
office meetings, and so much more. Meeting with your constituents in 
their environment and the logistics that go with it are even more 
complicated. I could always count on Julie to dot every `i&#x27; and cross 
every `t&#x27;.
  People may also be unaware that every member of Congress receives an 
MRA, or a Member&#x27;s Representational Allowance. This is your budget for 
running all of your offices. This includes staff salaries, rent, office 
supplies, computer equipment, subscriptions, travel expenses, and all 
other items that are purchased to run a congressional office. Julie was 
my Budget Director, overseeing the entire budget--a huge responsibility 
that she handled for me. Like everything that Julie did, she did well, 
and I never had to worry about a thing.
  From helping tens of thousands of Idahoans navigate complex federal 
issues to managing my entire state schedule, to personally attending 
meetings and events representing me, Julie has been far more than an 
asset--she has been family.
  As she enters retirement, Julie will enjoy some well-deserved time 
with her husband, and their children, Kris and Cole Anderson, Brad 
Tensen, Hannah Purdy, and their grandchildren, Max, Jacq, and Maggie.
  I will miss Julie, the rest of my staff will miss Julie, and so will 
the Idahoans that she so faithfully served for the last two decades.
  Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincere gratitude to Julie&#x27;s husband, John, 
for sharing his amazing wife with Team Simpson for all these years. And 
I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking and honoring Julie Tensen 
for her decades of outstanding public service to the people of Idaho 
and this great Nation.

          HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DIANE LUND-MUZIKANT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MAXINE DEXTER

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 5, 2025

  Ms. DEXTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Diane Lund-Muzikant--a fearless journalist, a tenacious truth-teller, 
and the founder of The Lund Report, Oregon&#x27;s pioneering nonprofit 
dedicated to health care reporting. Diane passed away on Saturday, July 
26, 2025, at the age of 86, leaving behind an indelible mark on 
Oregon&#x27;s media and public health landscape.
  Before I was elected to serve in this body, I spent more than two 
decades as a physician. I saw firsthand how opaque, inequitable, and 
profit-driven our health care system can be, and I also saw the vital 
role of journalists who were willing to peel back the curtain. Diane 
was one of those few. She understood that behind every headline about 
health care policy are real people--patients, families, and 
communities--impacted by decisions made in boardrooms and back rooms. 
She made it her mission to hold those in power accountable.
  Diane began her reporting career covering local government and 
community issues before turning her focus to health care in the 1980&#x27;s. 
Her work with the Medical Society of Metropolitan Portland helped 
illuminate the growing dysfunction in our health care system, a story 
too often ignored or misunderstood by the broader media.
  She went on to found the Oregon Health Forum to convene critical 
dialogue around health policy, and then, at age 70, launched The Lund 
Report, a nonprofit news outlet that quickly became the gold standard 
for health care journalism in Oregon and across the Pacific Northwest. 
Relentless in her pursuit of truth, Diane asked hard questions, chased 
hard facts, and never shied away from hard truths. She built a legacy 
that will long outlive her.
  Diane Lund-Muzikant embodied the best of what journalism can be: 
independent, courageous, and grounded in service to the public good. 
Her work strengthened Oregon&#x27;s health care system and made our 
communities more informed, more compassionate, and more just.
  As we continue to witness the erosion of local news and independent 
media, Diane&#x27;s example reminds us why supporting journalists--and 
especially those committed to covering complex systems like health 
care--is essential to our democracy.
  We owe her our gratitude. May her memory be a blessing, and may her 
legacy continue to inspire the next generation of truth-tellers.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 5, 2025

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, on the 14th day of October 1959, a meeting was 
held far from Earth, and it was said, ``It&#x27;s time for a warrior to be 
born on Earth.&#x27;&#x27; This was the birth of Ronald W. Harvey, also known as 
Ronnie. He was born and grew up in Harvey, Illinois, where he attended 
Thornton High School and studied at the Metropolitan State University 
of Denver. He enjoyed baseball during his high school years. Later, 
Ronnie married the love of his life, a dedicated community leader, Mrs. 
Roxie Harvey.
  Ronnie worked for the U.S. Postal Service for over 30 years and 
retired. During his tenure at the post office, he played in the post 
office basketball league and had a fierce 3-point shot. He and his 
friend, Speech, secretly started a prayer circle named the Brothers of 
the Circle. The group was so effective and grew so large that they had 
to move the meeting to a bowling alley.
  Post retirement, Ronnie worked as a truck driver for Lucky Duck 
Express and Dynasty Trucking. He was later ordained and served as 
Pastor of the Real Love Christian Center in Illinois. He served as a 
mentor and went on several mission trips to help improve the lives of 
others. He rendered his service and passion by feeding the homeless and 
listening to and encouraging others in Jesus Christ.
  Whether it was in Illinois, Honduras, or Florida, Ronnie&#x27;s impact 
will continue to be felt as his legacy will live on through his beloved 
wife, Roxie, and his seven children.

  Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr Speaker, I rise today to honor Deputy Elijah 
Ming, who gave his life to serving his community.
  Deputy Ming began serving with the Wyandotte County Sheriff&#x27;s Office 
on October 13, 2016. In his nine years with the Office, he worked in 
the Detention Center for six years, spent two years on Patrol, and 
spent one year in Court Transport. He was truly everything good you 
would want in both a law enforcement officer and in a friend. He was 
always willing to step in for voluntary overtime and to lend a helping 
hand. Deputy Ming&#x27;s work with the department ensured the safety and 
wellbeing of Wyandotte County residents. Our community mourns the loss 
of Deputy Ming and will miss the bright, positive attitude he brought 
to the Office. He was a true patriot and a shining example of courage 
and dedication.

                        Tuesday, August 5, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Blue Envelope Act of 
2025. This bill would make blue envelope programs, which improve 
interactions between police officers and drivers with difficulty 
communicating through speech during a traffic stop, eligible for 
federal transportation safety funding. The American Association of 
People with Disabilities has endorsed this bill.
  Blue envelope programs allow drivers, upon request, to receive a blue 
envelope that explains on the front that the driver has difficulty 
communicating through speech and that holds the documents a police 
officer might request during a traffic stop. These programs exist in 
many jurisdictions across the country, including statewide in 
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Arizona and 
Vermont.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Deal First 
Aid Squad as they celebrate their 75th Anniversary this year.
  In 1950, residents of the Borough of Deal, New Jersey founded the 
Deal First Aid Squad to provide emergency medical services day

[[Page E752]]

and night. For 75 years, this organization has operated uninterrupted, 
completely volunteer-based, and performed a range of reliable services 
from routine transport to emergency response. With exemplary civic 
dedication, members have fostered an immeasurable dependability that 
stands out as a pillar to the Deal community and beyond. I commend the 
Deal First Aid Squad for their commitment to support residents during 
times of need, including life-saving interventions and storm-related 
emergencies. As the country braces with more extreme weather, like 
severe flooding and heat, it is rewarding to know that safety is the 
priority to the Deal First Aid Squad
  Today, the community outreach by the Deal First Aid Squad is truly 
inspiring. The organization reached hundreds of residents with classes 
to CPR, AED, and First Aid training. Over the past few decades, they 
have answered tens of thousands of calls, while participating in 
several town parades, health fairs, and local school events. The strong 
community connection is reflected in the generations of families that 
have joined the Deal First Aid Squad. Notably, they have served in key 
mutual aid roles and frequent interagency cooperation across Monmouth 
County.
  Mr Speaker, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in marking 
the 75th Anniversary of the Deal First Aid Squad and celebrating its 
rich impact on the Borough of Deal and greater Monmouth County.
