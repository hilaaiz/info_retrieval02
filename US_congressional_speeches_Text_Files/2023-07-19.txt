                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and offer my 
thanks to Carlos Graupera, of Lancaster, for his 50 years of service 
and leadership. Mr. Graupera retired this year as the Chief Executive 
Officer of the Spanish American Civic Association (SACA), an 
organization he founded in 1973 to serve Lancaster&#x27;s growing Latino 
community.
  In 1961, Mr. Graupera emigrated to the United States with his family 
from Cuba. He would attend Saint Joseph&#x27;s College and work in community 
development, before founding SACA and beginning his tenure as the 
organization&#x27;s first CEO.
  In 50 years, SACA has grown substantially to support and improve the 
lives of Lancaster County residents. SACA operates a senior center, 
behavior and health services, a community radio station called Radio 
Centro, supports economic development through SACA Development, and 
operates a network of workforce development training programs called 
Tec Centro. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to see the good work that they do 
first-hand.
  Mr. Graupera is now assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer of 
the Tec Centro Workforce Network, which operates workforce development 
programs in Lancaster, York, Lebanon, and Reading.
  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Graupera&#x27;s 50 years of service as CEO of SACA have 
made a deep and lasting impact on the community and in countless lives 
of those who have benefited from good works of SACA.
  As he steps into a new role, we wish him continued success and thank 
him for his life of leadership and service to our community.

HONORING MATTHEW LIPTRAP ON WINNING THE EVELYNE VILLINES NATIONAL AWARD

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LAMBORN

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend an exceptional 
individual who exemplifies unwavering dedication to supporting our 
servicemen and servicewomen: Matthew Liptrap. Recently bestowed with 
the prestigious 2023 Evelyne Villines Award, Matthew&#x27;s achievements are 
truly deserving of recognition.
  Evelyne Villines, a champion for meaningful employment opportunities 
for individuals with disabilities, left an indelible mark through her 
influential work. From advising politicians to advocating both 
nationally and globally, she played a crucial role in shaping 
initiatives like the Americans with Disabilities Act, and her legacy 
lives on through this award. It honors individuals who have not only 
attained employment despite significant disabilities but have also 
excelled in management roles within AbilityOne contracts. Considering 
Matthew&#x27;s accomplishments, I firmly believe he is a perfect recipient 
of this esteemed award.
  Matthew&#x27;s journey began with over 10 years of dedicated service in 
the U.S. Army as an infantryman. Unfortunately, combat injuries cut 
short his military career. Nevertheless, he found a new purpose at 
Professional Contract Services Incorporated (PCSI), an organization 
committed to supporting both individuals with disabilities as well as 
veterans. At Schriever Space Force Base, working on an AbilityOne 
Contract, Matthew dedicated himself to serving his brothers and sisters 
in arms once again. Starting as a ground&#x27;s maintenance worker and 
general clerk, Matthew&#x27;s determination, willingness to learn, and 
leadership qualities caught the attention of PCSI, propelling him to 
the role of Quality Control Manager. In this capacity, he successfully 
revamped the Quality and Training programs, resulting in decreased 
injuries, enhanced safety measures, and flawless internal audit 
reports. Matthew&#x27;s exceptional achievements have set him apart from his 
peers, serving as an inspiration to both employees and colleagues.
  I take great pride in acknowledging Matthew&#x27;s unwavering commitment 
to service, both within and beyond his military career. It brings me 
great satisfaction to witness his national recognition from 
SourceAmerica for his outstanding contributions at Schriever through 
the AbilityOne Program. His story is a testament to the transformative 
power of dedication and perseverance, and I am confident that his 
accomplishments will continue to inspire others to follow in his 
footsteps. Matthew Liptrap embodies the caliber of hardworking and 
talented individuals that make our great nation, and my home state of 
Colorado, a better place.

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Michael 
Robbins for his bravery and service as a U.S. merchant mariner during 
World War II. Serving from July of 1943 to May of 1946, Mr. Robbins 
sailed with the U.S. Merchant Marine aboard the SS Olney, the SS 
Pendleton, the SS O. Henry, and the SS Hoke Smith.
  During World War II, nearly 250,000 civilian merchant mariners were 
activated to serve as part of the U.S. military and to delivered troops 
and supplies by ship to foreign countries engulfed in the war. They 
faced treacherous conditions along their routes. Between 1939 and 1945, 
9,521 U.S. merchant mariners gave their lives--a higher proportion than 
those killed than in any military branch--in defense of our nation. 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt called their mission the most difficult 
and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken.
  Hailing from Atlantic City, New Jersey, Mr. Robbins enlisted in the 
U.S. Merchant Marine at only 15 years old. He began his wartime efforts 
as an ordinary seaman, chipping away rust and old paint from the ship.
  While aboard SS O. Henry and transporting supplies in the 
Mediterranean Sea, his convoy was attacked by air. Mr. Robbins, still a 
teenager, acted to defend his ship by delivering 20mm ammunition to the 
ship&#x27;s crew. Mr. Robbins would go on to serve in the Atlantic, 
Mediterranean, and Pacific theaters.
  Mr. Robbins received several decorations during his service, 
including 3 War Zone medals awarded to Merchant Marines for their 
service in the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean and Middle 
East. He also received the World War II Victory Medal for honorable 
service while on active duty, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, the 
Combat Bar, the Honorable Service Button, a Presidential Testimonial 
Letter, and the Battlin&#x27; Pete Patch.
  Mr. Robbins and the U.S. merchant mariners of World War II who played 
crucial roles in the country&#x27;s war effort were awarded the 
Congressional Gold Medal in 2020, the highest honor Congress can bestow 
on civilians. It was an honor to present the medal to Mr, Robbins then, 
and it is an honor to recognize him here again today.
  Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring and celebrating the dedicated 
service of Mr. Michael Robbins for his valor and service in defending 
our country. May his legacy continue to inspire us for generations to 
come.

        HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MR. ARMAND M. MARTINELLI

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to the late Armand 
M. Martinelli, a beloved teacher, veteran, husband, father, 
grandfather, great-grandfather and community leader from Northeastern 
Pennsylvania who has left an indelible mark on our community through 
his profound dedication to education and service.
  Armand Martinelli, a devout Roman Catholic born in Olyphant, PA, 
embodied the values of faith, integrity, and selflessness throughout 
his 92 years of life. From his humble beginnings at Lafayette School in 
Scranton and Mother Cabrini School to becoming a member of the first 4-
year graduating class at Scranton Preparatory School, Armand&#x27;s early 
education laid the foundation for a lifetime of intellectual pursuit 
and service to others.
  Armand Martinelli served his country valiantly during the Korean War. 
His military journey took him from the 101st Airborne in Breckinridge, 
Kentucky, to the U.S. Counter Intelligence School at Fort Holabird in 
Baltimore, Maryland. He displayed unwavering commitment and courage as 
a special agent with the 704th CIC in Teague and the 308th CIC in 
Pusan, earning the respect and gratitude of his fellow soldiers.
  Upon returning to civilian life, Armand embraced a diverse array of 
occupations before discovering his true calling as an educator. For 
over 5 decades, he worked as a self-employed painter, an insurance 
agent, and a teacher at West Scranton High School. It was within the 
walls of West Scranton High School that Armand would leave an enduring 
legacy as an influential and dedicated educator.
  For 30 years, Armand taught social studies, Latin, and journalism, 
molding the minds of countless students who passed through his 
classrooms. His commitment extended beyond the subject matter; he 
served as an athletic director for 24 years and provided guidance to 
numerous clubs and organizations, including the yearbook, school 
newspaper, and Latin club, among others. His passion for education and 
genuine care for his students earned him the love and admiration of 
those he taught, and many kept in touch with him long after graduation.
  Outside the classroom, Armand&#x27;s dedication to public service was 
equally commendable. He actively sought to improve our community, 
serving as a member of the Scranton School Board where be championed 
education initiatives. He also played an integral role in the formation 
of the Scranton Federation of Teachers.
  Devoted to serving his West Scranton community and proud of his 
Italian heritage, Armand enjoyed spending time at the Victor Alfieri 
Club where he was an original member of the Cetaiolos bocce team as 
well as attending weekly get together with friends at the Villa Maria 
Restaurant.
  Above all else, Armand loved his family. He took great pride in his 
roles as a husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He 
always looked forward to weekly Sunday dinners, where he treated his 
family to his homemade sauce and meatballs, which he faithfully made 
right up to the last 2 weeks of his life.
  After retiring from his distinguished teaching career, Armand 
continued to serve our community, working as a Tipstaff for Judge James 
J. Walsh, and serving on numerous local executive boards, including the 
Scranton Redevelopment Authority, the Scranton Housing Authority, and 
the Lackawanna Drug and Alcohol Treatment Service. Armand&#x27;s commitment 
to making a positive impact on the lives of others knew no bounds.
  As we mourn the loss of a true pillar of our community, let us also 
celebrate the profound impact Armand Martinelli had on the lives of 
countless individuals. Through his selfless dedication to education, 
service, and family, he leaves behind a legacy that will continue to 
inspire future generations. May the memory of Armand M. Martinelli 
serve as a beacon of hope and goodness in our community, and may we be 
reminded of the power of a single individual to positively influence 
the lives of others.

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Christopher Raker who 
passed away at the age of 78 on July 5, 2023. Christopher was a 
longtime resident of Mill Valley and beloved member of the community.
  Born in San Francisco to John and Elda Jane Raker, Christopher, 
nicknamed Chris, lived in the Palace Hotel where his grandfather was a 
general manager. The family later moved to Concord, Massachusetts and 
Chris enrolled at Columbia University before joining the Navy and 
serving as a lieutenant during the Vietnam War. After his military 
service Chris earned a master&#x27;s degrees in English Literature from the 
University of Virginia, and a master&#x27;s degree in architecture from 
Harvard University. He settled in Mill Valley, California in 1975.
  In 1989, Chris opened Raker Architects in Mill Valley. The firm 
contributed to key modernizations in Southern Marin, including the 
Corinthian Yacht Club, Mill Valley Lumber Yard, and most notably, Mill 
Valley Miller Avenue Precise Plan, which resulted in the development of 
a pedestrian-friendly reconfiguration

[[Page E696]]

of the prominent and highly trafficked Miller Avenue. Beyond his 
architectural profession, Chris made notable contributions to the town 
as a Planning Commissioner. After 2 years, he served on the Mill Valley 
City Council from 1996 to 2007, including as its mayor.
  Chris also served as president of the American Institute of 
Architects San Francisco chapter and board president of the Corinthian 
Yacht Club. In his free time, he was active in the performing arts and 
enjoyed skiing, swimming, and time spent as a soccer coach.
  Chris was known by his colleagues on the Planning Commission and City 
Council for his direct and open-minded approach to difficult issues and 
great sense of humor. He was a respected mentor to many. He is survived 
by his daughter Bianca Raker, wife Donna Raker, brother Edmond Raker, 
and 3 nephews.
  Mr. Speaker, Christopher Raker was a dedicated public servant and 
active community member who was committed to improving the quality of 
life for Mill Valley residents. I respectfully ask that my colleagues 
join me in extending condolences to Chris&#x27;s family and friends and in 
expressing my appreciation for his decades of good work.

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Hempfield 
Township of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania on the 250th anniversary 
of its founding.
  Since 1773, Hempfield Township has grown into 1 of the largest 
municipalities in Pennsylvania. Currently, it is home to over 40,000 
people and is the largest municipality in Westmoreland County.
  While Hempfield Township is an important hub for business and 
industry, the township never forgot its rich agricultural heritage. 
Hailing from southeastern Pennsylvania, its early settlers were largely 
of German descent and worked to refine grain. As people moved to the 
area, Hempfield grew and is now home to several manufacturing 
facilities, institutes of higher education, and recreational businesses 
that are important to southwestern Pennsylvania&#x27;s economy. Above all, 
the township&#x27;s people exemplify the values of good citizenship and 
devotion to their community.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 14th 
Congressional District, I congratulate Hempfield Township on their 
250th anniversary and look forward to building on this storied history 
over the next 250 years.

    RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND BRAVERY OF THE DEPEW FIRE DEPARTMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join in the celebration 
of Depew Founders&#x27; Day by recognizing the Depew Fire Department and the 
many volunteer firefighters who keep this community safe. It takes 
bravery, courage, and skill to run toward a fire while others are 
moving to safety. It is because of these brave men and women that Depew 
families can sleep at night assured that a strong, capable, and well-
trained force is at the ready to help in their time of need.
  Since 1894, the volunteer corps of the Depew Fire Department has 
grown to become the largest volunteer fire department in Erie County 
and 1 of the largest in New York State, with over 115 active members 
serving 5 Hose Companies and 1 Hook and Ladder Company spread across 
the village:
  Hose Company No. 1
  Aetna Hose Company
  Cayuga Hose Company No. 3
  Central Hose Company No. 4
  West End Hose Company No. 6
  Hook and Ladder Company No. 1
  This is a close-knit community with deep ties to Depew, and with 
generations of firefighters stretching back over a century of service. 
I thank Chief John Gauthier, for his leadership, and to the many 
generations of Depew Fire Department volunteers present and represented 
at the 2023 Depew Founders Day Celebration. Their service and sacrifice 
are greatly appreciated, and I wish them all safety and success as they 
continue to serve this great community.
  I am honored to join in the celebration of Depew Founders&#x27; Day, and 
to recognize the dedication and courage of the Depew Fire Department 
here from the Halls of Congress.

                          ____________________

           SALUTING MS. EDNA PEMBERTON, A TRUE LIVING LEGEND

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JASMINE CROCKETT

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 19, 2023

  Ms. CROCKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very special 
constituent, Ms. Edna Pemberton. Ms. Pemberton is a well-respected 
community leader whose tireless efforts have led to creating a better 
and safer way of life for those around her. As a servant leader, Ms. 
Pemberton has been at the forefront of several initiatives such as, the 
City of Dallas&#x27; Teen Curfew Ordinance and the Cielo Ranch Apartment 
Crime Prevention Outreach program.
  These programs are just a small part of the expansive work that Ms. 
Pemberton has produced in the Dallas community. Ms. Pemberton&#x27;s faith 
in the power of community service has led her to work relentlessly 
across the city of Dallas to reach communities in need and to never 
back down from doing what&#x27;s right. She&#x27;s won numerous awards from 
various organizations recognizing her community service--all of which 
is a testament to her commitment to improving the lives of our 
neighbors across Dallas and abroad. In addition to her efforts around 
community service, Ms. Pemberton has another special gift which 
includes seeking out the issues that are most pressing our communities 
and putting action behind them. From organizing food drives to 
moderating conversations between members of the community and local 
police, she always puts herself at the heart of several impactful 
issues. In an environment where social justice is needed now more than 
ever, acknowledging the impact that relationships between local 
community members and law enforcement have, Ms. Pemberton eased 
tensions by creating a foundation of communication between the groups. 
Equipped with the knowledge, patience and compassion of her community, 
Ms. Edna Pemberton has continued to enrich the lives of others.
  She is an outstanding example of the underappreciated heroes that we 
have all across our City, State, and Country. I am confident that 
because of her impact and service that our communities are a better 
place.
