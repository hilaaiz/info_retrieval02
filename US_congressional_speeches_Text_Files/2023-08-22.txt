                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I wish to clarify that when I join a 
Congressional Caucus, it does not necessarily mean that I agree with 
every position of the Caucus. At a minimum, my membership indicates 
that I seek to learn more about related issues and legislative agendas, 
and I look forward to a robust dialogue on topics under consideration 
by the Caucus. In particular, as mentioned by my colleague, Congressman 
Brad Schneider, in his announcement of the Family Business Caucus, 
membership in that Caucus is open to all Members of Congress seeking to 
learn more about generationally owned family business issues.

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
achievements of Marolyn Overton, the outgoing chair of ``Ladies on the 
Right.&#x27;&#x27;
  Marolyn has always been involved in her community and in politics. 
She was once the President of the Skidaway Island Republican Club, and 
she founded ``Ladies on the Right&#x27;&#x27; in 2020.
  To quote their website, ``when most folks were thinking of retiring, 
Marolyn started the Tea Party movement in Savannah.&#x27;&#x27;
  Since 2020, Ladies on the Right has been a home for conservative 
values in Savannah, Georgia hosting monthly meetings and events about 
the Constitution, the dangers of socialism, and many other topics.
  Ladies on the Right does not just stop at meetings, either. The group 
works to develop solutions to issues facing our country while holding 
politicians accountable.
  Ms. Overton has created an impressive organization, and I commend her 
lifelong commitment to fighting for what is right.

   HONORING ENERGIZER&#x27;S 75th ANNIVERSARY IN ASHEBORO, NORTH CAROLINA

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Energizer Holdings on its 75th anniversary in Asheboro, North Carolina.
  Energizer Holdings is a dynamic and diverse company, operating within 
a wide range of industries and producing an equally wide range of 
products and services. Perhaps best known for Energizer batteries and 
its bunny mascot, this company also runs Rayovac and Eveready, as well 
as prominent auto care brands like Armor All and STP. Energizer&#x27;s 
impact on our Nation&#x27;s economy is tremendous, especially within my 
community in North Carolina.
  Energizer set up shop in Asheboro, North Carolina 75 years ago and 
has since remained an economic staple of the community. Energizer hosts 
hundreds of high paying, local jobs and has brought in millions of 
dollars in economic development into the region. Yet, its impact is 
soon to grow even more. Last spring, Energizer announced a new 
investment of $43 million into its Asheboro-based facilities that will 
add 143 new jobs with wages far above the average for the county. This 
investment will greatly benefit both the city of Asheboro and our 
region at-large.
  Energizer is an esteemed member of our community down in North 
Carolina. Its economic and community impact is astounding, and I am 
pleased that they have called Asheboro home for the last 75 years. I 
look forward to continuing to work with Energizer to see what they will 
accomplish in the future.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Energizer, its 
leaders, and employees on this momentous occasion and to thank them for 
all they do for the community in Randolph County.

                          ____________________

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Colleyville Heritage 
High School&#x27;s Softball Team, who recently won the 2023 UIL Class 5A 
Region I championship. This is the first time in the school history 
that the softball team advanced to the UIL 5A State Tournament. On 
Saturday, May 27, 2023, head coach Allison Conaway led this group of 
talented young women to victory. In the regional finals they beat 
Northwest High School, in the third game of the round with a final 
score of 1 to 0. This team has shown hard work and dedication all 
season and this was a well-deserved victory. I commend this group of 
young women on their UIL Regional championship victory and representing 
the 24th Congressional District of Texas.

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kandi Stewart, 
co-owner of Courage to Conquer Cancer (C2CC). C2CC is devoted to 
promoting research, advocating for patients, and ensuring cost-
efficient resources and systems that will enhance post-surgical 
management outcomes for dialysis, cardiac surgery, cancer, and other 
patients. Kandi is a HEBISD teacher and was diagnosed with breast 
cancer in the fall of 2014. After her diagnosis and treatment, she had 
the inclination to help other cancer patients surmount the financial 
and physical costs. C2CC&#x27;s first initiative was the Breast Cancer 
Recovery Tee Shirt, which is designed with fashion, affordability, and 
functionality in mind. The nonprofit arm of C2CC works to donate free 
recovery kits to mastectomy patients facing financial hardship through 
post-surgical care. Kandi is undergoing cancer treatment for the second 
time after being in remission for years. I want to thank Kandi for 
being a beacon of selflessness and strength within our community.

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lisa Goodwin, a 
shepherd of altruism in North Texas. Lisa routinely goes the extra mile 
to give back to our North Texas community through her charitable 
conduct and volunteerism. Lisa has earned a well-deserved reputation 
for going above and beyond to help others, including using her own 
resources to purchase childcare products for families in need. In her 
free time, Lisa visits nursing home residents and refugees in the Fort 
Worth area to offer them companionship. When Lisa is not volunteering 
her time at church, she can be found helping teens register for 
volunteer hours.
  I want to thank Lisa for being a shining beacon of light in our 
community.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the 
life of Mr. William Friedkin, who passed away on August 7, 2023. Mr. 
Friedkin was a master filmmaker who is best known for directing such 
hit films as The French Connection (1971) and The Exorcist (1973), 
which went on to become highly-acclaimed. Mr. Friedkin was born on 
August 25, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois. His parents, Louis and Rachael 
Friedkin, were Jewish emigrants who fled their dangerous home country 
due to religious persecution. Mr. Friedkin attended public schools in 
Chicago, where he developed a fascination with movies and television. 
He began his career in entertainment and television working with WGN TV 
immediately after graduating high school.
   William moved to Hollywood in 1965 and shortly thereafter began to 
direct hit television programs like The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and his 
first feature film, Good Times, which starred Sonny and Cher. Mr. 
Friedkin released his first acclaimed film in 1971, The French 
Connection, which depicted two NYPD officers who attempt to uncover a 
large smuggling ring. This film was described as one of the best films 
of its time and is widely considered one of the greatest movies of all 
time, having been selected for preservation in the United States 
National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2005.
  Following the success of his previous film, Mr. Friedkin released The 
Exorcist in 1973. The film was based on William Petter Blatty&#x27;s novel 
which depicted the possession of a young girl. It is known today as one 
of Hollywood&#x27;s top-grossing horror movies of all time. At a moment in 
history where horror movies were not considered critically acclaimed, 
The Exorcist elevated audiences&#x27; attitudes towards the entire movie 
genre. Mr. Friedkin rose to be a sought-after director in Hollywood 
after the success of both films. William&#x27;s work has continued to be a 
strong influence on American and international filmmakers and he 
continued to direct into the final year of his life, directing a film 
adaptation of author Herman Wouk&#x27;s The Caine Mutiny.
  Mr. Friedkin is survived by his wife of 32 years, Mrs. Sherry 
Lansing, the chairwoman of Universal Music Group; and two sons, Cedric 
Friedkin, a successful production manager and Jackson Friedkin, an 
accomplished film editor. May his memory be a blessing to all who knew 
him.

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Mr. GOLDMAN of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Parent 
Child Relationship Association (PCR) on the occasion of its 5th 
anniversary. PCR is a volunteer run nonprofit organization that rose to 
the challenge to provide essential services to some of the most 
vulnerable residents of New York&#x27;s Congressional District 10.
  The South Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park and its neighboring 
Dyker Height and Bensonhurst are home to New York&#x27;s fastest growing 
Chinese immigrant community. The influx of the immigrant population 
invigorated local cultural and economic life, and it also brought great 
needs for social services. Nicole Huang established PCR in 2018, after 
having successfully organized local immigrant parents and youths to 
volunteer for community improvement projects and to provide mutual 
assistance.
  In the 5 years since, PCR has expanded rapidly, becoming an essential 
service provider for Chinese-speaking community members that are in 
need of culturally competent services in Sunset Park. Every year, 
hundreds of volunteers contribute countless hours through PCR to 
provide services that benefit many thousands that are in need. In 
addition to promoting civic engagement and providing essential social 
services, PCR also organizes community mental health workshops and 
steadfastly champions mental health awareness for youths, mothers and 
the elderly.
  When the COVID-19 pandemic devastated New York City in 2020, PCR 
stepped up to serve when the community fell into crisis. From 
collecting PPE donation and distributing them to hospitals and senior 
centers, to managing a weekly community food pantry, to assisting the 
victims of multiple devastating fires in Sunset Park who faced threat 
of homelessness in the middle of the pandemic, Nicole Huang and her 
volunteers were always on the frontline serving and uplifting the most 
vulnerable.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the 
ongoing work of PCR for the Chinese immigrant community of Brooklyn. It 
has made a significant contribution in making New York the vibrant city 
of immigrants and diverse cultures that exemplifies the promise of the 
United States and the American Dream.

                                 ______

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of Mr. Walter Raymond Hall.
  Walter Raymond Hall was born in Anniston, Alabama. On April 26, 1933, 
he enlisted in the Civilian Conservation Corps at Fort McClellan, 
Alabama, and was mustered in as a laborer with Company 463, the Forest 
Service crew that built Cheaha State Park, Alabama, including the famed 
Bunker Tower. Hall was honorably discharged from service with the 
Civilian Conservation Corps in June of 1934.
  He began his service as a law enforcement officer in May of 1953, 
when Calhoun County Sheriff A.A. ``Socco&#x27;&#x27; Pate swore Hall in as Deputy 
Sheriff. Tragically, in October of 1962 while transferring a prisoner 
from Calhoun County to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Hall was involved in a car 
accident. Walter Raymond Hall passed away in November of 1962 from 
complications related to injuries sustained during the car accident.
  He was laid to rest at Forestlawn Gardens in Anniston, Alabama. He 
left behind his wife, Aileen, his two children, Jerry and Gail, a 
brother, Charlie, and a sister, Birdie Mae.
  In 2023, Hall&#x27;s name was placed on the National Law Enforcement 
Memorial in Washington, D.C., as well as on the State of Alabama Law 
Enforcement Memorial in Centennial Memorial Park in Anniston.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the life of Mr. Walter 
Raymond Hall and his service to the State of Alabama.

        REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR. ELBRIDGE BRUBAKER

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. HARRIET M. HAGEMAN

                               of wyoming

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Ms. HAGEMAN. Mr. Speaker, respect for one&#x27;s neighbors and service to 
one&#x27;s community are the values that have built this great Nation. 
However, solitary acts of kindness and assistance were not nearly 
enough for Dr. Elbridge Brubaker who throughout his entire career 
consistently made it his goal to improve the quality of someone&#x27;s day. 
Dr. Brubaker was a born and raised Wyomingite who always recognized his 
lifelong dream to become a physician. He would later realize that dream 
after completing his education at the University of Wyoming in 1961 and 
obtaining his medical degree from the University of Tennessee in 1965. 
Upon graduating with his medical degree, he made the decision to serve 
our country in the Army as the Chief Medical Officer in Montgomery, 
Alabama, where he was responsible for performing physicals of potential 
recruits. Following his time in the Army, Dr. Brubaker returned to 
Casper, Wyoming, and opened a family medical practice that he operated 
for over 5 decades. His exceptional ability to provide compassionate 
care was valued by each and every 1 of his patients. However, most 
importantly, he was a loving husband, father, and grandfather who 
valued time with his family and the good Lord above all else. Dr. 
Brubaker&#x27;s kindness and expertise have undoubtedly left a powerful mark 
on the community of Casper and in the hearts of everyone who knew him.

                    TRIBUTE TO STANLEY (STAN) SLOSS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE NEGUSE

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 22, 2023

  Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, this House is well served by the many public 
servants who make up the ranks of congressional staff, and I want to 
acknowledge the passing of one such public servant, Stan Sloss. 
Stanley, or ``Stan&#x27;&#x27; as he was known to all those who worked with and 
knew him, grew up in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, and spent his career 
serving a number of Members of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate who 
represented Colorado and Alaska. He was a legislative director to 
former Representative David Skaggs and former Senator Mark Udall, who 
both, at the time Stan worked for them, represented the Second 
Congressional District of Colorado--a district that I am proud to 
represent.
  Stan dedicated his life to public service having spent 37 years in 
various roles in Congress. When he retired, at age 70, then Senator 
Mark Udall, provided a tribute to Stan in a floor speech, in which he 
captured the essence of what made Stan so respected and admired. Those 
who had the benefit of working with Stan during his time in Congress 
can attest to the sentiments reflected in that tribute.
  As Sen. Mark Udall and Rep. David Skaggs noted in their remarks, Stan 
was adept at drafting legislation and constructing public policies that 
were examples of legal rigor and textual precision to achieve the 
desired objectives of those seeking quality solutions to challenging 
issues. His work has stood the test of time and is a model for all of 
us as we work together to address the needs of our constituents and the 
goals of our nation. But it was his integrity, his willingness to work 
with all sides, his respect of others&#x27; opinions, and his personal 
approach of patience and good humor that he brought to all of his 
endeavors that will be most remembered by those who worked with him and 
valued his expertise and friendship.
  Stan is survived by his sister Ellie Hanlon, as well as other family 
members and everyone fortunate enough to have known and worked with 
him. Stan set the standard for professionalism, decorum, patience, and 
perfected the skill of staffing congressional Members and mentoring 
those who wished to learn what it takes to succeed in Congress and 
crafting enduring and effective public policy.
