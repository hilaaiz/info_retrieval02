         CELEBRATING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF PEKIN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DARIN LaHOOD

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the City of 
Pekin, Illinois, which I&#x27;m proud to represent in Congress, as it 
celebrates its 200th anniversary.
  Pekin&#x27;s history began with Pioneer Jonathan Tharp building a small 
log cabin in 1824 on the high east bank of the Illinois River in what 
would become Pekin, Illinois. The families of Gideon Hawley, William 
Haines, Nathan Cromwell, Dr. John Warner, William Brown, Thomas Snell, 
Isaac Perkins, William Carpenter--among others--joined the Tharps in 
settling and establishing the new community.
  Pekin, fondly referred to by its early inhabitants as the ``Celestial 
City&#x27;&#x27;, embraces the inspiration its founders received by Chinese 
culture and geography in its namesake (Peking, current Beijing), with 
Pekin and modern-day Beijing existing on or about the same latitude.
  Since its earliest days, Pekin&#x27;s proximity to railroads and the 
Illinois River has made it

[[Page E988]]

ideal for agribusiness and manufacturing--providing for its abundant 
growth and early establishment as the largest city and the current 
county seat in the County of Tazewell.
  Abraham Lincoln freed his first slave, Nance Legins-Costley of Pekin, 
in Tazewell County, and Pekin is the birthplace of such prominent 
national figures as U.S. Senate Minority Leader Everett McKinley 
Dirksen; U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense and Advisor to Robert 
McNamara, John T. McNaughton; Journalist Richard Stolley of LIFE 
Magazine, and Astronaut Scott Altman.
  Today, Pekin remains a closely-knit and primarily service-oriented 
community, with dozens of churches, civic and service organizations, 
and nonprofit agencies striving to make a difference in the Pekin 
community and beyond. The founding pioneer settlers of Pekin believed 
strongly that it was imperative to provide their youth with a strong 
education, and the Pekin Public Schools have diligently nurtured the 
children of the Pekin community since its first school opened in 1830.
  Pekin is perhaps best known today for its annual Marigold Festival 
that draws visitors from all over the state and the nation, gathering 
primarily in its iconic Mineral Springs Park. Community members have 
successfully led an 18-month endeavor to raise over $1.2M in private 
funds and to build a performing arts venue in Mineral Springs as a 
major Bicentennial gift to the City, its residents, and many future 
generations.
  Pekin continues to make exceptional efforts to preserve and 
understand its past while embracing its future, led by organizations 
such as the Pekin Public Library and the Tazewell County Genealogical 
and Historical Society: Its year-long 2024 Bicentennial celebration has 
been among the highest of such achievements.
  Today, we celebrate the City of Pekin and its residents for their 
passion and dedication to their community. I extend my sincere 
congratulations to the City of Pekin, Illinois for a successful 200 
years, and I wish them even more success in the years to come.

                          ____________________

                       COMMENDING ROBERT SUNSHINE

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Robert Sunshine on his retirement after 48 years of stellar service to 
the Congressional Budget Office, the Congress, and the country. I&#x27;d 
like to take a few minutes to honor this truly exceptional public 
servant.
  Bob&#x27;s tenure at CBO has been extraordinary, not just for its 
longevity, but for the outstanding work he has produced and the people 
he has so deeply affected. Throughout his distinguished career, he has 
served as a mentor to countless members of the CBO staff (and to CBO&#x27;s 
directors) who have valued his wisdom, work ethic, and experienced 
perspective. Bob truly exemplifies the values of dedication and 
leadership--of upholding CBO&#x27;s mandate to be objective, impartial, and 
nonpartisan.
  Before coming to CBO, Bob was a senior associate at a transportation 
consulting firm. He joined CBO in 1976 when the agency was in its 
infancy. His first job was as principal analyst, covering 
transportation issues in what is now the Natural and Physical Resources 
Cost Estimates Unit of CBO&#x27;s Budget Analysis Division.

[[Page E989]]

  Bob quickly demonstrated his analytical skills and breadth of 
knowledge and was promoted in 1978 to become Unit Chief. In that role, 
he led his staff in providing high-quality and timely budgetary 
projections and analyses of legislative proposals on a wide range of 
topics, including energy, land and water management, disaster 
assistance, and banking--to name just a few.
  In 1995, Bob became the Budget Analysis Division&#x27;s Deputy Assistant 
Director, and in 1999 he was named CBO&#x27;s Assistant Director of Budget 
Analysis. In that capacity, he oversaw much of the agency&#x27;s work. He 
supervised the preparation of cost estimates and intergovernmental 
mandate statements for legislation being considered by the Congress. He 
also managed the preparation of the multiyear budget and economic 
projections that constitute the baseline for the Congressional budget 
process, the agency&#x27;s annual analyses of the President&#x27;s budget 
proposals, and CBO&#x27;s ongoing contributions to the Congressional budget 
scorekeeping system. He also continued in his role as the executive 
editor of the agency&#x27;s long-running Monthly Budget Review.
  In 2003, Bob received the James L. Blum Award for exceptional and 
distinguished accomplishment and leadership in public budgeting from 
the American Association for Budget and Program Analysis.
  Bob served as Acting Director of CBO from November 25, 2008, to 
January 22, 2009, before becoming Senior Adviser to the Director and 
unofficial quality control officer for CBO&#x27;s written products.
  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, CBO&#x27;s Director from 2003 to 2005, described Bob 
as ``the living heart of CBO. He has molded the agency, sustained its 
focus on its mission, and passed his wisdom along to generations of 
analysts--and Directors! It is hard to imagine CBO without him.&#x27;&#x27;
  Peter Orszag, CBO&#x27;s Director from 2007 to 2008 said, ``It is no 
exaggeration to say that CBO is what it is today--rigorous, 
independent, and widely respected--in no small part because of Bob 
Sunshine. For nearly half a century, he has worked in service of facts, 
good analysis, and sound policymaking. Bob&#x27;s counsel made me a better 
CBO Director, just as he has made better everyone who has been lucky 
enough to work alongside him. Most importantly, Bob has done all of 
this and more without losing his sense of humor and his humanity.&#x27;&#x27;
  Bob is highly regarded by Members of Congress, regardless of party 
affiliation, on both sides of the Capitol for his deep knowledge of the 
budget process and commitment to CBO&#x27;s role in that process.
  Paul Ryan, former Speaker of the House and Chairman of the House 
Committee on the Budget said, ``Bob Sunshine has made critical 
contributions over CBO&#x27;s entire history to ensure it developed and 
provided non-partisan and objective data and analyses to the Congress. 
Few can match the unwavering, sustained, and lengthy commitment Bob 
made to CBO.&#x27;&#x27;
  Bill Hoagland, a former staff director of the Senate Budget 
Committee, described Bob as ``Solid, steadfast, loyal, with unbending 
integrity. The rock for almost the entire span of CBO&#x27;s existence, Bob 
provided the `sunshine&#x27; to what otherwise can be a depressing subject--
the federal budget.&#x27;&#x27;
  Bob also is a lay leader of Congregation Har Shalom in Potomac, 
Maryland, and a devoted husband of 57 years to his wife Laurie, proud 
father of two sons, Ari (married to Jennifer) and Josh (married to 
Dara), and delighted grandfather to four grandchildren.
  His professional accomplishments set him apart, but it is his 
personal ethic--his optimism and thoughtful consideration for his 
friends and colleagues--that truly defines him. I wish him well as he 
moves on after decades of outstanding service to the Congress. I am 
grateful for that service, and I wish him the best in the years to 
come.

   HONORING JOHN DAVID LOGAN FOR EXCELLENCE AND EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARK E. GREEN

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John 
David ``JD&#x27;&#x27; Logan for his eminent service and dedication to the people 
of Tennessee&#x27;s Seventh District.
  Four and a half years ago, as Capitol Hill was wrestling with how to 
serve our constituents during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
JD joined our team in his last semester of college. He was instrumental 
in helping us respond to the unprecedented increase in correspondence 
and casework requests. Amidst these challenges, JD distinguished 
himself as a highly capable staffer with uncommon character.
  Since then, JD has been instrumental in countless projects and held 
numerous positions. He rose quickly in our office, from Legislative 
Correspondent to Legislative Assistant, and most recently, to Senior 
Legislative Assistant. Because of his skill set and reliability, he has 
taken on many projects outside his portfolio, including building our 
very successful internship program. As a testament to his leadership, 
we have hired multiple former interns to join our staff full-time.
  JD has served Tennessee&#x27;s Seventh District with commitment and 
distinction in every way. He has covered a wide swath of legislation, 
committee work, constituent services, correspondence, operations, and 
communications over his years on our team, and we are beyond grateful 
for his hard work and devoted service. In all that he does, he excels 
with diligence, and humility.
  Most recently, he has been invaluable to my work on the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee and a host of policy areas. His dedication to 
applying the principles of our founding to complex issues facing the 
Nation today has served our district--and our Nation--well.
  During his time on my team, our country has gone through much. All 
along, we have been grateful for his steadfast discipline and hard 
work. He tirelessly pursues truth and is a constant source of 
encouragement to all he encounters. As a staffer and as a leader, he 
carries himself with integrity and courage. It is difficult to fully 
express our deep appreciation for his faithful service to our office 
and our Nation. As a staffer, as a man, and as an American, he is of 
the highest quality.
  We are profoundly grateful for JD&#x27;s service to our office and the 
constituents of Tennessee&#x27;s Seventh District. JD&#x27;s zeal for our great 
Nation and its values, combined with his dogged dedication to the 
highest degree of excellence in all he does, marks him as a great 
American and invaluable servant to this country. Although it is with 
sadness to see JD&#x27;s time here in our office come to a close, we are 
confident he will continue to distinguish himself in public service 
across the Capitol. We wish him and his wife, Addison the very best. On 
behalf of Tennessee&#x27;s Seventh District, I commend JD for his excellent 
service and wish him well.

                        HONORING MANUEL MILANES

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Manuel 
Milanes Pizonero, a cherished friend of mine, constituent of Ave Maria, 
Florida, and a bold anti-communist voice within the Cuban American 
community in South Florida.
  On August 22, 2024, Manuel faced a life-altering situation few ever 
encounter in their lifetimes and made a heroic split-second decision 
even fewer choose to. As Manuel sat at home in his living room, a 
sudden loud sound like a crash broke the silence outside his home. 
Knowing his son had just stepped outside to take out the trash, Manuel 
immediately rushed out, fearing the very worst. Stepping onto the 
scene, he saw a man approaching a car in what appeared like a move to 
assist the family inside. As Manuel moved closer in an attempt to 
provide help, the man outside the car quickly asked him for a tool to 
break the car window, leading Manuel to go back inside to retrieve the 
appropriate device.
  Upon returning, however, the situation rapidly shifted when one of 
the passengers stuck inside the car cracked the window open begging 
Manuel not to break the window. The passenger quickly revealed that the 
man outside the car was armed and threatening to kill the mother and 
her four children inside. Manuel, demonstrating an incredible measure 
of bravery did not hesitate to act but began pleading with the 
assailant, even while unarmed, to stop, attempting to deescalate the 
situation and fervently insisting that he not act on his impulses and 
harm the family.
  At this, the man turned his weapon on Manuel, placing him directly in 
the line of fire, and instructed him to return to his home and stay out 
of it--yet Manuel refused to back down. Running back to his home, he 
grabbed his own gun, and quickly returned outside to help. However, in 
that short amount of time, the assailant managed to shatter the car 
window and force his way inside the car with the family. In seeing 
this, Manuel immediately stepped in to subdue him, once more placing 
himself in harm&#x27;s way in the hopes of disarming the shooter. Refusing 
to drop his firearm, the man turned the gun on Manuel once more, firing 
at him and hitting him in the left shoulder and chest, shattering his 
clavicle and causing severe blood loss. Despite being shot at two more 
times, Manuel held his ground, ready to protect the mother and her 
children as the shooter fled the scene. It took one instant and Manuel 
single-handedly changed the course of events in the lives of a mother 
and her four children, choosing selflessly to place their wellbeing 
before his own. Manuel narrowly escaped the ordeal with his life, with 
his heart stopping a total of 3 times mid-emergency surgery and 
requiring over 30 liters of transfusions. Though he faces a long road 
to recovery and subsequent surgeries, Manuel maintains that he would do 
it all over again if necessary. Since his successful discharge from the 
hospital, the community of Ave Maria has coalesced in a show of 
solidarity and pride around him, offering their prayers and support.
  Manuel Milanes is the preeminent example of the very kind-hearted, 
God-fearing and freedom-loving immigrant our country has long thrived 
as a result of. Originally from Cuba, Manuel made the United States his 
home in 2017 after living in the Dominican Republic, where he met his 
loving wife, Kenia Rodriguez. Together, they set down roots in the Ave 
Maria community, building a family and a successful business. He notes 
that it is his Christian faith that has guided him in choosing a 
business that serves others, while also providing generously for the 
families of his 50 employees.
  Beyond his business pursuits, Manuel is a passionate anti-communist 
freedom fighter who has never forgotten his Cuban roots or the mission 
of achieving true democratic freedom for Cuba. Turning his convictions 
into action, Manuel created a YouTube channel dedicated expressly to 
denouncing the brutal Castro regime&#x27;s human rights abuses and raising 
funds to support political prisoners and their families in Cuba. To 
this day, he remains blacklisted by the regime for speaking out against 
the ruthless dictatorship.
  Through his efforts, he has successfully provided medicine, food, and 
financial support to those still fighting for freedom, both in the 
opposition and those wrongfully imprisoned under the regime&#x27;s 
oppressive hand.
  Exemplary citizens like Manuel Milanes are the very reason I remain 
hopeful for the future of our Nation and remain convinced the American 
Dream is yet alive and well today. His unrestrained willingness to risk 
his life for others, his unwavering commitment to freedom, and his deep 
faith make him a true patriot and a living example of the values we 
cherish in this great Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Manuel 
Milanes Pizonero, a hero who represents the best of America. We remain 
forever grateful to him and his family for their selfless contributions 
to our community and our country.

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hooksett Lions Club 
Citizen of the Year Richard ``Turk&#x27;&#x27; Bairam. For over 25 years, Turk 
has been dedicated to supporting Hooksett in any way he can. He 
continues to volunteer in his community to make Hooksett an amazing 
place to live and raise a family.
  A lifelong resident of Hooksett, Turk owned and operated his own auto 
repair shop for 36 years before retiring in 2006. A former member of 
the Hooksett Police Commission, Turk currently serves as Sewer 
Commissioner, Chair of the Central Hooksett Water Precinct, as a member 
of the Town Recycling and Transfer Committee, and on the Zoning Board 
of Appeals.
  In addition to his volunteer work, he has also dedicated his life to 
his family. Turk and his wife of 62 years, Mary, have raised their 
children, grandchildren, and now great grandchildren in Hooksett. It is 
because of the hard work and dedication of community leaders like Turk 
that the Town of Hooksett continues to thrive.
  On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I congratulate Turk for being named the Hooksett Lions Club 
2024 Citizen of the Year. I wish Turk and his family all the best in 
the years to come as they continue to work to make Hooksett a better 
place.

         HONORING THE LIFE OF DANNY KATZ, THE WORKERS&#x27; CHAMPION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JAMIE RASKIN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a constituent who devoted 
his extraordinary life to the fight for worker justice. From the 
restaurant workers of Washington, D.C. to the staffers who keep Capitol 
Hill running, all of Daniel Katz&#x27;s clients found in him a champion for 
dignity, fair wages and working conditions. On July 25, 2024, Danny&#x27;s 
loved ones lost a treasured husband, father, and friend and the world 
lost a principled, persistent and brilliant public servant.
  Danny was driven by his conviction that worker justice is the 
foundation of a just society. He believed in the fundamental principle 
that a dignified workplace for even the lowest paid workers raises the 
standards all for all workers. After working for a private practice 
specializing in employment law, Danny founded the District of Columbia 
Employment Justice Center, becoming its first director. It also didn&#x27;t 
matter which court heard one of his client&#x27;s cases; over the course of 
his career, Danny represented clients before every one of the federal, 
state and local courts in Maryland and D.C.
  For Danny, his duties to his clients extended beyond the courtroom. 
He advocated for legislation at the D.C. City Council on worker pay 
issues and testified before the U.S. Congress on the rampant menace of 
wage theft. He lent his considerable talents pro bono to clients 
seeking assistance from the Public Justice Center in Baltimore, the 
Maryland Legal Aid Bureau, the Woman&#x27;s Law Center of Maryland and the 
Sexual Assault Legal Institute. He was dedicated to sharing his wealth 
of knowledge with his fellow attorneys, frequently teaching continuing 
education courses for lawyers on litigating claims under wage-and-hour 
laws and how his colleagues could most effectively represent immigrants 
and low-wage workers.
  At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Danny maintained his focus on 
the most vulnerable workers in our communities. After establishing 
accessible legal clinics for workers across the DMV, he ensured that 
the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs 
could keep these clinics open virtually and continue providing 
services. The clinic didn&#x27;t miss a single week as Danny and a team of 
like-minded lawyers served workers seeking legal aid when they needed 
it most. Danny used his membership in the National Employment Lawyers 
Association to build both solidarity and expertise among members of the 
labor bar.
  By the time he reached the House of Representatives as Senior Counsel 
at the Office of Employee Advocacy (OEA), Danny had 25 years of 
experience advocating for workers. He had earned numerous accolades, 
including the Maryland Employment Lawyers Association ``Excellence in 
Advocacy&#x27;&#x27; award and the ``Visionary Award&#x27;&#x27; in 2018 for his work with 
the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault. Just as he had done in 
every job prior to the House OEA, Danny acted as a dedicated mentor to 
his colleagues and aspiring attorneys and a fierce advocate for his 
clients.
  His loss is profound and sharply felt in our community. I join the 
people of Maryland&#x27;s beautiful Eighth District in honoring the life of 
Danny Katz, a titan in the fight for workers&#x27; rights, and in sending my 
condolences to his wife Lael, his son and his daughter Lucia. May 
Danny&#x27;s memory be a blessing.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an 
op-ed by Lisa Rimland for recognizing Tim Colburn&#x27;s career of courage, 
compassion, and care for those who are most in need and often 
forgotten.
  I have known Tim Colburn all my life. We grew up together in a 
federal housing project called Mayberry Village, named after the 
legendary Dr. Franklin Mayberry of East Hartford. We jokingly referred 
to it as the `Cardboard City.&#x27; Tim was then always caring, 
compassionate, and competitive--excelling at everything he did. In 
sports, he was probably the best all-around athlete in the Village and 
in the town we grew up in; he especially excelled at track and field, 
which require individual athleticism.
  His love of people, with special attention to the underserved and the 
underdogs, is legendary. It was an honor for me to know and count Tim 
as a true friend. I stand in awe of his selfless leadership and 
accomplishments. He was never concerned about taking credit and always 
did the right thing because that is how he was raised and what he 
valued.
  Lisa Rimland&#x27;s op-ed in the Hartford Courant confirms what the world 
should know about Tim. They attest to Tim Coburn&#x27;s contributions to his 
family, his friends, his community and associations, and the state and 
Nation he loved.

       One of the hardest-working people in Connecticut, who has 
     spent virtually his whole life doing good, retired recently. 
     What he accomplished should be shouted from the rooftops but 
     few people know his name because the world in which he worked 
     is not a world that is spoken about often. In many ways it is 
     not that well-known, yet it affects most of us intimately and 
     inevitably.
       The man is Timothy Coburn, and for decades he has 
     functioned as a court-appointed ``receiver,&#x27;&#x27; a person who 
     goes into nursing homes and other care facilities that are in 
     trouble, financially and/or otherwise, and tries to save 
     them. In these situations, the human stakes are very high. If 
     the problems in a home cannot be fixed or the home cannot be 
     sold, the home may have to be closed, resulting in transfer 
     trauma risks for frail residents and patients and the loss of 
     jobs for countless employees.
       The world of nursing homes has recently become better 
     publicized because of the COVID pandemic. With what they have 
     gone

[[Page E986]]

     through, these homes are now firmly in mythological 
     territory, as is Mr. Coburn. I first became aware of Mr. 
     Coburn and his world in July of 2012 when the care home I was 
     living in was put into receivership by the Superior Court due 
     to various problems. I was living in the care home because 
     after I was declared disabled in 2004, I could not find 
     housing assistance in Mansfield.
       On the evening of July 18, 2012, after Mr. Coburn had just 
     been appointed receiver of the home in which I lived, a quick 
     but violent thunderstorm knocked out the power, and the 
     generator failed. I called and reported the situation to 
     Barbara Cass of the Department of Public Health, and within 
     an hour a truck arrived hauling a new generator which was 
     hooked up to restore power. Mr. Coburn had rented the 
     generator. This is only one example of Mr. Coburn&#x27;s constant 
     generosity. If a home that he was in charge of needed 
     something, he would go out right away and buy it with his own 
     money, then later get reimbursed by the court. If anyone 
     living in one of his homes had exceptional needs or 
     circumstances, he accommodated them. He was always available 
     to lend a helping hand, a listening ear, or a ride to 
     dialysis.
       Skilled-nursing facilities have been his specialty. A 
     nursing home receivership usually lasts about two years, but 
     Mr. Coburn&#x27;s last one ran through the pandemic and is 
     approaching four under another receiver. Miraculously, he 
     remained healthy through most of the pandemic. Few of us can 
     imagine what he and all those responsible for running the 
     homes went through during the pandemic. But if you visit the 
     homes now, and even more so if you live in the homes, you can 
     see and feel the pandemic&#x27;s mark, almost as if you were 
     visiting a country where a terrible war was fought: the 
     bodies&#x27;of the casualties are gone, but you can feel their 
     presence everywhere. It is quiet and peaceful, yet with 
     echoes of an unspeakable past, and the words ``God willing&#x27;&#x27; 
     are appended to every plan.
       This is the world that Mr. Coburn left, having served the 
     frailest citizens of our state during both peace and 
     metaphoric wartime. It was in these homes that the most 
     helpless of the pandemic&#x27;s victims died, and that many of the 
     most courageous of the healthcare workers fought to save as 
     many as they could, and to save themselves. Many people shun 
     the world of these homes even if they have family members 
     living in them. This is a tragedy in many ways, because there 
     are lessons to be learned in the homes that cannot be learned 
     from books, lessons for the heart as well as the mind, 
     lessons in compassion and even keys to the mysteries of war 
     and peace. Eventually, most of us will occupy a bed in one of 
     these homes. Why wait until then to visit?
       If more people embraced the homes with the love, compassion 
     and enthusiasm of Mr. Coburn, it would be a better world for 
     all of us, both inside and outside the homes. If there is one 
     sure lesson that can be learned from the pandemic and the 
     homes, this is it.

   RECOGNIZING LOIS LANGER THOMPSON FOR HER DEDICATED SERVICE TO OUR 
                            PUBLIC LIBRARIES

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Ms. Lois Langer 
Thompson for nearly 40 years of invaluable service to our public 
library systems. Since 2018 Lois has passionately led Sno-Isle 
Libraries as Executive Director, which provides service to over 800,000 
residents across Snohomish and Island counties. Prior to moving to 
Washington, she served the Hennepin County Library.
  I first met Lois in 2019 at the former Lake Stevens Historical 
Society and Museum, when she told me about her plans to expand Sno-
Isle&#x27;s library system in Lake Stevens with a new, larger library for 
the community. Since then, I have had the pleasure of working with her 
and watching her cultivate a thriving library community in Washington&#x27;s 
First Congressional District and beyond.
  Under Lois&#x27; leadership, Sno-Isle Libraries has embedded equity across 
the organization, built a capital strategy to connect everyone to their 
local library, completed three library construction projects in 
Darrington, Edmonds, and Mill Creek, invested in digital equity, 
launched a commitment to sustainability, expanded the Foundation Board 
of Directors, strengthened community collaboration, and supported the 
formation of the first collective bargaining unit for employees. Lois 
also guided the organization through a pandemic, while adopting new 
services to allow Sno-Isle to continue providing essential resources to 
our communities.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Langer 
Thompson and wishing her the best in her retirement. We are grateful 
for her contributions to the community and will cherish her legacy of 
service and commitment to creating inspiring, welcoming spaces.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Mushroom House 
Automotive, a veteran and family-owned business out of Colora, Cecil 
County, Maryland, as it approaches its 30th anniversary on October 1, 
2024.
  Originally a mushroom farm operated by the Webb family for over 40 
years, the business transitioned into an automotive repair and sales 
center after being pushed out of the industry. In 2006, Mushroom House 
survived a devastating fire that destroyed the shop and several classic 
cars. It was rebuilt and reopened only with the support and dedication 
of the local community.
  Today, Mushroom House Automotive continues to serve Cecil County and 
provide top-notch, honest automotive services under the leadership of 
Victor ``Butch&#x27;&#x27; Webb Sr., his son Steven Webb and with the expertise 
of Archie Singleton II. Together, they have raised over $300,000 
through their vehicle donation program for various non-profit 
organizations and consistently support the community, including 
participating in Career Day at Rising Sun Middle School and the CCPS 
Summer Work Program, where they pair students with local businesses. 
Mushroom House Automotive also partners with the Cecil County School of 
Technology&#x27;s Automotive program to teach and support the next 
generation of mechanics and car enthusiasts.
  In the last three years, Mushroom House Automotive has placed in the 
top three of Cecil Whig&#x27;s Community Choice in Automotive Salesperson--
Used Cars, Auto Repair, Oil Change, Pre-Owned Vehicle Sales and Tires. 
In addition, Steven Webb and Archie Singleton II were honored as 
business leaders and inducted into the National Technical Honor 
Society, a recognition spearheaded by Scott Coutu, the Automotive 
Technology instructor at the Cecil County School of Technology.
  I am proud and grateful to Mushroom House Automotive for its 
continued service of over 30 years to the community. Small, family-
owned businesses like these constitute the backbone of American economy 
and provide essential services to local communities.

        RECOGNIZING PHILIP GIBBONS ON 50 YEARS OF BROADCASTING-

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN W. ROSE

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a name--and voice--
known to countless Tennesseans. Philip Gibbons is celebrating 50 years 
in radio, most of which having been spent as host of the midday show on 
94.7 The Country Giant. The station reaches more than 120,000 listeners 
across 19 counties, spanning Middle Tennessee and Southern Kentucky. 
That&#x27;s a lot of people who look forward to hearing him day after day.
  His broadcast career started at 15-years-old, before he was old 
enough to drive. The year was 1974 and the gig was part-time janitor 
and disc jockey for WPTN in Cookeville, Tenn.
  Fifty years later, Gibbons is a member of the Tennessee Radio Hall of 
Fame. He&#x27;s been selected as a regular stage host at the CMA Music Fest 
and a guest announcer at the Grand Ole Opry many times in recent years. 
In 2020, Philip was awarded Small Market Personality of the Year by 
Country Aircheck, the leading trade publication for the industry. 
Philip was also nominated by the Academy of Country Music for Small 
Market Personality of the Year.
  When asked why he never left Cookeville behind for a larger radio 
market, he responded, ``this is where my heart is. This is my 
community.&#x27;&#x27; He not only spent his entire career in that community, but 
he also gives back to it every chance he gets.
  Since 1983, he&#x27;s served as the public address announcer for Tennessee 
Tech University football and basketball games. He&#x27;s also volunteered 
his time and used his platform to support many causes over the years, 
including Habitat for Humanity, St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, 
Alzheimer&#x27;s Tennessee, and the American Cancer Society. Gibbons is 
known by some as the `pink tie guy&#x27; in the Upper Cumberland for his 
dedication to bringing awareness in the fight against breast cancer 
through wearing a pink tie. Following the devastation from Hurricane 
Michael, Philip used his airtime to ask listeners to fill an 18-wheeler 
with supplies to help the folks of Panama City Beach recover.
  From interviewing up-and-coming artists to the legends, Philip has 
built a name for himself in Cookeville, in Music City, and throughout 
the County Music family. He&#x27;s seen a lot of change in the business 
throughout his career. Today, automation and pre-recorded announcements 
are commonplace in radio, but Philip remembers well the days of live-
only broadcasts and actual turn tables.
  I want to congratulate Philip on 50 years in radio and wish him many 
more years of success ahead.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY STUDY 
                            INSTITUTE (EESI)

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Environmental 
and Energy Study Institute (EESI) on 40 years of working with Congress 
and providing policymakers with educational resources about climate, 
clean energy, and environmental topics.
  To address climate change, we need durable policies that support 
impactful climate solutions that withstand the ups and downs of 
Washington. That requires us to work across the aisle and craft 
bipartisan legislation. Thankfully, there is more common ground on 
combatting climate change than ever before, and the bipartisan Climate 
Solutions Caucus is providing a unique space for Members who share my 
interest in paving the way forward together.
  EESI also understands the value of finding common ground and has been 
a true partner to the Caucus in helping to educate members on a 
multitude of topics, including the advancement of climate solutions in 
the Farm Bill, natural climate solutions, carbon sequestration, 
community resilience, and climate negotiations on the international 
stage during the U.N. Conference of Parties.
  During my time in Congress, I have always appreciated EESI&#x27;s ability 
to deliver timely, nonpartisan, science-based educational resources in 
formats that my staff and I can use to serve the constituents of the 
Sixth District of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. EESI&#x27;s 
partnership has directly supported the educational efforts that the 
bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus has facilitated for its Members and 
staff. Building bipartisan collaboration around data-driven climate 
solutions will keep the United States on a course to meet its climate 
goals while revitalizing the economy, safeguarding energy security, and 
providing cost-effective, cleaner power for everyday Americans.
  EESI has a long history of working on climate and environmental 
issues regardless of which party is in the White House. EESI&#x27;s 
predecessor organization dates back to the time of Richard Nixon, and 
EESI itself was established as an independent nonprofit organization 
during Ronald Reagan&#x27;s first term. The organization began its work on 
climate change under the George H.W. Bush Administration and, more 
recently, it has extensively tracked the historic climate investments 
passed by the House and Senate during the Biden Administration. This 
history exemplifies EESI&#x27;s commitment to facilitating constructive, 
bipartisan dialogues around how to bast combat climate change.
  Congratulations to EESI on 40 years of working alongside Congress and 
promoting durable, bipartisan climate solutions. I wish EESI all the 
best for the next 40 years of advancing solutions, fostering 
bipartisanship, supporting rural communities, and cultivating young 
leaders.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Merced County 
Community Action Agency (MCCAA) in celebrating sixty years of service. 
MCCAA began serving Dos Palos in 1964 and opened its first Head Start 
center in 1965. MCCAA is part of a nationwide movement that began with 
the signing of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 by President Lyndon 
B. Johnson. MCCAA&#x27;s mission is to serve, advocate, and collaborate for 
those in need by developing innovative strategies for self-empowerment.
  MCCAA gainfully employs nearly 200 people and serves over 17,000 
unduplicated customers every month with a total of sixteen federal and 
state programs. The work MCCAA provides for the community would be 
impossible without our local community, who last year volunteered over 
14,000 hours. Last year, MCCAA housed over 112 formerly unhoused 
community members with safe, affordable homes. Over 400 children 
utilize their free preschool programs for early learning and education. 
MCCAA provides 1,500 families with utility assistance, keeping families 
safe during scorching Valley summers.
  The MCCAA maintains over sixteen other locations in Merced County, 
and partners with over 200 local service providers, government 
agencies, and families to help with outreach, referrals and access to 
needed services. The D Street Navigation Center is open year-round, 
twenty-four hours per day to meet the needs of Merced County&#x27;s most 
vulnerable living on the streets. Last year, over 514 unhoused 
individuals stayed at this Center.
  MCAA continues to expand. MCAA recently added a diaper bank, a summer 
food program, and expanded support for at risk pregnant and new 
mothers.
  Therefore Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House 
of Representatives to join me in celebrating the MCCAA for 60 years of 
service to our Valley.

   RECOGNIZING THE SAMARITAN&#x27;S PURSE FLOOD RECOVERY RESPONSE IN EAST

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 27, 2024

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express immense 
gratitude on behalf of the people of Eastern Kentucky who have received 
flood recovery assistance from Samaritan&#x27;s Purse during two back-to-
back disaster relief missions, starting in 2021.
  Breathitt County has essentially become a second home to some team 
members of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, who first arrived in our region after a 
major flood in March 2021. They have provided the most comprehensive 
response efforts, rallying volunteers from across the country to help 
muck-out damaged homes, provide cleaning supplies and food to flood 
victims, and resources to help rebuild homes. The crew dedicated an 
entire year of service to our region and had only been gone for a few 
days before a second catastrophic flood hit the heart of our region in 
July 2022, taking the lives of 45 Kentuckians. Without hesitation, the 
Samaritan&#x27;s Purse tractor trailer reloaded supplies and turned around 
to head right back to Breathitt County. Our region was briefly crippled 
by the widespread impact of that overnight flood that took out power 
lines, washed out critical roadways and bridges, damaged thousands of 
homes and vehicles, leaving hundreds of Eastern Kentucky families 
homeless in an instant.
  Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of individuals across the 
country, donations flooded into our region, giving flood survivors a 
glimmer of hope for the long journey ahead. Many organizations, like 
Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, also dispatched recovery teams to our region, 
helping sustain families through their darkest hour. As various crews 
expended as many resources as possible to aid Eastern Kentucky, there 
has been one constant team remaining long after everyone else had to 
leave--and that is Samaritan&#x27;s Purse. For every meal provided, every 
mop distributed, every bucket of mud carried out, every nail that has 
been driven and every prayer that has been prayed in our region, I want 
to personally express my gratitude to Samaritan&#x27;s Purse.
  This organization has carried out the vision of the late evangelist 
Bob Pierce for more than 50 years, which he established ``to meet 
emergency needs in crisis areas through existing evangelical mission 
agencies and national churches.&#x27;&#x27; Rev. Franklin Graham took up the 
mantel over 40 years ago, spreading the same kindness, generosity and 
steadfast hope around the world.
  We are blessed that Samaritan&#x27;s Purse found our small corner of rural 
America and made our people a priority when they needed it the most. As 
a result of their dedication, we are now celebrating with flood 
survivors in Breathitt County who now have a safe, new house to call 
home. On behalf of Eastern Kentuckians in Breathitt and surrounding 
counties, we thank them for standing with us through the flood and long 
after the flood waters have receded. May God continue to multiply the 
efforts of Samaritan&#x27;s Purse as they rebuild hope in the mountains of 
Eastern Kentucky and beyond.

  Ms. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an individual 
whose unwavering dedication to education has transformed countless 
lives and communities: Dr. Paul Gothold. Throughout his distinguished 
career, Dr. Gothold has epitomized the values of equity, inclusivity, 
and excellence in education, ensuring that every child has access to 
the opportunities they need to thrive.
  Dr. Gothold&#x27;s journey in education began over three decades ago as a 
teacher, where he worked tirelessly with adjudicated, probation, and 
expelled youth in Los Angeles. From these early experiences, he 
developed a deep understanding of the challenges facing underserved 
communities and a steadfast commitment to addressing them.
  As he advanced in his career, Dr. Gothold continued to demonstrate 
exceptional leadership and innovation. As Superintendent of Lynwood 
Unified in Los Angeles, he led the district to remarkable achievements, 
including increasing graduation rates from 58 percent to 90 percent at 
all comprehensive high schools. Under his stewardship, Lynwood Unified 
was honored as the College Board District of the Year, a testament to 
its success in expanding AP participation and passage rates for 
underserved populations.
  Beyond his role as district leader, Dr. Gothold has also made a 
significant contributions to educator preparation and professional 
development. As an adjunct professor at the University of Southern 
California, he has mentored and coached numerous aspiring and sitting 
superintendents, shaping the next generation of education leaders.
  In 2017, Dr. Gothold assumed the role of San Diego County 
Superintendent, where his impact has been nothing short of 
transformative. His visionary leadership has led to the creation of 
groundbreaking initiatives and partnerships that have enriched the 
educational experiences of students across the county.
  One of Dr. Gothold&#x27;s key accomplishments has been his commitment to 
ensuring school safety and addressing the needs of vulnerable 
populations. Through partnerships with the San Diego District 
Attorney&#x27;s office, he developed county-wide school safety protocols and 
training to prevent human trafficking. Additionally, he spearheaded 
initiatives to support foster, homeless, and adjudicated youth, 
including the creation of innovative programs and pathways to success.
  Under Dr. Gothold&#x27;s leadership, San Diego County has become a beacon 
of educational innovation and excellence. From pioneering programs in 
drug prevention and awareness to establishing the first HBCU satellite 
program in California, his initiatives have set new standards for 
educational equity and access.
  Furthermore, Dr, Gothold&#x27;s dedication to equity and inclusion has 
been recognized through numerous awards and accolades, including the 
ASCD California Instructional Leadership Award and the California 
County Superintendents Superintendent of the Year award. His tireless 
advocacy for marginalized communities has earned him the respect and 
admiration of colleagues and stakeholders across the state and Nation.
  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Dr. Paul Gothold for his extraordinary contributions to education and 
his unwavering commitment to ensuring that every child has the 
opportunity to succeed. His legacy will continue to inspire generations 
of educators and serve as a guiding light for the pursuit of 
educational equity and excellence.
