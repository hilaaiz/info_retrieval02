             CELEBRATING SCOTT W. HOBSON ON HIS RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JEFF HURD

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. HURD of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate Scott W. Hobson of Pueblo, Colorado, as he retires from the 
Pueblo City Planning &amp; Community Development Department.
  Scott&#x27;s career in public service began in Canon City, where he served 
as Director of the Fremont County Special District Parks and 
Recreation. During that time, he earned two national certifications--
Certified Parks and Recreation Professional and Certified Parks and 
Recreation Executive. One of his proudest accomplishments there was 
helping create the Arkansas River Trail and launching recreational 
programs that brought the community together.
  In 1980, Scott married Janice Chambers, and together they raised 
three wonderful daughters, Cindi Selvage, Amanda Hobson, and Lauren 
Snell.
  Scott continued his public service in Summit County as an Open Space 
Manager, focusing on preserving the beauty and open land of the region. 
In 1998, he and his family made the move to Pueblo, a place they have 
called home ever since. Scott began working with the City of Pueblo, 
where, for more than two decades, he became a key figure in shaping and 
strengthening the community.
  From the Historic Arkansas Riverwalk to Kayak Park and river 
restoration efforts, Scott brought energy, vision, and a deep sense of 
care to every project. His understanding of Pueblo&#x27;s history is second 
to none, and he has always had a heart for building strong, vibrant 
neighborhoods.
  Scott&#x27;s legacy is one of service, dedication, and a genuine love for 
Southern Colorado. We thank him for all he has given, and we wish him 
the very best in this next chapter.

           CELEBRATING THE CITY OF RAYTOWN&#x27;S 75TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of Raytown 
as it celebrates the 75th anniversary of its incorporation as a city. 
Finding its foundations as a crossroads for road-weary travelers, this 
city remains one of the warmest and most welcoming communities in my 
district.
  Raytown&#x27;s rich history begins long before its incorporation, 
stretching back to the 1820&#x27;s when pioneers transversing the Santa Fe 
Trail built a small settlement there. A mere day&#x27;s journey from 
Independence via covered wagon, Raytown represented the final township 
for settlers and adventurers to stock up on supplies. Cattle, oxen, 
fresh fruits and vegetables were commonly purchased from farmers in the 
area. Skilled laborers such as blacksmiths, wagon repairmen, and iron 
workers began to settle in the area as well, responding to a growing 
need for their expertise along the wagon trains.
  One such laborer, a blacksmith named William Ray, moved to Jackson 
County in 1848 and established his forge at the crossroads of the Santa 
Fe Trail with other local trails. Ray&#x27;s shop, and even Ray himself, 
soon became a prominent landmark, and by 1854, the area was known as 
``Ray&#x27;s Town,&#x27;&#x27; which eventually turned to ``Raytown&#x27;&#x27;. The city&#x27;s 
legacy as a center of trails and as a rendezvous meeting point, echoes 
today in the community&#x27;s strong network of parks, historic sites, and 
trails throughout the city.
  A century after people began to call the area Raytown, residents 
acted to legally incorporate the city on July 17, 1950. They mobilized 
in response to Kansas City&#x27;s annexation of surrounding towns and began 
signing petitions to remain a distinct locality from Kansas City, 
showing the same streak of local pride, fierce autonomy, and initiative 
that still embodies Raytown and its residents 75 years later.
  Raytown&#x27;s community has changed substantially since its advent, from 
the city&#x27;s agrarian roots to a suburban business hub. The city began 
with a single store, a post office, and a doctor&#x27;s office, but 
currently hosts over 2,500 businesses, a testament to how the city has 
expanded over the years. Its proximity to Kansas City and small-town 
charm makes it appealing to city commuters looking for a slower pace to 
life. Just over 30,000 residents call Raytown home, truly making it a 
small city with huge opportunity. Raytown&#x27;s residents can enjoy a 
thriving community that offers a wide variety of amenities. Visitors 
stop by to enjoy Raytown&#x27;s rich history, including the Rice-Tremonti 
Home and Cave Spring--both former campsites for wagon trains--as well 
as the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California Trail crossings.
  Raytown&#x27;s welcoming atmosphere and small-town feel exemplify the 
values of Missouri&#x27;s 5th District, and the city&#x27;s recent revitalization 
efforts come just in time for our district to welcome thousands of 
international visitors next year for the 2026 World Cup. As Raytown 
prepares, I am sure that visitors will experience the same hospitality 
that I know so well. On behalf of Missouri&#x27;s Fifth Congressional 
District, I congratulate Raytown on its 75th Anniversary of 
incorporation and may its community enjoy many more years of prosperity 
and fellowship.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Sue Ann 
McClellan, the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law 
Assistant Dean for Admissions, who will be retiring on July 30 after 30 
years.
  Dean McClellan has guided students at my law school alma mater into 
the legal profession by keeping a close eye on undergraduate prospects, 
encouraging applicants, evaluating candidates and then watching them 
mature through the bar exam and on to successful legal careers both 
locally and across the country. She was instrumental in the creation of 
the Summer Law Intern Program (known as SLIP), which encourages diverse 
and talented high school students to work as interns in private law 
practices, corporate law offices and government agencies, often 
spurring an early interest in pursuing the profession. She was also 
involved in the school&#x27;s response to COVID-19, by addressing the 
ongoing decline in enrollment, and in the School&#x27;s 2010 move from the 
main university campus to the former U.S. Customs House, Court House 
and Post Office building on the Mississippi River Bluff downtown. She 
is a 1976 graduate of Blackburn College in Carlinville, Illinois, with 
a degree in Sociology. She received a Master&#x27;s degree in Higher 
Education Administration in 1985 from Southern Illinois University--
Carbondale, and a Doctor of Education degree in Higher Education 
Administration in 1995 from the University of Memphis.
  Through the years, Dean McClellan has been like a mother to students 
and follows their careers with pride. In a statement released by the 
University, Dean McClellan said: ``I&#x27;ve always felt that listening is 
such a critical element of building a relationship. And relationships 
are what all of this is built upon.&#x27;&#x27;
  I congratulate Dean McClellan for a stellar career advancing legal 
education and helping produce the talented legal professionals for 
which the university is known.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the 
following obituary of Charles P. Gaylor, III.

                    Charles P. Gaylor, III Obituary

       Charles ``Charlie&#x27;&#x27; Parson Gaylor, III, a beloved husband, 
     father, grandfather, and dedicated servant to the Goldsboro 
     community, passed away on July 1, 2025, at the age of 75.
       Born and raised in Goldsboro, North Carolina, Charlie was 
     the son of the late Judge Charles P. Gaylor, Jr. and the late 
     Councilwoman Mildred Ellis Gaylor. A lifelong resident of the 
     city he so passionately served, Charlie&#x27;s legacy is deeply 
     woven into the civic, legal, and cultural fabric of Wayne 
     County.
       Charlie graduated from Goldsboro High School in 1967 before 
     earning a double Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and 
     Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
     Hill. He went on to receive his Juris Doctor from the 
     Delaware Law School of Widener University in Wilmington, 
     Delaware.
       Charlie practiced law in Goldsboro from 1977 to 2008 and 
     went on to serve with distinction as a District Court Judge 
     from 2009 to 2022. Even in retirement, he continued to serve 
     as a recalled judge.
       His professional and civic contributions were extensive and 
     impactful. He held leadership roles in numerous 
     organizations, including serving as Chair of the Wayne County 
     Chamber of Commerce and the Wayne County Economic Development 
     Commission. He also served as the inaugural Chair of the 
     Wayne County Development Alliance. Charlie was a dedicated 
     member of the Wayne County Bar Association, North Carolina 
     State Bar, and North Carolina Bar Association. He was also an 
     avid supporter and past board member of the Foundation of 
     Wayne Community College, the Arts Council of Wayne County, 
     the Wayne County Public Library Foundation, the Downtown 
     Goldsboro Development Corporation, the Wayne County Historic 
     Association, the Military Affairs Committee of the Wayne 
     County Chamber of Commerce, and the Goldsboro Civitan Club.
       Charlie was passionate about historic preservation and 
     cultural enrichment, having served as President of the 
     Historic Preservation Society of North Carolina and as a tour 
     guide for the Goldsboro Union Station Project. His efforts 
     were pivotal in safeguarding the architectural and historical 
     heritage of the region.
       He also dedicated his time and leadership to a broad array 
     of community initiatives--rom small business development and 
     civic education to passenger rail service advocacy and 
     military appreciation events. Notably, he co-chaired the 1976 
     Wayne County Bicentennial ``Town Forum&#x27;&#x27; series alongside his 
     wife, Rhonda.
       Among his many accolades, Charlie was honored with the 
     Jaycees Distinguished Service Award, the Exchange Club Book 
     of Golden Deeds Award, the Gertrude S.

[[Page E683]]

     Carraway Award of Merit, and the prestigious Cannon Cup from 
     the North Carolina Division of Cultural Resources. He was 
     also the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the 
     Downtown Goldsboro Development Corporation and was inducted 
     into the North Carolinian Society, an honor reserved for 
     individuals who have rendered distinguished service to the 
     state.
       Charlie was a member of First Presbyterian Church of 
     Goldsboro, where he found spiritual grounding and community 
     fellowship.
       He is survived by his loving wife of 52 years, Rhonda 
     McDonald Gaylor; his son, Charles P. Gaylor, IV and daughter-
     in-law, Sarah Gaylor; and his cherished grandson, Charles 
     ``Charlie&#x27;&#x27; Gaylor, V.
       A celebration of Charlie&#x27;s life will be held Monday, July 7 
     at 11:00 a.m. at First Presbyterian Church of Goldsboro. The 
     family will receive friends following the service in the 
     church&#x27;s activity center. A private burial for the family 
     will take place at Willow Dale Cemetery.
       In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to First 
     Presbyterian Church, 1101 E. Ash Street, Goldsboro, NC 27530 
     or the charity of one&#x27;s choice.
       Charlie Gaylor&#x27;s life was one of selfless devotion--to 
     justice, to heritage, to education, and to the people and 
     places he held dear. His legacy lives on in the institutions 
     he shaped, the community he strengthened, and the countless 
     lives he touched through a lifetime of committed service.

                                 ______

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to the life and 
legacy of Lee Clark, a soft-spoken and kind country gentleman, a loving 
husband, an amazing father, and a true friend. Lee passed into the arms 
of our Lord on Friday, June 27, 2025. His loss is deeply felt by all 
who had the privilege of knowing him.
  A sixth-generation Texan and rancher, Lee exemplified the values of 
integrity, diligence, and quiet strength that define the best of rural 
Texas. Born and raised in Menard, Lee Clark, a steward of the land, 
devoted his life to the care of his livestock and range. His tireless 
work ethic, principled nature, and gift for storytelling earned him the 
respect and affection of all who knew him.

[[Page E682]]

  On September 8, 1990, Lee married his best friend and the love of his 
life, Lisa Price Clark. Together they built a life centered on faith, 
family, and hard work. Lee was a devoted father to his two daughters, 
Candice and Madelon, and he was endlessly proud of the women they 
became. He was dearly loved by his family and inspired those who 
crossed his path with his encouragement.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Lee Clark--a 
devoted family man, a true Texas rancher, a pillar of his community, 
and a man who lived with steadfast purpose. May God grant comfort and 
peace to Lisa, Candice, Madelon, and all who mourn his loss. May Lee&#x27;s 
memory be a blessing, and may he rest in eternal peace.

             NTIA POLICY AND CYBERSECURITY COORDINATION ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. ZOE LOFGREN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1766, 
The NTIA Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act.
  The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or 
NTIA, is a critical agency within the Department of Commerce that works 
across the Federal government to develop telecommunications and 
information policy. Congress should support this agency and give it the 
resources and authorities it needs to fulfill its current mission. 
However, this bill would waste taxpayer dollars by unnecessarily 
duplicating activities already authorized by Congress.
  The NTIA was originally part of its sister agency, the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology. Since Congress established NTIA 
as its own agency in 1978, the two agencies have carried out 
complementary but distinct areas of work. NIST serves as an 
independent, unbiased arbiter of trusted measurements and standards 
while NTIA has its regulatory responsibilities.
  These two agencies often work together, unfortunately this bill would 
swell NTIA&#x27;s mission into a cybersecurity role to which it does not 
possess the appropriate experience or expertise and blur the lines 
between the agencies, especially on issues related to cybersecurity. 
For example, Congress authorized NIST, in collaboration with CISA, to 
conduct a cybersecurity activity related to the internet and 
communications networks in the Cybersecurity Enhancements Act of 2014, 
the CHIPS and Science Act of 2020, the HACKED Act of 2021, and more. 
H.R. 1766 would directly duplicate, at NTIA, those ongoing efforts 
underway at NIST. There is also a provision in the bill that implicates 
agencies outside of the Department of Commerce by duplicating the 
Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s information technology supply chain 
security programs.
  This Act was included as part of a broader NTIA Reauthorization that 
was considered in

[[Page E681]]

the 118th Congress. At the time, the Department of Commerce weighed in 
requesting significant changes to the provision that are unfortunately 
not included in the Act we will consider today. As such, this bill 
merits further vetting and input from the Department of Commerce.
  This bill needs to be changed to address these concerns. Until that 
happens I must regretfully oppose this legislation in its current form.

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate Mr. Eric Musser, President and Chief Operating Officer of 
Corning Incorporated, on the occasion of his well-earned retirement. 
For nearly four decades, Mr. Musser has exemplified steadfast 
leadership, technical excellence, and an unwavering commitment to 
innovation and service.
  Since joining Corning Incorporated in 1986 as a shift supervisor at 
the company&#x27;s optical fiber plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, Eric 
Musser has risen through the ranks, bringing stability, growth, and 
global perspective to one of the Nation&#x27;s most innovative companies. 
His deep operational expertise and visionary leadership have been 
instrumental in driving Corning&#x27;s success across its five Market-Access 
Platforms and international regions.
  As Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Musser has led efforts to enhance 
operational performance, strengthen Corning&#x27;s global footprint, and 
implement systems that drive long-term efficiency and growth. He 
championed key improvements in productivity and efficiency, 
institutionalized operational best practices, and built a strong 
foundation for future leaders. His efforts have helped Corning 
strengthen its market leadership and long-term competitiveness.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that this House join me in honoring Eric Musser 
for his exceptional contributions to Corning Incorporated and to 
American industry. We thank him for his years of service and leadership 
and wish him and his family all the best in this next chapter.

   RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day, a day dedicated 
to increasing public knowledge about PTSD, a complex mental health 
condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic 
event.
  Nearly eight million people in the United States are living with 
PTSD, many suffering and unaware of the resources available. Living 
with PTSD can have a significant impact on an individual&#x27;s daily life, 
and an awareness of one&#x27;s emotional wellbeing, including signs and 
symptoms such as avoidance, flashbacks, and hyper vigilance is 
essential to fostering healing and accessing support.
  Advancements have been made over the years to better understand and 
treat PTSD. Through research and lived experience, PTSD has been 
recognized as a natural response to overwhelming events. Community 
awareness, peer support, and destigmatizing mental health care are 
essential to curating healing spaces. Education and training have 
equipped community members throughout the globe to be able to identify 
and respond to individuals suffering from PTSD with sensitivity and 
deep understanding.
  To day, we recognize National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
Awareness Day and the strides made by countless individuals and those 
who walk alongside them with love and support. Let this day serve as a 
reminder that help is available, not only through treatment but 
empathy, education and advocacy. Each year of acknowledgement helps to 
break down stigma and build caring environments for future generations 
and we are all the better for it.

                  REMEMBERING MRS. BRUNETTE WASHINGTON

                                 ______

                        Wednesday, July 16, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Mrs. Brunette Washington, a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and 
community member whose love, compassion, and devotion to her family and 
Western New York inspired all who knew her. Mrs. Washington passed away 
this month at the age of 111, having lived a fulfilling and rewarding 
life.
  Mrs. Washington was born on June 7, 1914, in Forkland, Alabama, and 
later moved to Lackawanna, New York, where she shared more than seven 
decades with her husband, Mr. James Washington. Together, the loving 
couple became parents to Israel, Willie (Lott), Marvis (Washington), 
and Winona (Kirkland).
  She is survived by many who loved her, including five grandchildren, 
nine great-grandchildren, eleven great-great grandchildren, and one 
great-great-great grandchild. Her love for her family and community 
left a lasting impact on all who crossed her path.
  Respectfully known as ``Mother Washington&#x27;&#x27; to her congregation at 
Macedonia Baptist Church, where she served as a Sunday school teacher, 
member of the nurses guild, and President of the Mission Society, she 
is remembered for ministering to the youth, helping those in need, and 
as a joyful singer for the Lord in the church&#x27;s choir.
  Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Brunette Washington lived a life of devotion to her 
family, her community, and her faith. Her unwavering commitment to 
those she loved and her compassion towards others made a profound 
impact on all who knew her. Mrs. Washington was a woman who believed in 
the importance of family above all else and worked tirelessly to 
support those around her. Her kindness, loyalty, and warmth will 
forever be remembered. Let us continue to honor her legacy by carrying 
forward the values she lived by: respect, service, and above all, love.
