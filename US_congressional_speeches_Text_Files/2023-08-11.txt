             CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF ALICE DAVIS

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Alice Davis, a tenacious 
servant/leader, astute fundraiser and compassionate and committed 
humanitarian who is turning 100 this week.
  A fourth generation Washingtonian, Alice Tompkins Davis is a product 
of the District of Columbia public school system, whose love of 
mathematics led to a Bachelor of Science degree from Miner Teachers 
College (now the University of the District of Columbia) in 1943 and 
graduate studies in mathematics at Catholic University. This career 
path of critical thinking helped refine her methodical, detail-oriented 
intellect and provided a background for organized planning and 
execution abilities--all of which make her an invaluable leader and 
team player on several local and national organization and association 
boards and committees. It is these specific talents and skills that 
served her well for decades and served the Howard University Medical 
Alumni Association (HUMAA) so well from 1982 to 1996 in her role as 
Executive Director.
  While Alice Tompkins grew up in the segregated town of the District 
of Columbia, she was never handicapped by race or sex. She was a 20th 
century leader in women&#x27;s rights, civil rights, children&#x27;s rights, 
mental health and housing, by example. In recognition of her talents, 
she was chosen for several mayoral appointments including member on the 
DC Commission for Women, the DC Health Plan, State Health Coordinating 
Committee (SHCC) and 8 years on the District of Columbia Lottery and 
Charitable Games Board. Her extensive leadership roles on the national 
and local levels for Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. began in 1945. 
One of her most significant achievements was the establishment of the 
Delta Housing Corporation of Washington, D.C. in 1977. This landmark 
development project, with HUD funding of over $6.5 million, built 
affordable housing. It was the first of its kind awarded to a Black 
women&#x27;s organization. To date, it has continued as an ongoing legacy.
  As a member since 1948 and a past president of the Auxiliary to the 
National Medical Association, her work in health education and 
volunteer services set a national standard as did her National Youth 
Forum leadership in conjunction with the March of Dimes. Her service to 
the D.C. Mental Health Association began in 1967 with policy 
development and lobbying and being a media spokesperson and program 
coordinator. Her service contribution awards, spanning over 60 years, 
are numerous.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to wish Alice 
Tompkins Davis a happy 100th birthday, in recognition of her 
distinguished life of service to others.

                          ____________________

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Consulate 
General of Ukraine in Houston, and all the people of Ukraine, on their 
Independence Day. The spirit of Ukraine is an inspiration to all 
freedom loving peoples in the world. The rights that we so often take 
for granted are under constant threat from dictators like Vladimir 
Putin. There is no stronger example of what it takes to stand up for 
liberty in the world today than the struggle fought every day in 
Ukraine.
  I take a special pride in offering this congratulations as Texans and 
Ukrainians are most assuredly kindred spirits. In a book he wrote after 
a 1946 trip to the Soviet Union, the late John Fischer concluded that 
Ukrainians are ``Texans in Fur Hats.&#x27;&#x27; It&#x27;s no surprise that a 
significant portion of the first wave of Ukrainian immigrants to the 
United States settled in Texas. Our histories are intertwined, as is 
our love of liberty. Glory to Ukraine (Slava Ukraini).

HONORING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the 70th anniversary of the U.S. Small Business 
Administration (SBA). Over the last seven decades, the U.S. Small 
Business Administration has played a vital role in supporting and 
empowering small businesses. Providing entrepreneurs important guidance 
on financial products, the SBA has proven to be an invaluable resource.
  Small businesses and their employees drive growth and innovation and 
play an essential role in the American economy. In the United States, 
there are over 33 million small businesses that employ approximately 
61.7 million Americans. In the past 28 years, these businesses have 
created 17.3 million net new jobs, which accounts for 62.7 percent of 
jobs created since 1995.
  The Lower Rio Grande Valley District of the U.S. Small Business 
Administration serves 14 counties in south Texas. In 2020, over 179,000 
jobs were supported by approximately 10,000 establishments in the 34th 
Congressional District alone. Through their various programs and 
initiatives, the SBA has provided small businesses access to capital, 
Federal contracting certifications and opportunities, and disaster 
recovery.
  Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed the U.S. Small Business Administration 
open doors for and provide a lifeline to small business owners across 
south Texas and it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge this agency&#x27;s 
invaluable contributions to our region and country.

            HONORING THE LIFE OF DOROTHY DIANA (ROZA) DECKER

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today we gather to honor the life of Dorothy 
Diana (Roza) Decker, a passionate advocate for early childhood 
education and a beacon of dedication within our community. Diana&#x27;s 
lifelong commitment to education has left an indelible mark on the 
lives of countless individuals. She peacefully passed away at her 
Fresno home on July 23, 2023, leaving behind a legacy of compassion, 
determination, and lasting influence.
  Born on November 11, 1942, in Hanford, California, Diana&#x27;s journey 
began on a dairy farm in Easton, California, surrounded by the love of 
her parents and five brothers. Her heart radiated with a genuine 
concern for others from an early age, a trait that would define her 
entire life. Diana attended Washington Union High School, excelling 
academically, and serving as the editor of the school&#x27;s newspaper, a 
role that foreshadowed her lifelong dedication to sharing stories and 
voices.
  Diana&#x27;s path intertwined with that of her soulmate, Mike Decker, in 
1963. Their story unfolded with a sense of fate, and on July 4, 1964, 
they embarked on a journey of love that spanned 53 remarkable years. 
Together, they raised a family and built a legacy of love, resilience, 
and unwavering commitment to one another.
  Diana&#x27;s passion for early childhood education was both a vocation and 
a calling. For over 30 years, she poured her heart and soul into 
advocating for the youngest members of our society. Her contributions 
to the Central California Association of Young Children were 
immeasurable, embodying her dedication through roles such as Chapter 
President, Community Outreach advocate, Governing Board member, and was 
the very first recipient of the Fansler Institute ECE Leader of the 
Year award for her contributions to the educational community. She 
continued to shine her light at the state level, serving as a Central 
California representative on the State board of the California 
Association for the Education of Young Children, leaving an indelible 
mark on the landscape of childhood education across the State.
  Diana&#x27;s impact extended to her teaching career, empowering children, 
and adults with her wisdom. Her role as a special education teacher for 
Central Unified and later as a Special Education Specialist Lead for 
the Merced County Office of Education, CPIN, exemplified her dedication 
to fostering growth and potential in every individual. Her compassion 
radiated not only in her professional endeavors but also within her 
family. As a loving mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she 
left an indelible mark of love, unity, and boundless support.
  As we mourn Diana&#x27;s physical absence, we find solace in the beautiful 
memories and legacy of love she has gifted us. Her life&#x27;s tapestry is 
woven with threads of compassion, kindness, and resilience, reminding 
us that the impact of a single life, lived with purpose, can reach far 
beyond the confines of time. Diana is survived by her three children: 
Timothy John Decker of Pagosa Springs, Colorado; Katie Marie Decker and 
Scott Arthur Decker, both Fresno, California and daughter-in-law Marie 
Estrada Decker. Her legacy also includes three grandchildren: Michael 
Anthony Hill, Jadyn Decker Garrett, and Nicho Decker, as well as a 
great-granddaughter, Neelia Grace Hill. She is also survived by her 
brothers Gene Roza and his wife, Marylou Roza; Robert Roza and his 
wife, Gail Roza; and Franklin Roza. Numerous cousins, including myself, 
nieces, and nephews also cherish her memory.
  May we honor Diana&#x27;s memory by carrying forward her torch of 
compassion, nurturing the dreams of our youth, and supporting one 
another with the unwavering devotion she showed throughout her 
remarkable journey.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring the 
legacy of Dorothy Diana (Roza) Decker, a dedicated educator whose 
commitment to early childhood education has profoundly shaped the lives 
of many. Her contributions will continue to inspire generations, 
fostering a love for learning and education.

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, today we gather to honor the remarkable 
contributions and career of Lee Ann Eager, a dedicated leader who has 
played a pivotal role in the economic development and growth of Fresno 
County. As she embarks on a new chapter in her life, retiring from her

demonstrated exemplary leadership in guiding economic development and 
attracting investments to the region. Her visionary approach and 
strategic thinking allowed the EDC to expand its influence beyond the 
local sphere, engaging stakeholders from the private, public,

  Lee Ann&#x27;s dedication to supporting families in her community was 
evident throughout her career. Before joining the EDC, she championed 
the cause of survivors of sexual violence as the Executive Director of 
the Rape Counseling Services of Fresno, empowering and advocating for 
those in need. Her passion for making a positive impact on the lives of 
others continued in her work at the EDC,

where she tirelessly focused on creating opportunities for employers, 
workers, and job seekers to partake in the region&#x27;s economic growth.

exemplify her commitment to prioritizing programs and funding that 
uplift families throughout the Central Valley. Additionally, her

showcases her dedication to public policy initiatives that benefit the 
entire community.
  Lee Ann&#x27;s passion for infrastructure development and workforce 
empowerment led her to work diligently on the High-Speed Rail project 
for over 14 years. Her efforts in assisting local businesses impacted 
by the project and advocating for workforce development across 
California demonstrate her dedication to creating inclusive economic 
opportunities.
  Her commitment to Fresno County extended to numerous local boards, 
including the Mayor&#x27;s Advisory Council, Fresno State Transportation 
Institute, Fresno State&#x27;s Lyles College of Engineering, and Five Cities 
JPA, among others. Through her active engagement with these 
organizations, Lee Ann contributed significantly to the growth and 
prosperity of the region.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, ADMIRAL MIKE 
                                 GILDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOE COURTNEY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the diligent and 
honorable service of Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday. On 
August 14, Admiral Gilday is slated to retire from his four-year term 
as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 32nd Chief of Naval Operations, and it is more than 
fitting that this chamber take a moment to recognize his extraordinary 
record leading our Nation&#x27;s Navy.
  A New England native hailing from Massachusetts, Mike Gilday was 
raised in a family with a strong Navy tradition. His innate 
intelligence, his patriotism and his leadership qualities stood out at 
an early age, foreshadowing a promising career as a naval officer. Upon 
graduating high school, he received a congressional nomination to the 
U.S. Naval Academy, and after graduation was commissioned as a Surface 
Warfare Officer in 1985. During his career he continued his passion for 
learning and obtained an MPA from the Harvard Kennedy School and an MS 
from the National War College.
  Admiral Gilday&#x27;s record at sea is impressive. He commanded the 
Destroyers USS Higgins and USS Benfold, was Commodore of Destroyer 
Squadron 7, and Commander of Carrier Strike Group 8. As Vice Admiral, 
he was the fourth commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command developing and 
enhancing the Navy&#x27;s information network operations, offensive and 
defensive cyberspace operations, space operations and signals 
intelligence. In the 21st century, proficiency in cyber command--
something which didn&#x27;t exist until recently, provides an immense 
benefit to naval readiness. Admiral Gilday is the first to bring skill 
to the CNO position.
  Ashore he served our Nation with distinction during a remarkable 
career. He completed several tours as a staff officer working for the 
Chief of Naval Operations and the Vice Chief of Naval Operations. He 
served as the executive assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and naval aide to the President.
  His commitment to our allies and partners were not only reflected 
during his work as the Chief of Naval Operations, but during his 
distinguished service as the director of operations for NATO&#x27;s Joint 
Force Command Lisbon and as Chief of Staff for Naval Striking and 
Support Forces NATO.
  Appointed to the role of Chief of Naval Operations in August 2019, 
Admiral Gilday has, in conjunction with the Congress&#x27;s constitutional 
mandate in Article One, Section 8 ``To provide and maintain a Navy&#x27;&#x27;, 
done outstanding work to keep our fleet relevant and oriented to 
challenges across the globe. Equipped with his striking educational 
background, as well as his history of deployments and command, his 
competent service as the head of naval operations has come to no 
surprise. It speaks volumes that he was the first three-star admiral to 
be appointed, to the position of Chief of Naval Operations in nearly 
half a century.
  Each of his prior missions have influenced a modernized national 
security perspective within him, and by extension from the top of the 
U.S. Navy down. As our Nation has shifted emphasis of our security 
strategy toward the Indo-Pacific region over the last decade-plus, 
Admiral Gilday has been a pioneer in adapting cyber preparedness and 
how best to prepare for and respond to competition or challenges to our 
collective freedom of the seas. He has been a steady presence in 
touring our Nation&#x27;s industrial base capabilities, testifying to the 
U.S. Navy&#x27;s needs before the House Armed Services Committee and a 
particular spokesperson in successfully advancing the cutting-edge 
vision of the AUKUS alliance.
  Mr. Speaker, as both Ranking Member and Chair of the House Armed 
Services&#x27; Seapower Projection Forces Subcommittee, I have had a front 
row seat to view his tenure. It was not an easy time, contending with 
an unstable budget environment, historic turnover in the Office of 
Secretary of the Navy from 2017 until 2020, and a global pandemic. 
Through it all, he maintained a steady hand on the helm of our fleet 
and the marine corps. Overcoming adversity is I believe the sternest 
test of leadership, and in my opinion, Admiral Gilday passed that test 
with flying colors. The weightiness of his sea legs will be incredibly 
difficult to replace, but we will welcome the new perspective brought 
on by the next Chief of Naval Operations. As Admiral Mike Gilday enters 
this new era of retirement with his wife, Linda, I ask that my 
colleagues in the House, and particularly those who serve on the House 
Armed Services Committee, to join me in recognizing his life of service 
to the Navy and the United States.

                   RECOGNIZING PASTOR EDDIE WILLIAMS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RASHIDA TLAIB

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Eddie 
Williams for his 17 years of service to the congregation at Lakeridge 
Ministries Church of God in Christ.
  Lakeridge Village Ministries was founded on the principle of 
uplifting people from all walks of life in spirituality and that the 
gift of spirituality is not limited to clergy. Pastor Williams has 
sought to lead his flock under that guidance, fostering a true sense of 
community and caring for the most vulnerable. In addition to his work 
in ministry, Pastor Williams has sought to expand resources and options 
for people suffering from the pain of addiction and mental illness. His 
work at Lakeridge Village has accomplished so much in fighting the 
stigma around mental health issues and connecting those struggling with 
substance abuse to the assistance they need. In short Pastor Williams 
has performed outstanding service to the community through his ministry 
and charitable work.

  Please join me in tribute to Pastor Eddie Williams in celebration of 
his 17 years in spiritual service to Lakeridge Ministries Church of God 
in Christ.

         RECOGNIZING THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MARCHING CENTURIONS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MIKE GARCIA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. MIKE GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and congratulate Saugus High School&#x27;s 2022-2023 Marching Centurions for 
their selection to represent California&#x27;s 27th Congressional District 
in the National Memorial Day Parade held in our Nation&#x27;s capital. Their 
designation as a distinguished participant in this year&#x27;s festivities 
is a testament to not only their performative excellence, but their 
resilience through several years of challenges from which they have 
emerged stronger than ever.
  It is important to recognize that this distinction is one that very 
few marching bands and color guards across the United States have the 
privilege of touting, and it is certainly one that is earned rather 
than given. For years leading up to their participation in the National 
Memorial Day Parade, the Marching Centurions of Saugus High School have 
distinguished themselves as a benchmark of virtuosity and dedication to 
craft. Time and time again, students throughout the years have

[[Page E773]]

represented their fellow classmates with unmatched pride and skill and 
it is heartening to see this program be rewarded with such an honor.
  I also want to pay special recognition to the members who graduated 
with the Class of 2023. Since they began high school in 2019, their 
graduating class has faced a gauntlet of trials and tribulations that 
many of their contemporaries or even most adults have not. After the 
tragic shooting in November of 2019, they were immediately confronted 
with the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns, and virtual learning which 
forced them to press on with rehearsals over Zoom. These challenges 
were of course coupled with the typical obstacles a teenager faces when 
navigating high school: homework, crushes, college applications, and 
anxiety about the future. As their representative in the halls of 
Congress, I could not be prouder of their resilience in the face of the 
impossible, and the manner in which they relied on each other to 
overcome the odds.
  Once again, I want to extend my sincerest congratulations to the 
Marching Centurions for this great honor that they had to commemorate 
our Nation&#x27;s heroes who have been killed in the defense of freedom for 
Memorial Day. As a Saugus alumnus myself, my heart swelled with pride 
seeing these students clad in blue and silver marching along the 
streets of Washington to honor our great country.

            RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF COLLIN MICHAEL MORRISON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PAUL A. GOSAR

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Collin 
Michael Morrison, devoted American patriot and late President/CEO of 
LionHeart Security Services in Tempe, Arizona.
  Born at a British military base in Singapore, Michael was the son of 
Scottish U.S. Army servicemembers. He spent his childhood in the United 
Kingdom and Southeast Asia where his father worked in intelligence.
  After moving to the United States, Michael&#x27;s core values in teamwork 
and equal justice led him to serve in both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army, 
in the Monterey County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, and later in international 
security.
  Notably, his international work landed him at U.S. embassies in 
Africa, including roles as a Project Manager for security forces in 
Guinea, West Africa, and as a security consultant for U.S. embassies in 
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, and Senegal. 
Here, he developed security training modules for local security forces 
assigned to these embassies.
  After 7 years in Africa, Michael returned to the United States to 
foster his continued sense of duty and create LionHeart Security 
Services in Arizona. As a business owner, he held an ``always can do 
and will do&#x27;&#x27; attitude with intense follow through. Every time the 
United States of America asked Michael to step up, you can guarantee he 
did.
  Beyond his accomplishments in the security industry, Michael was also 
a strong Conservative Republican. He was instrumental in drafting 
Congressional legislation to ensure U.S. Security Force project 
managers only report to U.S. Diplomatic Security Agents at U.S. 
embassies and consulates abroad. Similarly, he assisted in the Arizona 
House to pass a law to allow honorably discharged veterans to obtain a 
security guard I.D. card without a waiting period, thus enabling 
veterans to begin working as soon as their discharges were complete.
  He did not consider himself a hero, but an ordinary man in service of 
the nation he so loved. However, Michael&#x27;s greatest service was not in 
work, but in friendship. He lived by the following words:
     If you cannot stand, I will lift you.
     If you cannot walk, I will carry you.
     If you are blind, I will see for you.
     If you are mute, I will speak for you.
     If you are deaf, I will hear for you.
     If you are in fear, I will comfort you.
     If you are lost, I will guide you.
     If you are in danger, I will protect you.
     If you need courage, I will be brave for you.
     If you are confused, I will reassure you.
     If you cannot fight, I will defend you.
     And if you just need a friend, I am here for you.
  After contracting COVID-19, Michael spent his final days surrounded 
by friends, family, and his loving wife Mariam. He will be remembered 
as a man of courage, honor, and integrity. But most of all, a friend of 
mine.

            TRIBUTE TO THE WHITLEY HEIGHTS CIVIC ASSOCIATION

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th 
anniversary of the Whitley Heights Civic Association of Los Angeles, 
California.
  The Whitley Heights Civic Association, founded in 1923 as a garden 
club, has represented the members of the Whitley Heights neighborhood 
for 100 years. This notable achievement also earns the association the 
honor of being one of the longest continually operating civic 
associations in Los Angeles.
  The Whitley Heights community was established when major land 
developer Hobart Johnstone Whitley commissioned architect Arthur Barnes 
to begin the design and construction of a new Mediterranean-style 
neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills. The arched doorways and windows, 
iconic red-tiled roofs, and balconies were new to Los Angeles, inspired 
by Barnes&#x27; tour of the Mediterranean; in particular, Italy and its 
historic hillside towns. With many of the homes constructed between 
1918 and 1928, Whitley Heights was one of the first Hollywood 
developments. The style and aesthetic of the homes as well as the 
secluded hillside setting, attracted many prominent residents, 
including Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bette Davis, William 
Faulkner, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. In fact, the neighborhood&#x27;s design 
was so highly regarded that many exterior features became popular in 
other contemporary Los Angeles developments.
  Preservation of this iconic neighborhood has been a challenge in the 
decades since the initial development. Construction and alteration of 
the Hollywood Freeway divided the original development in the 1940&#x27;s 
and 1960&#x27;s, during which almost 50 homes were demolished. In the 
1980&#x27;s, after the demolition of a historic bungalow to make space for 
potential tract homes, actor Brian Moore, president of the civic 
association, began advocating for the historical preservation of 
Whitley Heights; this resulted in the neighborhood being added to the 
National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and later, into a Los 
Angeles Historical Preservation Overlay Zone. The civic association 
works with the residents, city agencies and elected officials to ensure 
the preservation of this beautiful neighborhood.
  It is an honor to recognize the Whitley Heights Civic Association for 
its commitment to preserving a historic neighborhood of Los Angeles, 
and I ask all Members to join me in congratulating this organization 
upon their centennial anniversary.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEVIN HERN

                              of oklahoma

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, August 11, 2023

  Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the end of World 
War II and the 78th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, otherwise 
known as V-J Day. The sacrifices of our World War II veterans paid for 
the end to what was one of the most horrific wars in human history.
  On this day in 1945, Japan signed the terms of surrender aboard the 
USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. This day marks the heroic triumph of 
American forces for the good of the whole world.
  Our World War II veterans may be dwindling in number, but their 
legacy as the greatest generation continues to grow. We must continue 
to esteem the truly incredible men and women who showed what a unified 
America can do to secure hope and liberty in the face of the most 
formidable adversary.
  I am grateful for the work of Frank Reisinger who recalls the 
celebrating of V-J Day in downtown Tulsa with his father as a young 
man. Frank has diligently held a celebration of this important day in 
Broken Arrow for the last 8 years so that his community understands the 
cost of war and the price of freedom.
  May we never forget that freedom is never free and that we are but 1 
generation away from losing what so many have fought and died to 
secure.
