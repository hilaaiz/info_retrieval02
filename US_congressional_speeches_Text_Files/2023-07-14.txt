           CONGRATULATING LIEUTENANT COMMANDER WESLEY BESSELL

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 14, 2023

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Wesley (Bob) Bessell 
for being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of his 
service and bravery in the U.S. Merchant Marines during World War II.
  Bob began his maritime career at the age of 15, as a member of the 
crew of the Corsair, an impressive private yacht owned by the J.P. 
Morgan family. Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard, 
and it was during his training that America entered World War II. Upon 
the completion of his training, Bob joined the U.S. Merchant Marines as 
an Able-Bodied Seaman.
  He served as a merchant mariner for more than 4\1/2\ years, which 
included a deployment on the SS West Hardaway when it was sunk by a 
torpedo from a German U-boat in 1942. After the U-boat attack, Bob and 
his fellow sailors took refuge in the small town of Porlamar on Isla de 
Margarita in Venezuela. The island&#x27;s inhabitants, though facing their 
own challenges, extended a warm welcome to the stranded crew, offering 
them shelter, sustenance and a renewed sense of hope. Bob forged bonds 
of friendship with the local community, transcending language barriers 
and cultural differences, and he recalls walking around the island like 
a rockstar, always surrounded by 10 or 20 smiling faces.
  In 1943, Bob completed Officer Candidate School and rose to the rank 
of a lieutenant commander. It was in the same year, on a mission to 
deliver documents in Liverpool, England, that Bob met Susan, the 
British love

[[Page E676]]

of his life. Bob still describes their chance encounter in a rainstorm 
great detail. Amid heavy rain, Susan stood illuminated by single a beam 
of sunlight. For 3 years, the couple communicated through letters, 
finding peace in each other&#x27;s presence amid the chaos of war. 
Immediately after the war, Bob called Susan and proposed marriage. They 
were married in a Nissen hut outside the ruins of a bombed English 
church in 1946. They spent 72 wonderful years together and had three 
children. They now have 4 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren.
  Bob selflessly put his life on the on the line to defend America&#x27;s 
freedom during one of its most challenging periods. President Roosevelt 
famously referred to the Merchant Mariners&#x27; mission during World War II 
as ``the most difficult and dangerous transportation job ever 
undertaken.
  It is my humble privilege to present Bob with the highest honor 
bestowed by Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal. This award is 1 of 
numerous honors that Bob has received for his service, including the 
Atlantic War Zone Medal, the Merchant Marine Combat Bar with Silver 
Star device, and the World War II Victory Medal.
  I congratulate Lieutenant Commander Bessell, on this well-deserved 
recognition. A grateful Nation thanks him for his service.

              HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF NORMA VALLES

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MARC A. VEASEY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 14, 2023

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and honor the 
life of Ms. Norma Valles, a vocalist, businesswoman, advocate, and 
loving wife and mother from North Texas
  Norma Valles was born in 1969 in Dallas, Texas, and graduated from 
Grand Prairie High School in 1987, to then go on to pursue career and 
family. She married her husband Alfonso in 1989 and had 3 amazing 
children. Her family was the center of her life--she was an amazing 
mother that did whatever she could to be there for her children and 
husband at every moment of their lives.
  Aside from being an amazing mother and wife, Valles was also an 
accomplished vocalist. Known as the ``The Queen of Mariachi Music,&#x27;&#x27; 
she captured the attention of countless North Texas Fans, from singing 
National Anthem at a Mavericks or Texas Rangers game to singing at 
local weddings. Her amazing voice led her to showcase her skills in 
various productions. She was cast in leading roles in ``The King and 
I,&#x27;&#x27; as well as in independent productions like ``Fiestas de Mi 
Tierra&#x27;&#x27; and Spanish movies such as ``Yo Soy El Hijo del Michoacano.&#x27;&#x27; 
Her vocal skills also landed her numerous opportunities to record 
voice-overs and jingles for TV and Radio. She additionally hosted 
Channel 44&#x27;s ``Happy Sunday&#x27;s Variety Show&#x27;&#x27; and ``Salud Para Usted y 
Su Familia.&#x27;&#x27;
  Valles gave back to the community in numerous other ways. Norma&#x27;s 
vocals left such a deep impact that David Albert wanted to become her 
mentor. From that day on, they were a team that just kept on giving. 
David brought her into the studio, and they went on to record nine 
albums plus Si Se Puede CDS to help the Spanish community to learn 
English. He asked her to manage Casita Tex-Mex Bar &amp; Grill, which she 
later became the owner of and is still standing today. Casita Tex-Mex 
Bar &amp; Grill had a love for veterans--from welcoming the troops at DFW 
to now honoring veterans every First Tuesday of the month at Casita 
Tex-Mex. Valles also had worked at the Oak Cliff Chamber of Commerce 
and spent her life involved in various organizations, ranging from the 
Irving Hispanic Chamber, H100, North Dallas of Commerce, HWNT, Dallas 
St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade, Dia De Los Muertos and so many more. She also 
remodeled and fixed up homes across North Texas, later starting her own 
business and becoming General Contractor for her business NV 
Contractors
  Valles will be forever missed by loved ones. She blessed the lives of 
many and will continue to bless us with her music and businesses.

HONORING THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACKS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE&#x27;S 50TH 
                              ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY&#x27;&#x27; SCOTT

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 14, 2023

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
recognize the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice 
(NABCJ) on their 50th Anniversary.
  The mission of the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice 
is to act upon the needs, concerns, and contributions of African 
Americans and other people of color as they relate to the 
administration of equal justice. This milestone of NABCJ advancing 
justice for 50 years signifies decades of positive change and a 
commitment to criminal justice as a fundamental aspect of our 
democracy.
  At the heart of NABCJ is its dedicated members, who consist of 
criminal justice professionals including those in law enforcement, 
corrections, courts, social services&#x27;, academia as well as religious 
and community leaders. They work diligently to research relevant 
legislation and focus attention on improving law enforcement and our 
criminal justice system through evidence-based policies. Their strong 
commitment to respect the dignity of all humans contributes to the 
NABCJ&#x27;s rich history of excellence and integrity.
  The 400 Years African American History Commission, created by 
Congress in 2017, has been heavily engaged with NABCJ through 11 
student chapters of the organization at Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities. Additionally, the National Alliance of Faith and Justice, 
first formed as a committee of the NABCJ, was founded and has 
successfully grown over the last 20 years. The establishment of these 
relationships have helped pave the way for African Americans and other 
people of color to receive equal justice under the law.
  The National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice has a long 
history of promoting evidence-based strategies that more effectively 
address crime and keeping America&#x27;s communities safe. I was grateful 
for NABCJ&#x27;s support of my Youth Prison Reduction through Mentoring, 
Intervention, Support and Education (Youth PROMISE) Act, which I first 
introduced in 2007 to help communities develop and implement evidence-
based strategies to reduce youth violence and delinquency. Provisions 
of the Youth PROMISE Act were ultimately enacted in the Juvenile 
Justice Reform Act of 2018, and it would not have been possible without 
the work and support of organizations like NABCJ.
  Mr. Speaker, NABCJ embodies what it means to fight for ``liberty and 
justice for all.&#x27;&#x27; It is my pleasure to congratulate the National 
Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice on the many hard-fought 
battles won since its inception 50 years ago and wish the organization 
many more years of success.

                         Friday, July 14, 2023

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the 
lives of the Oddo brothers, 6 men who courageously served their country 
as naval seamen following the outbreak of WWII.
  Their father, Charles Oddo, was a Sicilian immigrant who settled in 
Bellevue, Ohio with his wife Mary. They raised their sons to 
acknowledge the prestige and privilege of being American citizens. 
Richard, William, Charles, Samuel, Carl, and James Oddo all faithfully 
served their nation, and are believed to be the largest set of siblings 
to serve in the U.S. Navy.
  Thankfully, all 6 brothers returned home safely to start their lives 
in their hometown after their honorable service, where the Oddo family 
still gathers today. Saturday, they will be honored with a plaque at 
the Dr. Jackson Commemorative Plaque Wall within the Navy memorial. 
More than 2 dozen family and friends will be in attendance to pay 
tribute to their heroism.
  Ohio salutes these exceptional men, who continued to serve their 
families, neighbors, and communities throughout their lives.

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 14, 2023

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding mentor, dedicated servant leader, faithful servant of God 
and dear friend of longstanding, the Reverend Dr. Gregory A. Sutton. 
Dr. Sutton will be honored for his 53 years of faithful service at 
Jackson Memorial Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on Sunday, July 
16, 2023, at 10:30 am.
  Dr. Sutton was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He was raised among great 
educators, philosophers, and theologians. Dr. Sutton was always 
concerned about the welfare of others and used his voice to speak out 
on pressing issues of the day. He began to preach the Gospel at the 
young age of 16. This would lay the blueprint for his ministry and his 
destiny--the boy, the preacher, the man, and the visionary.
  Dr. Sutton began preaching the Gospel while he was still in high 
school and accepted the calling to preach a growing church called 
Jackson Memorial at the age of 18, where he has pastored for 53 years. 
Through his leadership, the church has continued to expand its 
membership and physical footprint. Dr. Sutton has seen the expansion of 
the church&#x27;s membership to over 6,000 members and he has overseen the 
construction of 2 new edifices for the church. Dr. Sutton&#x27;s ministry is 
indeed a global ministry and reaches people where they are across the 
world.
  The scripture tells us in Proverbs, ``that the people perish where 
there is no vision.&#x27;&#x27; Dr. Sutton is indeed a visionary and has used his 
ministry to reach people beyond the church walls. He has dedicated 
himself to the awareness, protection, and spiritual development of 
youth. Dr. Sutton was the originator of the phrase, ``Stop the 
Violence, Save the Youth.&#x27;&#x27; Cementing his commitment to young people 
and their spiritual futures, Pastor Sutton was the first pastor in the 
Atlanta area to open his church for prayer for students before school. 
He also reaches out and incorporates the needs of his elderly 
parishioners in his ministry. Dr. Sutton has a complete ministry that 
attempts to reach many different groups for Christ to include those 
that are in prison, the homebound, the homeless, the low income and the 
disenfranchised. He uses his Weekly Television Broadcast, ``Now is the 
Time,&#x27;&#x27; to reach those who would not otherwise be reachable.
  Dr. George Washington Carver once said that ``How far you go in life 
depends on your being tender with the young; compassionate with the 
aged; sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and the 
strong, because someday in your life you will have been all of these.&#x27;&#x27; 
Dr. Sutton is acutely aware that for the Kingdom of God to be 
manifested in this world, it is imperative that people from all walks 
of life be brought into the fold and be made to feel that they matter 
and that Jesus Loves them. Dr. Sutton&#x27;s ministry is truly a Matthew 25 
type of ministry.
  Even amid his various ministerial duties, Dr. Sutton finds time to 
serve his community at large. It has been said that ``Service is the 
rent that we pay for the space that we occupy here on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; Dr. 
Sutton has paid his rent and he has paid it well. He serves on the 
board of directors of many social and civic organizations to include 
the Board of Ministers of Morehouse College.
  Reverend Dr. Gregory Sutton has achieved much in life, but none of it 
would have been possible without the grace of God and the love and 
support of this wife, First Lady Gail Sutton; his children, Theresa, 
Tony, Keisha, and

[[Page E677]]

LaQuay; his 3 grandchildren and other family members.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join my wife, Vivian, and I; along with the more than 765,000 people of 
Georgia&#x27;s Second Congressional District in honoring and commending the 
Reverend Dr. Gregory A. Sutton for 53 years of dedicated service to his 
God, Jackson Memorial Baptist Church and humankind. Moreover, we pray 
God&#x27;s continued blessings upon him, his ministry, and his family in the 
weeks, months, and years ahead.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DAVID G. VALADAO

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 14, 2023

  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. John Harris for 
his incredible contributions to the Central Valley and to wish him a 
very happy 80th birthday.
  A native of Five Points, Mr. Harris has dedicated his life to 
California&#x27;s agricultural industry. Following his graduation from 
Bullard High School, Mr. Harris earned a degree in Agricultural 
Production from the University of California, Davis and served for 2 
years as an artillery officer in the U.S. Army. Mr. Harris returned to 
his family farm where he would dedicate the next 5 decades to building 
Harris Farms into one of the largest agribusinesses in the nation. Mr. 
Harris and his family&#x27;s leadership in the agricultural industry spans 
more than 100 years--a true testament to their commitment to their work 
and community.
  After his father Jack Harris&#x27; passing in 1981, John Harris became the 
owner and Chief Executive Officer of Harris Farms. Under the leadership 
of his grandfather, father, and now Mr. Harris, Harris Farms has become 
a staple of the Central Valley. Under Mr. Harris&#x27; leadership, the 
family operation has grown to span over 17,000 acres and produces a 
wide variety of crops annually--including lettuce, onions, garlic, 
almonds, pistachios, wine grapes, cotton, and citrus. Perhaps the most 
well-known undertaking by Mr. Harris throughout the Central Valley is 
Harris Ranch Beef Company, California&#x27;s largest fed cattle processor 
that produces nearly 200 million pounds of beef a year.
  In addition to its impressive ranch and farming operations, Harris 
Farms has also become a popular destination for travelers and locals 
alike with its restaurant, butcher shop, and hotel. Mr. Harris is also 
an accomplished horse breeder. Harris Farms Horse Division has produced 
numerous champions including Eclipse Award Horses of the Year 
California Chrome and Tiznow. Harris Farms has raised and campaigned 
100s of top racehorses over the last 60 years. Mr. Harris has played at 
a most active role in the California and national racing scene, serving 
multiple terms as the Chairman of the California Thoroughbred Breeders 
Association, Chairman of the Bay Meadows Racing Association, as well as 
being on the California Horse Racing Board for multiple terms, being 
appointed by both Republican and Democratic Governors, and serving as 
board chair for several terms.
  He is also a member of The Jockey Club and has served as a Steward 
there. Mr. Harris represents the very best of the Central Valley. He 
has grown a small family operation into one of the largest farms not 
only in California but the nation--all while providing high-quality 
food products, creating thousands of jobs, and building a welcoming 
community center for Valley residents. Mr. Harris is also deeply 
dedicated to his philanthropic work, having supported critical 
organizations like the Boys and Girls Club, Boy Scouts of America, and 
Community Medical Centers for decades. His contributions to our 
community will have a lasting impact for generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives 
to join me in recognizing the tremendous contributions of Mr. John 
Harris to our Central Valley community and wishing him a happy 80th 
birthday.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 14, 2023

  Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to posthumously honor Mr. Robb 
Lally, a dedicated public servant and volunteer for more than 35 years.
  Robert (Robb) Lally entered the seminary at a young age and as a 
deacon, served in a Catholic Parish. After finishing seminary school, 
Mr. Lally continued to help and aid those in need through his work with 
the Franciscans at Arch Street, and later for the Salvation Army.
  In 1988, Robb Lally headed to San Diego to work with the founder of 
the Alpha Project, a non-profit human services organization that serves 
over 4,000 men, women and children daily. As director, he empowered 
individuals, families and communities by providing work, recovery and 
support services to those who were motivated to change their lives and 
achieve self-sufficiency. During his tenure, Robb was instrumental in 
the overall mission and growth of the organization and had assisted 
with over 1,000 apartment units that were preserved and created.
  On June 7, 2023, Robb&#x27;s life and legacy were honored at a Celebration 
of Life in San Diego, CA. On behalf of the residents of California&#x27;s 
52nd Congressional District, I would like to express my deepest 
condolences to the family of Robb Lally. His legacy is felt, and his 
presence will be greatly missed.
