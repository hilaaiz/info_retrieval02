      CELEBRATING DR. HANK HINE FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ARTS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KATHY CASTOR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Dr. 
Hank Hine, his remarkable achievements and the well-deserved 
recognition from Spain&#x27;s King, Felipe VI of the Order of Isabel la 
Catolica. As the Executive Director of The Dali Museum in St. 
Petersburg. Florida, Dr. Hine has not only enriched our community and 
cultural landscape, but also has forged international connections that 
highlight the artistic and cultural treasures we hold dear.
  Dr. Hine&#x27;s lifelong commitment to the arts and his exceptional 
stewardship of The Dali Museum have left an indelible mark on the 
cultural life of our community. The Dali Museum holds the largest 
collection of Salvador Dali&#x27;s artworks outside of Dali&#x27;s home country 
of Spain. Under his visionary leadership, the museum has become a 
beacon of creativity and inspiration, welcoming visitors from all 
corners of the globe to experience the masterpieces of Dali and other 
renowned artists.
  The recent honor bestowed upon Dr. Hine, the Order of Isabel la 
Catolica, is a testament to his dedication and tireless efforts in 
fostering cultural exchange and promoting the legacy of Salvador Dali, 
one of the most celebrated artists of all times. This recognition is 
one of the highest civilian honors Spain bestows, and it reflects the 
deep respect and admiration with which he is regarded not only in our 
local community but also on the international stage. Dr. Hine expressed 
his gratitude to the entire community in his acceptance address, 
recognizing all those who welcomed The Dali to St. Petersburg--the 
founders, staff, trustees, and volunteers whose embrace of the power of 
art propelled all the Museum&#x27;s achievements.
  Dr. Hine&#x27;s work transcends borders, enriching our understanding of 
art, culture and the human experience. His tireless commitment to 
fostering collaboration and understanding among different cultures and 
nations deserves our highest praise and gratitude.
  As we congratulate Dr. Hine on this prestigious recognition, we also 
express our gratitude for his continued contributions to the vibrant 
cultural tapestry of our community. His passion and leadership at The 
Dali Museum have made Tampa Bay a cultural hub and a destination for 
art enthusiasts worldwide.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and 
applauding Dr. Hank Hine for his outstanding achievements and for 
bringing the world of art and culture closet to our hearts and our 
community. Dr. Hine&#x27;s unwavering commitment to the arts has enhanced 
the lives of my community and his work will be celebrated by many 
generations. May his work continue to inspire and enrich us all.

 CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF WWII USMC VETERAN WILLIAM PAUL GOSCH

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor World War 
II Marine Corps veteran William P. Gosch as he celebrates his 100th 
birthday which is December 8th.
  William P. Gosch was born in North Tonawanda, New York, on December 
8th, 1923. While attending North Tonawanda High School, he showed 
academic prowess, earning a football scholarship to attend Niagara 
University. After graduating from high school in the Fall of 1941, 
William chose to forgo his scholarship and joined the Marine Corps. For 
two years, he served as a rifleman and military policeman in the 
infamous ``Carlson&#x27;s Raiders&#x27;&#x27; in the Eastern Pacific Theatre of World 
War II.
  William Gosch was an exemplary soldier. His unit was awarded a 
presidential citation for their heroism in capturing the Okinawa 
Prefecture, Japan. During his time as a Marine, he participated in 
action in Bougainville, Emirau Island, the St. Matthias Islands, Guam, 
and Okinawa. Following the Allied victory in World War II, William 
Gosch worked as a general manager in the Richardson Boat Company before 
spending time working in the costume jewelry business in Honolulu. 
After returning to Buffalo and settling down, his opportunity to 
dedicate more to the Buffalo community came in 2020 when he was 
instated as the temporary replacement for the 2nd Ward Alderwoman. 
Following this, William received the rare opportunity to collaborate 
with YouTube documentarian Rishi Sharma, where he promoted awareness of 
the remaining World War II veterans to an audience of over one million 
people.
  Today, I want to congratulate William on his 100th birthday and 
express my deep gratitude to William Paul Gosch for his service to our 
country and the Buffalo community. As William said in 2020, ``Buffalo 
is the greatest city in the world.&#x27;&#x27; it is a great city because of 
dedicated individuals such as William Paul Gosch.

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize 
Mike Budney, Manager of the Department of Energy&#x27;s Savannah River Site, 
on receiving a 2023 Presidential Rank Award (PRA).
  The PRA is one of the highest awards bestowed upon career senior 
executives by the President of the United States for making 
extraordinary and lasting achievements for their respective agencies.
  During his service at the Savannah River Site, Mike has overseen 
completion of the tank waste treatment system with the startup of the 
Salt Waste Processing Facility, spearheaded the Accelerated Basin De-
inventory project, saving taxpayers billions of dollars, and broken 
ground on the Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative, a facility that 
will bring government, industry, and academia together to develop and 
share advanced manufacturing technologies.
  Leading a workforce of over 12,000 government and contractor 
personnel to successfully accomplish these critical tasks demonstrates 
his commitment and service to this nation. This is in addition to his 
29 years of service in the U.S. Navy, including commanding officer of 
the USS Emory S. Land and the USS Pennsylvania.
  I am grateful to Mike for his service in helping to keep America 
strong and safe. Congratulations on receiving the Presidential Rank 
Award, an inspiration for what we can achieve as public servants.

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I want to honor 94-year-
old Korean War

[[Page E1131]]

veteran August V. Cosentino for his community accomplishments and life-
long dedication to America&#x27;s values.
  In 1951, young August Cosentino enlisted in the United States Air 
Force and was assigned to attend radio and radar school at Keesler Air 
Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, for one year of intensive training. 
Following his training, he was assigned to a forward operations outpost 
on the 38th parallel of the Korean peninsula, where he aided in 
directing advanced bombing missions in North Korea.
  After the Korean War, August Cosentino married the love of his life, 
Martha, and together they raised three children: Cindy, Ralph, and 
David, before Martha passed away on their 59th anniversary in 2012. To 
support his family through a growing America, August worked in the 
sales business before forming his own company--August Cosentino 
Enterprises, where they supplied the automotive industry with custom 
made parts.
  The Buffalo community played a large part in Mr. Cosentino&#x27;s life. 
August served as the president of Kenmore Rotary, where he tirelessly 
exemplified their motto of ``Service Above Self.&#x27;&#x27; As a talented 
musician, August can play the piano, accordion, and stand-up bass. He 
has played in several military bands since 1951 and is well known in 
the Western New York music community. Mr. Cosentino still plays stand-
up bass weekly in the choir at the Newman Center mass.
  I am excited to thank the guest of honor, veteran August V. 
Cosentino, for his service. Mr. Cosentino served our country 70 years 
ago and our grateful community since then, and I hope for many more 
bright years to come.

                   HONORING GEORGINA ``GINA&#x27;&#x27; CARDONA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RITCHIE TORRES

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, Georgina Cardona, affectionately 
known as Gina, was a woman of extraordinary kindness and caring, and 
left this world at the young age of 95. Her constant commitment to 
community and family formed the pillars for who she was in life. Gina 
moved into our community in the winter of 1952 from The Island of 
Puerto Rico with her husband Eliseo and only son Aureo. The three lived 
in a rooming house owned by the Rivera family, this is where she came 
to love the South Bronx and all those who lived there with her, 
including her beloved ``Bronx Bombers&#x27;&#x27;.
  After settling in, Gina continued her dedication to service of others 
by graduating with honors from the Helena Fuld School of Nursing. She 
started her career at Hunts Point Hospital as a surgical nurse, then 
worked at the Hospital for Joint Diseases until her retirement 40 years 
later. During her years in healthcare, she was instrumental in 
groundbreaking medical procedures and became a highly respected leader 
in the industry.
  While tirelessly working to improve the health of her fellow 
community members, she also fought for the Bronx we see today. Her 
political activism was integral in rebuilding the South Bronx. Gina 
always found the time and energy to campaign, mobilize, and organize 
her fellow community members to make lasting, positive changes for the 
South Bronx. Her passion for service and change was instilled in her 
family, especially her son and granddaughter who continue her legacy of 
love and community. She was as proud of her civic engagement as I am 
inspired by it.
  A beacon of strength, Gina was the Matriarch of her beloved family. 
Like many in her generation, she sent much of her hard-earned money to 
help her mother and sisters in Puerto Rico. Ultimately, she helped to 
settle them in the South Bronx. Gina continued to bring her family 
together by helping to move her aunt and younger cousins to Brooklyn. 
Gina&#x27;s commitment to her family is exemplified by these acts of 
selflessness.
  While the Bronx became Gina&#x27;s new home she never forgot where she 
came from. She would go back to Puerto Rico annually to see her aunt, 
uncle, and cousins. She would celebrate Puerto Rican heritage month 
with her brother and his family every year in Connecticut. She also 
made sure to teach her family in New York to appreciate and learn their 
history and culture. She did this through language, tradition, food. 
music, and celebrations. She embraced and loved her family with her 
entire heart. She will be sorely missed.
  I want to recognize her truly amazing impact on our community and 
anyone who knew her. Gina was a healer through and through. From saving 
lives as a nurse to helping rebuild her community to taking care of her 
family, she always worked to heal those around her. In the words of 
Gina&#x27;s only Granddaughter Ralina, she left behind a legacy of family 
and love, not in words but in her deeds.

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service 
of Butte County resident, Casey Corin Hatcher, who passed away in the 
early morning of November 5, 2023, at the young age of 43. She was 
surrounded by her sister, mother, and two lifelong friends.
  Casey was born on February 26, 1980, in Auburn, California to her 
parents Michelle and Tom Hatcher. When she arrived, she was welcomed by 
her big sister Kelci Hatcher who became her lifelong treasure. She was 
inquisitive and had a head for planning, directing and problem-solving 
early in her development. She moved to Chico to attend college in 1999, 
graduating, from California State University (CSU), Chico with a 
Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with an emphasis in 
marketing.
  Casey began her professional career with a management consulting firm 
focused on assisting small businesses. She assisted over 60 in total 
during her tenure. The hands-on work with these businesses provided her 
with a solid foundation for continuing her work in economic 
development.
  In 2011, Casey joined Butte County Administration as a member of its 
economic and community development unit, where she began her enduring 
advocacy for the Butte County community that she served with dedication 
for the remainder of her life.
  Casey worked on a variety of community development projects early in 
her career with the County including implementation of disaster 
recovery assistance for homeowners affected by the 2008 wildfires in 
Butte County. Due to her stellar work, she was promoted to Economic 
Development Manager in 2016. She returned to CSU, Chico and received 
her Master&#x27;s Degree in Public Administration in 2017.
  Casey served in the County&#x27;s Emergency Operation Center during many 
activations including the Oroville Dam Spillway Incident, the Wall, 
Ponderosa, and La Porte/Cherokee fires in 2017, the Camp Fire, the 2020 
North Complex Fire, and the 2021 Dixie Fire. She worked countless hours 
supporting the response and recovery to these tragedies in Butte 
County. She never wavered, faltered. or tired of her dedication to 
serving the people of Butte County.
  Ultimately. she was promoted to Deputy Chief Administrative Officer 
and assigned to ``lead&#x27;&#x27; disaster recovery organizing County staff, 
advocating with state and federal agencies, and helping rebuild the 
community for which she cared so deeply.
  Additionally, in October 2021, Casey was asked to testify before a 
congressional committee on disaster recovery where she was provided a 
national platform to advocate for disaster recovery. The systems Casey 
put into place are used today as a model by communities experiencing 
catastrophic disasters, including most recently by the State of Hawaii 
in their response to the Lahaina Wildfire in Maui.
  Casey was a rock; she was a role model; she was a moral compass. She 
was encouraging, challenging, motivating, but supportive. Her family, 
friends, colleagues, and beloved community will cherish her for the 
rest of the days of their lives.

  INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO DESIGNATE THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AS AN 
                            EMPOWERMENT ZONE

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today. I introduce a bill that would 
designate certain areas of the District of Columbia as empowerment 
zones. This bill would effectively reauthorize many of the unique 
federal tax incentives for business investment in D.C. that expired in 
2011. D.C.&#x27;s downtown, which has been the economic engine of the city, 
has been particularly hard hit by the increase in remote and hybrid 
work since the COVID-19 pandemic. making this bill especially 
important.
  In 1993, Congress created the national empowerment zone program to 
encourage investment in low-income communities and delegated to federal 
agencies the authority to designate communities as empowerment zones. 
D.C. was not among those so designated. However. in 1997. working 
primarily with Republicans in Congress, I created federal tax 
incentives for investment in D.C. by businesses and individuals. The 
business incentives were similar to, but more generous than, those 
available under the national empowerment zone program. I got the D.C. 
incentives reauthorized regularly until 2011, when Congress refused to 
extend the D.C. incentives. At the same time, Congress extended the 
national empowerment zone program, and the program was last extended 
through 2025. Under my bill, low-income neighborhoods in D.C. would be 
treated as empowerment zones as long as the national empowerment zone 
program remains in effect.
  Congress has recognized that the benefits of tax incentives for 
investment in economically distressed communities outweigh the costs, 
as it has continuously extended the national empowerment zone program. 
The tax incentives for D.C. were the only tax incentives for a big city 
that were not extended, even though they were initially created by 
Republicans, with the help of several Democrats.
  The expiration of the tax incentives for D.C. was tragically timed, 
as the low-income parts of D.C., which needed the incentives most, were 
ready for revitalization. As we work to revitalize downtown D.C. and 
Wards 5, 7 and 8, the need for these incentives for D.C. is of 
paramount importance. The tax incentives for D.C. were effective and 
their costs were de minimis.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

rightly recognizes a commitment to academic excellence. Mr. Speaker, it 
is a privilege to recognize Luis&#x27; many accomplishments.

  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest 
gratitude for the outstanding service and unwavering dedication of Andy 
Flick, who served as the Executive Director of the New Democrat 
Coalition. During my time as Chair of the New Dems, his tireless 
efforts were instrumental in advancing our shared vision for pragmatic 
and innovative solutions to the challenges facing our nation. From the 
intricacies of policy research to the dynamic coordination required in 
the Coalition&#x27;s daily operations, his contributions have truly made a 
lasting impact.
  Andy&#x27;s commitment to fostering bipartisan collaboration and ability 
to navigate the complex landscape of Capitol Hill have not gone 
unnoticed, and now he serves as the Director of Legislative Affairs for 
the Vice President. His strategic insights and meticulous attention to 
detail were invaluable assets to our team. As we continue to strive for 
a more effective and efficient government, I want to take this moment 
to recognize and thank Andy for his exemplary service.
  The New Democrat Coalition and I are profoundly grateful for Andy&#x27;s 
hard work, and I am confident that his future endeavors will reflect 
the same level of excellence he brought to our team. I wish Andy the 
best of luck in all his future endeavors and thank him for his 
outstanding service.

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mary Ellen 
Stone for her many years of service for the King County Sexual Assault 
Resource Center (KCSARC) and congratulate her on her retirement as the 
Executive Director.
  Mary Ellen has served as a steadfast advocate for survivors of sexual 
assault over the past 44 years throughout King County and Washington 
State. She has been a visionary leader in changing the landscape of 
sexual assault services including prevention, education, and victim 
advocacy. She was influential in establishing the state&#x27;s first 
accreditation process for sexual assault providers, professionalizing 
service delivery and ensuring core services to be accessible; and 
publishing ``He Told Me Not to Tell,&#x27;&#x27; one of the first educational 
pieces in the nation for parents to talk with their children about 
sexual assault. As a result, KCSARC is nationally recognized for its 
effective and innovative services.
  Mary Ellen has shared her time and expertise in many ways to better 
inform systems and communities about the needs of victims. This 
includes serving on the Seattle Archdiocese Review Board, Mental 
Illness Drug Dependence Oversight Board, Seattle Chief of Police Search 
committees, Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, Sex 
Offender Management Committee, Women&#x27;s Funding Alliance, and Municipal 
League Seattle-King County. My staff and I have had the privilege of 
working with Mary Ellen on multiple occasions. Through her productive 
relationships with several elected officials, Mary Ellen has helped the 
KCSARC gain exposure at both the state and federal level. Her passion, 
tenacity and leadership have shaped KCSARC into the strong, vibrant 
nonprofit it is today.

  Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank Mary Ellen Stone for her tireless work 
and contributions to the community, and I wish her a happy retirement.

 RECOGNIZING MICHAEL MITROKA&#x27;S 100TH BIRTHDAY AND SERVICE TO OUR NATION

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Michael Mitroka, 
a longtime resident of Southgate, MI and veteran of the Second World 
War, on the occasion of his 100th birthday. His service to our country 
is worthy of commendation.
  Born on November 20, 1923, Michael enlisted in the Army as a Private 
in May of 1943. Over the next two and a half years of service he would 
traverse the Pacific, seeing combat in places like New Guinea and the 
Philippines. The Japanese conquest of the Philippines just a couple of 
years earlier was one of the worst military defeats in U.S. military 
history, and the retaking of the islands, though sure to be a long and 
hard affair, was a point of pride for General MacArthur and the Army. 
By the time Michael left the Army as a Sergeant in December of 1945, he 
had earned the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, a good conduct medal, a 
purple heart, and two bronze stars, awarded for ``heroic or meritorious 
service in a combat zone.&#x27;&#x27;
  Michael carried on his service after the war by working in his local 
school district. He retired in 1985 as the Supervisor of Maintenance, 
Custodial, and Transportation after 35 years with the Southgate School 
District. Michael married his wife, Rosemary, just a few weeks before 
his discharge from the Army in 1945. Though Rosemary passed away in 
1994, her legacy carries on in their two sons, Paul and Michael Jr., 
three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Still an active 
member of his current and former community, Michael is a member of St. 
Aloysius-Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Royaltown, IL, the American 
Legion Post 975 in Dowell, IL, and the Knights of Columbus Council Post 
3965 in Southgate, MI.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
100th birthday of Michael Mitroka. A veteran who served our country 
with honor and bravery during our darkest hours eighty years ago, he 
spent the last eight decades continuing that service within his local 
community and uplifting those around him. As we celebrate the milestone 
of a centennial, Michael should know that he is appreciated and valued 
by his family, friends, community, and nation. We thank him for his 
service, and wish him a 101st year filled with laughter, love, and many 
blessings. I thank Michael.

                       Tuesday, November 28, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to recognize 
this year&#x27;s

[[Page E1133]]

Catherine McAuley Distinguished Alumnae Honoree at Mount Mercy Academy, 
Meghan Crotty Quinn. For over a century, Mount Mercy Academy has been a 
beacon of light and an indispensable institution within our community. 
With a unique focus on academic excellence, women&#x27;s leadership, and a 
commitment to building a just society, it is only proper to commend the 
alumni who have contributed to this much-deserved reputation.
  A proud South Buffalo resident, Meghan and her husband Kevin Quinn 
are the proud parents of Kiera (Mount Mercy Academy, Class of 2027), 
son Rory and daughter Colleen. Meghan is the daughter of Anita Durkin 
Crotty (Mount Mercy Academy Class of 1963) and Patrick Crotty. Meghan 
is a business and community leader. She graduated from John Carroll 
University in 2007 and earned the title of Certified Public Accountant 
shortly thereafter. Meghan&#x27;s rise in the banking industry has been 
rapid; after a stint with M&amp;T Bank, she now serves as a Senior Vice 
President in the Commercial Banking division at HSBC Bank. She has 
twice been recognized by her peers as a top 100 performer in United 
States commercial banking and is a recipient of the Irish Echo&#x27;s 40 
Under 40 Award in 2021. Meanwhile, her professional success has been 
coupled with a steadfast commitment of paying it forward. Meghan is the 
Treasurer of South Buffalo Roots, a rising community organization 
responsible for organizing the very successful South Buffalo Porchfest, 
Music in the Park series and South Buffalo Irish Festival. This 
dedicated group of volunteers in turn supports an array of neighborhood 
organizations using a creative model of giving back to other charitable 
organizations including, the South Buffalo Community Table, Buffalo 
Irish Center, Buffalo Refuse, local sports and school organizations, 
11-Day Powerplay, Kids Escaping Drugs, and Feed the Front Line. 
Citizens like Meghan--those who are consumed with doing right by their 
neighbors are what makes Buffalo so special. Her commitment to 
professional excellence and bettering the Western New York community 
make for an incredible endorsement of Mount Mercy Academy and its 
principles.
  The award recipients and honorees tonight for Mount Mercy Academy&#x27;s 
22nd Annual Dinner have exceeded the already rigorous standard for the 
members within this community. Mount Mercy&#x27;s values and commitment to 
service are steeped in decades of tradition, and Meghan Crotty Quinn 
continues to live these values in her career and relationships.
