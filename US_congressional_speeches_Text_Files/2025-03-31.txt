                  CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF PATSY PETTUS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, March 31, 2025

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the 
life of Patsy Pettus, a cherished member of our community. Patsy is an 
extraordinary individual whose life has exemplified nothing short of 
the beauty in living life curiously.
  Patsy is a passionate member of the Richmond community. Through her 
love of art and architecture, she has bettered the lives of everyone 
around her. Described by many as the ``role model for aging 
gracefully,&#x27;&#x27; her lively character has made her a beloved figure to all 
who have the joy of knowing her. Patsy&#x27;s commitment to the local 
community leaves an indelible mark on our district and beyond.
  Patsy&#x27;s efforts as an advocate for art programs across the state will 
leave a legacy to inspire generations to come. The Virginia Museum of 
Fine Arts, where she volunteered as a docent decades ago, has benefited 
greatly from her and her beloved husband Hunter&#x27;s generosity and 
support. Her family&#x27;s contributions to Virginia Commonwealth 
University&#x27;s (VCU) Institute for Contemporary Arts helped transform the 
creative arts programs at VCU. Ask anyone in Richmond&#x27;s art scene and 
Patsy&#x27;s name will bring a sparkle to their eyes--She has always been 
known as the life of the party.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in celebrating Patsy. Our community is eternally grateful for 
everything she and her husband Hunter have done.

                          ____________________

  HONORING JUDY ADAMS AND THE I SUPPORT THE 1% FOOD PANTRY FOR THEIR 
                      SERVICE TO MICHIGAN VETERANS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, March 31, 2025

  Mrs. McClain. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
extraordinary dedication and service of Judy Adams, Director of the I 
Support the 1% Food Pantry. The I Support the 1% Food Pantry, an 
organization celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, is committed 
to ensuring that no veteran in Michigan goes hungry. Through their 
tireless efforts, Judy and her team have provided not just food but 
also hope and dignity to those who bravely served our Nation.
  Founded on July 28, 2014, and opening its doors in April 2015, the I 
Support the 1% Food Pantry was established in response to the growing 
crisis of food insecurity among veterans and military reserve members. 
Too many of our Nation&#x27;s heroes struggle to put food on the table, 
often feeling ashamed or hopeless in their hardship Judy and her team 
understand the critical need for support and made it their mission to 
ensure that ``No Veteran Should Ever Go Hungry.&#x27;&#x27;
  The pantry partners with VA social workers, including those in the 
HUD-VASH Homeless program and Home-Based Primary Care program, to 
ensure food reaches veterans in need--even those who are homebound due 
to medical conditions.
  Additionally, the I Support the 1% Food Pantry works directly with 
military reserve units, assisting service members and their families 
during times of financial difficulty. Since its founding, the pantry 
has served over 1,000 veterans across Michigan, including WWII and 
Korean War veterans living on fixed incomes, combat-wounded veterans, 
and those struggling with PTSD and economic hardship. For many, the 
pantry is the difference between going hungry and being able to provide 
for their families. Thanks to Judy Adams and I Support the 1% Food 
Pantry, these veterans now have a place to turn for assistance and 
compassion.
  Mr. Speaker, the work of Judy Adams and the I Support the 1% Food 
Pantry is a testament to the power of community and service. Their 
unwavering commitment to Michigan&#x27;s veterans embodies the very spirit 
of selflessness and patriotism. Today, we honor Judy Adams for her 
leadership, her compassion, and her unyielding dedication to ensuring 
that those who have served our Nation never have to face hunger alone.

          HONORING MRS. ROSA MAE WILLIAMS ON HER 95TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, March 31, 2025

  Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a devoted mother, 
a woman of faith, and an extraordinary Georgian, Mrs. Rosa Mae 
Williams. Mrs. Williams celebrated her 95th birthday with her family 
and friends on March 22, 2025, in Leary, Georgia.
  Mrs. Williams was born in Chula, Georgia on March 22, 1930. 
Throughout her 95 years on this earth, she has exemplified hard work, 
resilience, and dedication to her community. As a single mother who 
raised 13 children, she faced great challenges but never wavered in her 
commitment to her children&#x27;s education and success. Mrs. Williams takes 
great pride in her children, and while she did not have the opportunity 
to receive a formal education herself, she was successful in steering 
most of her kids towards earning a degree of higher education. They 
attended institutions such as Morehouse College, Spelman College, 
Georgia Tech, Clark Atlanta University, and Albany State University.
  A woman of strong faith, Mrs. Williams has been a member of Bethel 
C.M.E. Church in Leary for over 70 years where she currently holds the 
position of Mother of the Church. Her deep faith has been the guiding 
light of her life, and her legacy is rooted in her devotion to both her 
family and her Heavenly Father.
  Mrs. Williams instilled within her children the importance of hard 
work, education, and faith. Over the course of her life, she has been 
proud to see her offspring continue to make meaningful contributions to 
the community. Thanks to her devoted parenting, her children have gone 
on to take on professions as attorneys, educators, elected officials, 
corporate managers, and more.
  Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm once said that ``service is the 
rent we pay for the space we occupy here on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; As we 
celebrate Mrs. Williams&#x27; 95 years of life, we can say without a doubt 
that Mrs. Rosa Mae Williams has paid her rent and paid it well. Her 
dedicated life of service to her family and community is truly 
commendable. I know that her children and grandchildren are very proud 
of her and look up to their matriarch as a role model of faith and 
unconditional love.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives to join my wife Vivian, and me--along with the family 
and loved ones of Mrs. Rosa Mae Williams--in extending our heartfelt 
congratulations and best wishes to her on this remarkable occasion. May 
God continue to bless her with health, peace, and joy, and may her 
example continue to inspire us all.

                          ____________________

     HONORING THETA PI ZETA CHAPTER OF ZETA PHI BETA SORORITY, INC.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, March 31, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
truly exceptional organization, the Theta Pi Zeta Chapter of Zeta Phi 
Beta Sorority, Inc., based in Itta Bena, Mississippi. Since its 
inception, the chapter has been a steadfast beacon of service, 
community involvement, and the embodiment of the principles upheld by 
Zeta Phi Beta.
  Founded on November 10, 1976, with the leadership of then State 
Director Bertha Blackburn and co-founders Henri E. Lowe and Maxine P. 
Stewart, Theta Pi Zeta began its journey in a small yet significant way 
at the Western Sizzlin&#x27; Steak House in Greenwood, Mississippi. The 
chapter&#x27;s roots are deeply intertwined with the spirit of dedication, 
as evidenced by the work of Henri E. Lowe and M&#x27;Elena Matthews, who 
signed the chapter&#x27;s charter application, helping to ensure its 
establishment.
  Throughout the years, 14 remarkable women have served as president, 
with the late Henri E. Lowe leading the charge during the formative 
years. Currently, under the leadership of Denise Pitchford, the chapter 
continues its dedication to service and community outreach, earning 
recognition at the state and regional levels. The chapter boasts 32 
financial members and has been involved in countless community 
initiatives, such as hosting a State Round-Up for Zetas in Greenwood, 
Mississippi, and supporting local events like the March for Babies 
campaign.
  The Itta Bena Amicae Auxiliary, established in 1986 and sponsored by 
Sister Shirley Burks, remains a vital part of the chapter&#x27;s outreach 
efforts, and the chapter&#x27;s youth auxiliaries--including the Archonette, 
Amicette, and Pearlette Clubs--engage in community service projects 
like adopting families for Thanksgiving and Christmas, ringing 
Salvation Army bells, and delivering care bags to local nursing homes.
  The chapter&#x27;s charter members, such as Riller Bennett, Thelma 
Collins, Laura Davis, Doroty Edwards, Amanda Elzy, Anna Hicks, Irene 
Howard, Zelma Howard, Jean Jennings, Henri E. Lowe, M&#x27;Elena Mathews, 
Betty Morris, Geneva Pickens, Henrine Stewart, Bobbie Wicks, Ann 
Wilson, and Malinda Winters laid the foundation for what has become a 
powerful and enduring force in the Mississippi Delta. Many of them have 
left lasting legacies, including the late Henri E. Lowe, and Florence 
Weathersby, who served for an impressive 70 years and remained an 
inspiration to many.
  The chapter&#x27;s commitment to service continues with a full slate of 
community activities for 2025, including events like hosting a 
Sisterhood Tea for Women&#x27;s History Month, visiting nursing homes, 
organizing water hydration drives, and supporting the March of Dimes 
Campaign.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking a moment to 
acknowledge the Theta Pi Zeta Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., 
for their unwavering dedication to service, leadership, and the 
betterment of their community.

            HONORING THE LIFE OF BRENDA FAYE GRAHAM JOHNSON

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, March 31, 2025

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Brenda Faye Graham 
Johnson, who passed away on March 26th at the age of 77.
  On March 31, 1947, Ms. Johnson was born in Christiansburg, Virginia, 
but was raised in nearby Salem, Virginia. After graduating from Andrew 
Lewis High School, she attended Marion College in Marion, Virginia. Ms. 
Johnson graduated as part of the last class from Marion College.
  Following her studies at Radford University, where she earned a 
teaching degree, Ms. Johnson taught in the classroom. She stayed close 
to Southwest Virginia during her life and raised a family with her 
loving husband, Don, by her side.
  In addition to her service as an educator, Ms. Johnson helped 
contribute to the Republican Party of Virginia in various capacities.
  Primarily, Ms. Johnson held officer roles in the Republican Party of 
Bristol and the Republican Party of Salem, two units who helped shape 
local conservative candidates for elected office.
  Virginia&#x27;s Ninth District Republican Committee benefitted from Ms. 
Johnson&#x27;s loyalty and service, particularly in her role as the 
Committee&#x27;s official secretary. This sometimes required her throughout 
the year to drive away from home to assist the Committee with its 
meetings and business.
  A woman of strong faith and appreciation for the Lord, Ms. Johnson 
was an active member of Salem&#x27;s First United Methodist Church.
  In addition to her husband, family remaining to cherish her memory 
includes her children, Jessica J. Funk (Kevin), and Lauren J. Paige, 
both of Richmond, Va.; grandson, Declan Funk; siblings, Connie Melton 
(Carter), Jennifer Brown (Bill), and Bradley Graham; and many nieces 
and nephews.
  I always appreciated her dedication to the Republican Party and 
helping the various Republican committees where she was living.
  Further, Brenda and her husband helped to start the Salem G.O.P.&#x27;s 
annual Olde Salem Days Breakfast which has grown into a major event for 
candidates seeking a Republican nomination in Virginia.
  Ms. Johnson&#x27;s love for Southwest Virginia and her community was 
strongly evident. Whether it was helping a student with reading or 
passing out campaign literature to voters, Ms. Johnson made a profound 
impression on those around her. She will be missed.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, March 31, 2025

   Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career and 
legacy of Bob Davidson. Bob is retiring after 23 years of committed 
service as the CEO and President of the Seattle Aquarium. I am so 
grateful for his tireless efforts to make the Seattle Aquarium a leader 
in conservation, education, and visitor experience.
  Thanks to Bob&#x27;s leadership, the Seattle Aquarium is now the largest 
marine conservation institution in the northwestern United States. His 
work has transformed the Seattle Aquarium from a local aquarium into a 
globally recognized conservation organization. Bob waited to step down 
from his post until the completion of the $180 million Ocean Pavilion, 
which highlights sea life in the biodiverse Indo-Pacific Coral Triangle 
and educates guests on how we must work together to protect the world&#x27;s 
oceans. His wide array of professional experiences helped him forge the 
partnerships necessary to complete the Ocean Pavilion project. Bob also 
led Woodland Park Zoo&#x27;s $40 million renovation project that transformed 
the zoo into a modern leader for design and habitats.
  Thanks to Bob Davidson&#x27;s many accomplishments, Seattle has seen 
significant expansion and continued improvement of the Aquarium&#x27;s 
buildings, the ongoing transformation of the Seattle waterfront, and 
the growing reputation of the Seattle Aquarium as a global leader in 
ocean conservation. I am very grateful for his incredible service and 
confident that he will continue to be a staunch advocate for protecting 
our oceans and sea life. His leadership will serve as a model for years 
to come.

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nathan 
Whittington of Broomfield, Colorado for receiving the 2024 Statewide 
Emergency Manager of the Year Award.
  As the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office&#x27;s Emergency Manager, Nathan 
leads coordination and response plans during natural disasters and 
other emergencies. He was instrumental in developing Jeffco&#x27;s new 
Emergency Operations Center. During the Quarry Fire in 2024, Nathan 
managed the EOC and re-entry plans--ensuring all evacuees were able to 
return home safely. Nathan&#x27;s commitment to public service extends 
beyond Jefferson County--he also deployed to Sarasota County, Florida 
to provide critical support during Hurricane Milton.
  Nathan has led the way in adapting innovative technology and 
strategies that have strengthened our community&#x27;s preparedness and 
resilience. We are grateful for his leadership and commitment to 
keeping our communities safe.
  On behalf of the people of Colorado&#x27;s Seventh Congressional District,

Commander Lux&#x27;s commitment, strength, and leadership reflects the very

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to salute the 
extraordinary career of Major General Patrick Hamilton, U.S. Army, 
Retired, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation. His service to both 
the Army and

[[Page E272]]

his Nation exemplifies our Nation&#x27;s altruistic spirit.
  MG Hamilton served honorably in Armor and Cavalry units in the Texas 
Army National Guard for 35 years. He served full time in operational 
assignments including Director of the Joint Staff, Chief of Staff to 
the Adjutant General of Texas, and the Texas Army National Guard 
Director of Operations.
  In 2000, MG Hamilton served with the 49th Armored Division in Bosnia-
Herzegovina as the Current Operations Officer. He later deployed to 
Afghanistan where he served as the Red Team Leader for the Commanding 
General. Additionally in 2017, he served as the Joint Task Force 
Commanding General for Hurricane Harvey military response, commanding 
18,000 troops supporting evacuation and aid operations.
  From 2018 to 2021, MG Hamilton served as the Commanding General of 
the 36th Infantry Division, where he commanded soldiers in nine 
countries across the Middle East as part of Task Force Spartan, under 
Operation Spartan Shield.
  MG Hamilton&#x27;s retirement did not end his service. He continues to 
train National Guard Division Commanders and staffs. In addition, he 
serves on the Board of Directors for the Central Texas YMCA and the 
Board of Governors of the Central Texas Community Foundation. For his 
extraordinary efforts during and after service he was awarded the 2023 
Lieutenant General Raymond S. McLain Medal.
  I am honored to join MG Hamilton&#x27;s friends and family in celebrating 
his outstanding achievements. His commitment to selfless service makes 
him a deeply respected and honorable recipient of the Congressional 
Veteran Commendation.
