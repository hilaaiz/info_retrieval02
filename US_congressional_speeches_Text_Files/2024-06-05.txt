             CELEBRATING GREEN TOWNSHIP&#x27;S 200TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 5, 2024

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and 
congratulate Green Township on their 200th anniversary. I am extremely 
grateful to be able to be here today and celebrate this incredible 
milestone. Over the past 200 years, Green Township has shown itself to 
be a lively area with a strong community. In 1824, Green Township 
emerged from the northern parts of Hardwick and Independence townships. 
Over the decades, Green Township has gone through significant changes, 
including expansions, the incorporation of Fredon Township, and the 
rise of vibrant communities like Tranquility and Greendell. As we 
reflect on its history, we can use the past two centuries as reminders 
of the resilience and changes our community has gone through, and the 
future that is to come. I am honored to have such an amazing township 
in the 7th Congressional District, and I look forward to what is to 
come.

                          ____________________

monumental milestone with you all. The Oak Knoll School of the Holy 
Cross was founded by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus and has been

in personal growth and social responsibility. Over the past 100 years, 
Oak Knoll has fostered a welcoming diverse student body of inquisitive 
students who think critically, embrace knowledge, respond with moral 
and ethical integrity, and make responsible choices that enrich their 
own lives and contribute to the lives of others. The Oak Knoll School 
has maintained a steadfast commitment to integrating faith with 
education, promoting a community of compassionate and informed citizens 
who are ready to lead and serve in a global society. The past 100 years 
have served as a reflection of the vibrant legacy that will continue to 
inspire and shape future generations. The Oak Knoll School of the Holy 
Cross has stood as a testament to a century&#x27;s worth of educational 
innovation, resilience, and dedication. May the school&#x27;s next 100 years 
be filled with as much success as the past 100 years.

     CONGRATULATING NANCY GARDNER ON HER RETIREMENT FROM EDUCATION

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 5, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr Speaker, I rise to recognize Nancy Gardner, who 
retired in April of this year after 44 years of selfless commitment to 
education. Throughout her incredible career, Nancy served the Port 
Huron Area Schools, Landmark Academy, and the East Shore Leadership 
Academy, which she founded and has led over the last decade.
  A Michigan native, Nancy earned her Bachelor of Science from Northern 
Michigan University and went on to earn two Master of Arts degrees from 
Central Michigan University. After graduating, she earned her special 
education teaching certification and quickly began serving those in 
need. She later returned to education to serve as a special education 
teacher and Assistant Principal for Holland Woods Middle School in Port 
Huron. In the evenings, she worked part-time as a substance abuse 
therapist and registered social worker. Nancy has also furnished a 
reputation for her knowledge in crisis management, having received 
special training from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1999-2000.
  Nancy has traveled both inside and outside of the United States to 
receive--and offer--training to accommodate different learning styles.
  Throughout her inspiring career in education, Nancy has spearheaded 
remarkable change and has, without a doubt, changed the academic 
landscape in Port Huron and beyond. I am confident that her decades of 
instruction, leadership, and commitment to education will leave a 
lasting impact for many years to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 
occasion of Nancy Gardner&#x27;s retirement after 44 years in education.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 5, 2024

  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
distinguished career and dedicated community service of Sauk Rapids 
Mayor Kurt Hunstiger who recently announced his retirement from public 
office.
  Mayor Hunstiger&#x27;s tenure in public service is truly commendable. Over 
the past 30 years, he has served in various positions, including 18 
years as a city council member and the last eight years as mayor. His 
leadership has been instrumental in shaping the community, as he guided 
Sauk Rapids through times of growth and change.
  Despite retiring from his day job in finance four years ago, Mayor 
Hunstiger continued to dedicate his time and energy to the betterment 
of Sauk Rapids. In a letter to the community and city staff announcing 
his retirement, Kurt expressed his gratitude for their support and 
collaboration over the years. In this next chapter he plans to spend 
more time with his family.
  Under Mayor Hunstiger&#x27;s stewardship, Sauk Rapids has thrived. He 
leaves behind a legacy of fiscal responsibility and a commitment to 
community engagement. His efforts secured the city&#x27;s fiscal stability, 
ensuring a strong foundation for the future.
  His dedication, vision, and hard work over the years have made the 
Sauk Rapids community a better place to live, work, and raise a family.
  We are sincerely grateful for Mayor Hunstiger&#x27;s service and 
contributions to Sauk Rapids and Benton County and wish him a 
fulfilling and joyful retirement.

                        Wednesday, June 5, 2024

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and honor the 250th 
anniversary of the Prince William Resolves.
  Today, I am honored to commemorate the unveiling and dedication of a 
historical marker in remembrance of the Price William Resolves, a 
celebration co-hosted by the National Society Daughters of the American 
Revolution, Prince William Resolves Chapter and the Prince William 
County Historical Commission.
  In 1774, the Prince William Resolves were passed in opposition to the 
British crown and in response to the call for support from patriots in 
Boston, Massachusetts following the Boston Tea Party. This moment 
marked the first act of public defiance against British rule in 
Virginia. Today, the Prince William community gathers to celebrate the 
bravery and patriotism of those who came before us. Through this 
marker, visitors and the community alike will continue to learn about 
the courage with which Prince William&#x27;s residents stood up to achieve 
rule by the people.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 250th 
anniversary of the Prince William Resolves. I am honored to represent 
the Prince William community and am proud of the work they do to keep 
our history alive.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 5, 2024

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor the life of Catherine ``Cathy&#x27;&#x27; Marcucci, who proudly served the 
City of Industry as Mayor Pro Tem until her passing on April 26 at the 
age of 60, after a hard-fought, three-year battle against aggressive 
anaplastic thyroid cancer.
  Cathy was a beloved wife, mother, daughter, and sister, and a dear 
friend to many. A lifelong resident of Southern California, Cathy began 
her civic career in 2017 as a member of the City of Industry city 
council, where she served continuously, stepping into the role of Mayor 
Pro Tem in 2019. Always eager to be involved in meetings with my staff 
and me, she was very gracious to all and never wavered from her 
commitment to assist her constituents.
  Throughout her tenure, Cathy demonstrated exemplary leadership, 
fostering collaboration and championing causes that uplifted the lives 
of people and furry companions alike. An avid animal lover, Cathy 
spearheaded efforts to establish the first no-kill animal rescue in the 
San Gabriel Valley.
  Cathy is survived by her husband Steve Marcucci; daughter Lauren 
Eigel and son-in-law, Pete; parents, Larry and Etta Colson; brother and 
sister, Tim Colson and Chrissy Lowe, and their families; and countless 
dear friends. She is also survived by her rambunctious four dogs and 
two cats, all equally beloved and in no particular order: Nemo, Lola, 
Rosie, Louee, Lucy, and Laci.

[[Page E594]]

  I extend my deepest sympathies to the family, colleagues, friends, 
and constituents of Cathy Marcucci, and I urge all my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing her life and public service. She will be solely 
missed.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 5, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wynn Jacobson-
Galan, a PhD graduate in Astrophysics of the University of California, 
Berkeley for exemplifying leadership in physics education and service 
to California&#x27;s and the nation&#x27;s scientific community.
  Wynn is a great example of the strength and health of the University 
of California system to create tomorrow&#x27;s future leaders of science. A 
graduate of Malibu High School and proud California resident, Wynn 
Jacobson-Galan began his undergraduate career in the community college 
system, before transferring to the University of California Santa Cruz. 
He then attended graduate school at the University of California 
Berkeley. Wynn dedicated his studies to furthering understanding the 
history of our solar system, and how it may shape our planet&#x27;s future. 
At the University of California, Santa Cruz, he conducted research on 
thermonuclear transients of all varieties under the guidance of 
Professor Ryan Foley. At UC Berkeley, he conducted research under the 
mentorship of Professor Rafaella Margutti, studying the final moments 
of a star&#x27;s life before death.
  Wynn is graduating as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research 
Fellow at UC Berkeley, working on supernova progenitor systems and 
transient astronomy. This research involved combining multi-wavelength 
observations of a variety of supernova types to create a complete 
picture of the final stages of stellar instability and mass loss before 
explosion. Following his graduation, Wynn will be conducting research 
at the California Institute of Technology.
  His academic journey would not have been as successful if not for the 
unwavering support of his family. Their encouragement and support have 
been instrumental in shaping Wynn into the dedicated and accomplished 
leader he is today.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in 
extending our deepest congratulations and best wishes to Wynn Jacobson-
Galan as he embarks on this new chapter of his life. His academic 
contributions will forever resonate within the halls of the 
institutions he attended, and in the hearts of those who have had the 
privilege of working alongside him. We hope he continues to advance our 
understanding of the universe and we wish him the best of luck in this 
next chapter of his life.

                        Wednesday, June 5, 2024

  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the ProYouth 
organization on their 30-year anniversary and to thank them for their 
significant contributions to the Central Valley. In 1991, a dedicated 
group of volunteers from Visalia came together to establish Visalians 
for a Gang Free Community, aiming to address the challenges faced by 
children affected by gang violence in the Tulare community. Three years 
later, the organization attained non-profit status and became known as 
ProYouth. In 1998, ProYouth established their inaugural program, 
HEART--Health, Enrichment, Academics--to increase access to after 
school opportunities for students. For more than 30 years, ProYouth has 
remained committed to its mission to protect all children from gang 
violence through after school programs and other essential initiatives. 
Today, ProYouth serves nearly 20,000 students annually across 60 
schools in the Central Valley. In addition to their educational grant- 
and contract-based programs, ProYouth&#x27;s dedicated staff and volunteers 
also provide meals to students. Just this year alone, ProYouth is 
expected to serve one million meals to its program&#x27;s attendees. Through 
their wide range of programs and initiatives, ProYouth develops 
students&#x27; academic, social, and emotional skills, equipping them with 
the foundation they need to succeed in their futures. During the COVID-
19 pandemic, ProYouth was essential in helping Central Valley families 
who were impacted by school closures and the transition to remote-
learning. ProYouth established a program to provide support and an in-
person learning environment for affected students. For more than three 
decades, ProYouth has helped not only support our Central Valley 
students, but they have given them the tools to succeed in life. Their 
work to enrich the lives of these students will be felt for generations 
to come. Mr Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives to join me in celebrating ProYouth on their 30-year 
anniversary.
