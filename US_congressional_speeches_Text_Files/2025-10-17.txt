                 CELEBRATING SPAIN&#x27;S NATIONAL DAY 2025

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the people of Spain 
and millions around the world in celebrating Spain&#x27;s National Day, 
known as Fiesta Nacional de Espana (National Day of Spain).
  As Co-Chair of the Friends of Spain Caucus, I am proud to honor the 
deep and enduring bonds between our two nations, bonds rooted in shared 
history, faith, and friendship.
  From the earliest days of our Republic, Spain played a pivotal role 
in supporting American independence, providing vital aid and 
recognition to our Founding Fathers in their struggle for liberty. The 
names of St. Augustine, Pensacola, and San Marcos remind us that 
Florida&#x27;s story is inseparable from the Spanish legacy that helped 
shape our Nation&#x27;s earliest frontiers.
  Spanish influence can be seen in our architecture, our language, our 
traditions, and the vibrant communities that call South Florida home. 
Every day, centuries-old ties continue to inspire cultural exchange, 
economic partnership, and mutual respect between our peoples.
  On this National Day of Spain, we celebrate not only the remarkable 
history of the Spanish nation, but also the shared values of democracy, 
freedom, and friendship that unite Spain and the United States.
  I look forward to strengthening our transatlantic partnership and 
ensuring that the friendship between our Nations continues to flourish 
for generations to come.

  CONGRATULATING NICKLAUS CHILDREN&#x27;S HOSPITAL ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Ms. SALAZAR. Mr. Speaker, Nicklaus Children&#x27;s Hospital, formerly 
known as Miami Children&#x27;s Hospital until 2015, was founded in 1950 and 
is South Florida&#x27;s only free-standing pediatric hospital. Staffed by 
850 physicians and more than 500 pediatric subspecialists, Nicklaus is 
home to the largest pediatric teaching program in the southeastern 
United States. It is renowned for excellence in all aspects of 
pediatric medicine, and according to U.S. News &amp; World Report, many of 
Nicklaus&#x27;s specialty programs ranking among the best in the Nation 
since 2008.
  The tremendous impact Nicklaus has is not felt in District 27 alone. 
Nicklaus Children&#x27;s Health System, the parent organization of Nicklaus 
Children&#x27;s Hospital, maintains an extensive network of outpatient and 
urgent care centers in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Martin 
Counties, serving families throughout Florida, the United States, and 
more than 100 countries.
  Not only does Nicklaus maintain an extensive network but it also 
continues to ensure children and their families have access to the 
specialized care they need and deserve. Nicklaus offers more than 30 
pediatric specialties and operates leading institutes focused on 
pediatric care, including the Helen and Jacob Shaham Cancer and Blood 
Disorders Institute, the Brain Institute, the Heart Institute, and the 
Orthopedic, Sports Medicine, and Spine Institute. And just last year, 
the Hospital opened the Kenneth C. Griffin Surgical Tower, one of the 
most innovative pediatric surgical facilities in the United States, 
ensuring that children and adolescents can receive expert surgical care 
without leaving Florida.
  Additionally, Nicklaus has a top-of-the-line emergency transportation 
fleet. The Hospital&#x27;s LifeFlight Critical Care Transport Program, which 
includes six ambulances, two helicopters, and fixed-wing jets equipped 
for pediatric and neonatal patients, saves nearly 4,000 infants and 
children annually across Florida, the Caribbean, and Central and South 
America.
  From Miami to the Panhandle, from the Panhandle to Central and South 
America, from Central and South America to the Caribbean, Nicklaus is a 
world-class institution that has provided care to so many for decades. 
On the occasion of its 75th anniversary, I want to congratulate 
Nicklaus Children&#x27;s Hospital and commend its continued commitment to 
advancing pediatric health care for children and families in Miami, 
throughout the country, and across the world.

                  HONORING MR. PATRICK MORAN&#x27;S SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. TONY WIED

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional 
community leader, veteran, and volunteer, Mr. Patrick Moran.
  In recognition of Mr. Moran&#x27;s selfless service and steadfast 
leadership, he is the recipient of the 2025 De Pere Community Silver 
Knight Award. Since 1968, the De Pere Community Silver Knight Award has 
been bestowed upon outstanding individuals nominated by De Pere service 
clubs, civic organizations or members of the community.
  Mr. Moran&#x27;s decades of service are truly remarkable. It is evident 
that Mr. Moran has dedicated his life to serving others and has 
undoubtedly played an instrumental role in the success of several 
organizations throughout Brown County and Northeast Wisconsin. From his 
time serving as a Cub Scout Leader and Soccer Coach in De Pere to his 
over 50 years with the De Pere VFW Post 2113, Mr. Moran&#x27;s unwavering 
support and guidance deserves our highest admiration.
  In addition to Mr. Moran&#x27;s community service, his most important role 
has been a supportive husband to his wife Linda and father to three 
children, Phillip, Renee, and Nickolas. Throughout his children&#x27;s 
upbringing, Pat was a leader that you could always count on--serving as 
a Cub Scout Leader, Lost Dauphin 4H leader, Soccer Coach, and member of 
the MBX Motorcycle Club and the West De Pere Snow Owls Snowmobile Club. 
I commend Mr. Moran&#x27;s unwavering commitment to Northeast Wisconsin.
  Mr. Moran&#x27;s decades of guidance, support, and leadership in his 
community deserve the highest degree of recognition. I ask my 
colleagues to join me to congratulate Mr. Patrick Moran on receiving 
the 2025 De Pere Community Silver Knight Award. I am proud to represent 
such incredible men and women who call Northeast Wisconsin home.

                         HONORING PAUL ECKSTEIN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. GREG STANTON

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Paul Eckstein, a giant in 
Arizona law and a stalwart public servant, on the remarkable occasion 
of his 60th work anniversary at Perkins Coie LLP.
  Paul worked on many consequential legal disputes in Arizona history 
that shaped the state&#x27;s legal and civic landscape. He brought a rare 
combination of trial skill, appellate judgment, and moral clarity. Time 
and again, he shows Arizonans that the law can correct course and 
restore trust.
  As lead counsel for the Arizona House of Representatives in the 1988 
impeachment of Governor Evan Mecham, he tried the case with rigor and 
restraint--cross-examining the governor, arguing the evidence, and 
reminding Arizona that no one is above the law. The Senate&#x27;s verdict 
confirmed the point, and renewed public faith that our Constitution has 
teeth when it must.
  Early in Paul&#x27;s career, he represented Navajo leader Tom Shirley in 
Shirley v. Superior Court, securing a decision that affirmed Native 
American citizens living on reservations are fully entitled to hold 
public office in Arizona. He defended voter-driven reform by helping 
ensure Clean Elections reached the ballot. He stood up for independent 
redistricting when it mattered most, supporting the reinstatement of 
the Independent Redistricting Commission&#x27;s chair. And he defended 
Arizona&#x27;s merit-based judgeship selection, fending off efforts to 
politicize the bench. Across these battles runs a common thread: Paul 
used the law to safeguard the people&#x27;s voice and the independence of 
our courts.
  What sets Paul apart is not only what he has done, but how he has 
done it. He takes the lawyer&#x27;s oath seriously--so seriously that he 
chooses principle over convenience, even when it costs him. He demands 
candor. He proves, by example, that zealous advocacy and impeccable 
ethics go hand in hand.
  Paul&#x27;s extraordinary impact extends well beyond the courtroom. He 
taught constitutional law at Arizona State University, and his students 
now serve across our state. At his alma mater, Pomona College, he and 
his wife, Florence ``Flo&#x27;&#x27; Eckstein, endowed a scholarship for refugee 
and forcibly displaced students, opening doors for those whose lives 
were upended by conflict or catastrophe.
  Paul served for decades on the board of Phoenix Children&#x27;s Hospital, 
including as Board Chair. At Arizona State University, the Flo Eckstein 
Endowment supports students focused on children, youth, and families, 
and the Albert &amp; Liese Eckstein Scholar-in-Residence brings leading 
voices in Jewish studies to our community each year. For more than 
three decades, the Ecksteins stewarded the Jewish

[[Page E974]]

News of Greater Phoenix, preserving a vital forum for community life 
and donating archives that keep history alive. Their philanthropy is 
practical and personal: it meets people where they are and lifts them 
up.
  Paul also lives his values through pro bono work. He stands with 
those without a voice and no means--most recently as part of a team 
recognized by the federal court for advancing a prisoner civil-rights 
case to trial. He has served with the Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil 
Rights Under Law, lending Arizona&#x27;s steady voice to the cause of equal 
justice.
  Mr. Speaker, Arizona is a better place because of Paul Eckstein. He 
has defended our Constitution in court and in public life; he has 
protected fair elections and independent courts; he has fought for a 
free press and for equal justice; and he has invested his time, talent, 
and treasure to care for children, and educate the next generation.
  On behalf of the people of Arizona, I congratulate Paul on 60 years 
of distinguished service at Perkins Coie. I thank him for his example 
of courage and integrity, and I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating a lawyer, teacher, and citizen whose life&#x27;s work has 
strengthened our state.

    HONORING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLUE WATER HABITAT FOR HUMANITY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the 35th Anniversary of Blue Water Habitat for Humanity, a remarkable 
organization serving the people of St. Clair and Sanilac Counties with 
integrity, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to strengthening 
our communities through the power of homeownership.
  Founded on the belief that every individual deserves a safe, decent, 
and affordable place to live, Blue Water Habitat for Humanity has never 
given away homes--it has built opportunities. Through its ``hand-up, 
not a handout&#x27;&#x27; model, it has empowered hardworking families to achieve 
independence by requiring sweat equity, responsible financial 
preparation, and a sustainable mortgage. This principled approach has 
helped countless families put down roots and build brighter futures.
  Blue Water Habitat is a community institution. It is locally funded, 
locally operated, and deeply invested in the well-being of the people 
it serves. While affiliated with Habitat for Humanity International and 
Habitat Michigan, every dollar donated stays right here, supporting 
neighbors and revitalizing neighborhoods across Port Huron, St. Clair, 
and Sanilac County.
  Beyond new home construction, Blue Water Habitat provides critical 
home repair programs, ensuring seniors, veterans, and families facing 
hardship can maintain safe living conditions. Its ReStore, run largely 
by volunteers, diverts

[[Page E975]]

usable materials from landfills, offers low-cost household goods, and 
directly funds housing initiatives, demonstrating innovation, 
stewardship, and community partnership.
  For 35 years, volunteers, churches, businesses, and civic 
organizations have come together under one mission: to build stability, 
dignity, and hope. Blue Water Habitat for Humanity stands as a 
testament to what can be achieved when a community serves alongside one 
another in common purpose.
  Mr. Speaker, on this milestone anniversary, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in honoring Blue Water Habitat for Humanity--its leadership, 
volunteers, donors, and partner families, for three and a half decades 
of faithful service. May their example continue to inspire service, 
personal responsibility, and the belief that stronger homes build 
stronger communities.

        HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AURORA ACTIONAIRES

                                 ______

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the Aurora Actionaires, a remarkable milestone for an 
organization that has stood as a beacon of service, leadership, and 
community empowerment in Aurora, Illinois, for half a century.
  Since its founding in 1975, when three friends, Donna Williams, 
Martha Hickling, and Caroline Johnson, met at Hoi Peng Restaurant in 
Aurora on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1974, and decided to form a social club, the 
Aurora Actionaires has consistently demonstrated what committed civic 
engagement can achieve. What began with a group of eighteen 
enthusiastic friends wanting a better community quickly evolved into a 
force for service and empowerment under their guiding motto: We Care . 
. . We Act . . . We Serve.
  Over these five decades, the Aurora Actionaires have lived that motto 
through their tireless dedication to education, community development, 
youth mentorship, and numerous charitable endeavors across the region. 
They have awarded more than $200,000 in scholarships to high school 
seniors and provided assistance to college students in need. They have 
hosted workshops for parents and students on completing scholarship and 
financial aid applications and supported eighth-grade graduates 
attending the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy&#x27;s SEAMS Summer 
Enrichment Program, helping young people pursue academic excellence and 
opportunity.
  On their golden anniversary, we reflect on the many lives touched, 
the students who would not have pursued higher education without their 
support, families whose neighborhoods have been strengthened through 
their volunteerism, and civic institutions that have benefited from 
their leadership and investment. The Aurora Actionaires have built 
bridges across generations, across neighborhoods, and across divides 
and have always modeled the belief that progress is shared when we lift 
others.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have the Aurora Actionaires as part of 
Illinois&#x27; 11th Congressional District. They have demonstrated what it 
means to transform compassion into action and service into lasting 
impact, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on 
their golden anniversary and thank them for their unwavering dedication 
to building a stronger, more vibrant community for all.

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. PABLO JOSE HERNANDEZ

                             of puerto rico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. HERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and 
legacy of a remarkable public servant, Carlos Alberto Lopez Rivera, 
better known to his beloved community simply as ``Carlitos.&#x27;&#x27;
  Born on September 14, 1958, in Dorado, Carlitos grew up with the 
values of hard work, service, and loyalty instilled in him by his 
parents, Pedro Lopez Maldonado and Ana Rivera. After graduating from 
Jose S. Alegria High School and earning a degree in Business Management 
from the University of Puerto Rico, he could have chosen many paths. 
But his heart was rooted in Dorado, and he devoted himself to serving 
the very place that had shaped him.
  That calling led him to the mayor&#x27;s office, where on August 3, 1987, 
he was sworn in as the mayor of Dorado. What followed was nothing short 
of historic. For 38 years, through 10 consecutive elections, Carlitos 
was entrusted by his neighbors with the responsibility of guiding their 
community. He transformed Dorado into a thriving center of tourism and 
development while never losing sight of the needs of working families. 
He often described Dorado as the ``paradise of Puerto Rico, where life 
is beautiful,&#x27;&#x27; and under his leadership, that vision became a reality.
  But Carlitos was more than just an astute and skillful politician. He 
was a man of loyalty, wit, and heart. He had a gift for words, painting 
images and phrases that stuck in the memory of the people he served. He 
balanced economic progress with social justice, reminding all who knew 
him that growth should never leave anyone behind. And to those who knew 
him best, he will always be remembered for his loyalty. In the hardest 
and loneliest moments, Carlitos was there, steadfast and encouraging, 
urging us forward ``at full speed and with even greater strength.&#x27;&#x27;
  Carlitos made history as one of the longest-serving mayors in Puerto 
Rican history, second only to his contemporary in Manati, Juan Aubin 
Cruz Manzano. Yet beyond the records and accomplishments, his true 
legacy will live on in the people of Dorado, who saw in him not only a 
mayor, but a neighbor, a motivator, and a guardian of their community&#x27;s 
spirit.
  Mr. Speaker, the life of Carlos Alberto `Carlitos&#x27; Lopez Rivera 
reminds us that true leadership is measured not only in years of 
service, but in the lives uplifted along the way. Our prayers are with 
his family, and I respectfully ask this body to rise in tribute to his 
life and service. As we reflect on his legacy, may we honor him by 
carrying his spirit forward, always pressing on ``at full speed and 
with even greater strength.&#x27;&#x27;
  The following text is a direct Spanish translation of the statement 
above:

       Mr. Speaker, me levanto hoy para rendir homenaje a la 
     memoria y el legado de un servidor publico extraordinario, 
     Carlos Alberto Lopez Rivera, conocido por su querido pueblo 
     como ``Carlitos.&#x27;&#x27;
       Nacido el 14 de septiembre de 1958 en Dorado, Carlitos 
     crecio con los valores de trabajo duro, servicio y lealtad 
     inculcados por sus padres, Pedro Lopez Maldonado y Ana 
     Rivera. Tras graduarse de la Escuela Superior Jose S. Alegria 
     y obtener un titulo en Administracion de Empresas de la 
     Universidad de Puerto Rico, pudo haber elegido muchos 
     caminos. Pero su corazon estaba en Dorado, y dedico su vida a 
     servir al pueblo que lo habia formado.
       Ese llamado lo llevo a la alcaldia, donde el 3 de agosto de 
     1987 juro como alcalde de Dorado. Lo que siguio fue nada 
     menos que historico. Durante 38 anos, a traves de 10 
     elecciones consecutivas, Carlitos fue confiado por sus 
     vecinos con la responsabilidad de guiar a su pueblo. 
     Transformo a Dorado en un centro prospero de turismo y 
     desarrollo, sin perder nunca de vista las necesidades de las 
     familias trabajadoras. A menudo describe a Dorado como el 
     ``paraiso de Puerto Rico, donde la vida es bella,&#x27;&#x27; y bajo su 
     liderazgo, esa vision se convirtio en realidad.
       Pero Carlitos fue mas que un politico astuto y habil. Fue 
     un hombre de lealtad, ingenio y corazon. Tenia un don para 
     las palabras, pintando imagenes y frases que permanecian en 
     la memoria de la gente a la que servia. Supo equilibrar el 
     progreso economico con la justicia social, recordando a todos 
     los que lo conocieron que el

[[Page E976]]

     crecimiento no debe dejar a nadie atras. Y para quienes lo 
     conocieron de cerca, siempre sera recordado por su lealtad. 
     En los momentos mas duros y solitarios, Carlitos estaba ahi, 
     firme y alentador, impulsandonos siempre hacia adelante ``a 
     toda marcha y con mas fuerza&#x27;&#x27;.
       Carlitos hizo historia como uno de los alcaldes con mas 
     anos de servicio en Puerto Rico, superado solo por su 
     contemporaneo en Manati, Juan Aubin Cruz Manzano. Sin 
     embargo, mas alla de los records y logros, su verdadero 
     legado vivira en la gente de Dorado, que vio en el no solo a 
     un alcalde, sino a un vecino, un motivador y un guardian del 
     espiritu de su pueblo.
       Mr. Speaker, la vida de Carlos Alberto ``Carlitos&#x27;&#x27; Lopez 
     Rivera nos recuerda que el verdadero liderazgo no se mide 
     solo en los anos de servicio, sino en las vidas que se elevan 
     en el camino. Nuestras oraciones estan con su familia, y 
     respetuosamente pido a la Camara que se levante en tributo a 
     su vida y servicio. Al reflexionar sobre su legado, 
     honremoslo llevando adelante su espiritu, siempre avanzando 
     ``a toda marcha y con mas fuerza.&#x27;&#x27;

                      HON. CHRISTOPHER R. DELUZIO

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Colonel Raymond L. 
Hyland, Jr., United States Air Force, a resident of Cranberry Township, 
PA, who is retiring after 36 years of faithful service to our Nation 
and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania following his commission from Air 
Force ROTC at Kent State University.
  After graduating from Kent State in 1989, Colonel Hyland began his 
dedicated service to our nation. Colonel Hyland served the Air Force in 
a wide variety of roles over the next thirty-six years, both throughout 
the country and overseas.
  His active-duty years include flying assignments at Vance Air Force 
Base in Oklahoma, Castle Air Force Base in California, Plattsburgh Air 
Force Base in New York, and Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota. 
In 1999, Colonel Hyland transferred from active duty to the 
Pennsylvania Air National Guard where he served in various KC-135 
Operations and Maintenance roles at the 171st Air Refueling Wing in 
Moon Township, Pennsylvania, culminating as the Wing&#x27;s Commander.
  Throughout his career, Colonel Hyland has demonstrated exceptional 
commitment to the country. He is a Command Pilot with more than 5,600 
flight hours in various aircraft. His personal awards include the 
Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal (four awards), Air Medal, 
Aerial Achievement Medal (four awards), Air Force Commendation Medal 
(two awards), and the Air Force Achievement Medal.
  I commend Colonel Hyland for his dedication to our country and the 
sacrifices he and his family have made. I thank him, his wife Kim, and 
their two children, Kathleen and Ryan, for their service and wish him 
blue skies as he concludes a distinguished career.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in 
recognizing Colonel Ray Hyland as he retires from the U.S. Air Force.

   PAYING TRIBUTE TO A GREAT AUTHOR, DIRECTOR, AND BALTIMOREAN: JOHN 
                                 WATERS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KWEISI MFUME

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the artistic 
brilliance of legendary filmmaker and beloved Baltimorean, John Waters, 
for his outstanding contributions to the film industry. Affectionately 
dubbed the ``Pope of Trash&#x27;&#x27; by William S. Burroughs, Mr. Waters is a 
renowned author, producer, and director who was honored in 2023 with a 
star on the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.
  His unconventional interpretations of the world color his comical and 
flamboyant films, and he has dedicated his career to what he playfully 
refers to as ``filth&#x27;&#x27; for the big screen.
  An all-time great Baltimorean, Mr. Waters has left an indelible mark 
on the entertainment industry. His love for storytelling was developed 
as a child, putting on puppet shows at children&#x27;s birthday parties. 
Through his teen years, he mastered the skills needed to write side-
splitting scripts, skills that he would put to the test for the rest of 
his lengthy career.
  Waters&#x27; hometown in the greater Baltimore area would become a central 
character in many of his films. Baltimore served as both the backdrop 
and the inspiration for much of

[[Page E973]]

Waters&#x27; early work. His iconic films, such as Pink Flamingos, Desperate 
Living, Female Trouble and Polyester reveal the unique personalities 
and plights he encountered during his formative years in and around 
Baltimore.
  Waters achieved mainstream success in 1988, after directing 
Hairspray, a critically acclaimed musical set in racially segregated 
Baltimore in the 1960s, which explores themes of identity, activism, 
and biases of all kinds. Mr. Waters&#x27; films are renowned for their 
dedicated fan communities, rooted in his dedication to fostering 
diversity on the big screen and his history of encouraging 
individuality amongst fans and peers in the industry.
  Beyond his filmmaking prowess, John Waters&#x27; influence extends to 
literature, art, and social commentary. A veritable gay ambassador 
himself, his artistic adaptations have provided a safe haven for his 
fans to embrace their creativity and self-expression while showing the 
world the brilliance contained within the LGBTQ community.
  The ethos of Mr. Waters&#x27; career is a celebration of the 
counterculture, and a passionate rejection of the norms within the 
entertainment industry that restrain artistic peculiarity and 
originality.
  John Waters&#x27; star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a testament to his 
commitment to pushing the boundaries of creativity--not only through 
his cinematic achievements, but also in life. He encapsulates what it 
means to be a Baltimorean, and our city couldn&#x27;t ask for a better 
champion.
  His career demonstrates how the unlikeliest of places can give birth 
to the most extraordinary stories.
  Mr. Waters has forever changed the landscape of American cinema with 
his style, ingenuity, and wit. His films will continue to inspire the 
next generations of filmmakers while providing an example that shows 
that what some may describe as outrageous might just lead to a new 
artistic frontier.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize and salute Mr. John Samuel 
Waters, Jr., for his unyielding pursuit of humor and originality on the 
silver screen and for his undying love for the one-of-a-kind city that 
we both share, Baltimore.

movement on both state and national levels. Her thoughtful engagement 
with policymakers like myself rooted in collaboration, expertise, and

in the First Congressional District of Pennsylvania and across the 
entire Commonwealth and beyond. Through her advocacy, countless 
individuals have gained new opportunities to achieve financial

    RECOGNIZING COLONEL JOHN BATTISTA AIROLA, USMC, RETIRED, WITH A 
                   CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN COMMENDATION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PETE SESSIONS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present retired USMC 
Colonel John Battista Airola, of Huntsville, Texas, with a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation. His servant&#x27;s life reflects the 
hard work and dedication that exemplifies the best of our Nation&#x27;s 
values.
  Colonel Airola entered active duty at Quantico, Virginia in August of 
1955 at twenty-one years of age and served with honor and heroism 
during the Vietnam War with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions of the 
Marine Corps. His service instilled not only a sense of pride in his 
four children but led them all to the call of duty serving as officers 
in multiple branches of our Nation&#x27;s military.
  Colonel Airola served 9 years in foreign service to our Nation with 
significant combat earning the following; Vietnam Service Medal with 2 
Stars, Bronze Star Medal with combat V, National Defense Service Medal, 
Navy Unit Commendation, Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit 
Citation, Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with palm, Vietnam Campaign Medal 
with device, Navy Commendation Medal, Meritorious Unit Commendation, 
Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Pistol Expert (15th Award), Rifle 
Sharpshooter and Legion of Merit dated May 4, 1987.
  Throughout his distinguished military career, he completed Recruit 
Training in 1955, then moved on into Infantry Combat Training later 
that year. In 1956, he completed the ANGLICO Basic Course (ABC) 
followed by Officer Candidate School and subsequent Basic School in 
1957. Carrying on with additional training, he completed Duties of a 
Motor Transport (MT) Officer and Embarkation Duties in 1958. By 1965, 
he completed additional training that included Jr. Landing Force Plan 
Staff II and Nuclear Weapons Orientation. As the war in Vietnam heated 
up, he completed Amphibious Warfare training in 1968 and the Senior 
Officer Preventative Maintenance Course by 1972 and later the 
Instructors Orientation Course in 1975.
  After his 32-year career in the Marine Corps, Colonel Airola 
transitioned his service over to the HEARTS Veterans Museum from its 
inception. His countless hours of volunteering, setting up museum 
displays, participating in parades, and educating the visitors and 
children is nothing short of amazing. Up until the summer of 2025, at 
the age of 91, John came in to volunteer every Saturday and even when 
he couldn&#x27;t attend regularly, he still financially supported the 
mission of HEARTS.
  Colonel Airola is an exceptional candidate for this Commendation. His 
leadership is paramount and has furthered the mission of HEARTS Museum 
over the years by starting the local Marine Corps Birthday Celebration 
each year, helped foster the early days of HEARTS and served on its 
board of directors for many years advocating for his fellow veterans in 
addition to his support for the local Marine Corps League, Toys for 
Tots and Semper Fi Fund. It is this advocacy and impact which lead him 
to be tapped to serve on the inaugural Congressional Veterans 
Commendation committee for East Texas.
  Colonel Airola has made it his mission to continue to educate our 
visitors and the children about the pride in service to our country and 
our Nation&#x27;s military history. The Colonel is history; the Colonel is 
an exceptional American Soldier. It is with this level of love of 
country and his beloved United States Marine Corps and all of its glory 
and strength that I proudly commend retired USMC Colonel John Battista 
Airola of Huntsville, Texas to his friends, family, and colleagues, and 
salute his service to the Marines, his country and Walker County by 
awarding him the 2025 Congressional Veteran Commendation.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PETE SESSIONS

                                of texas

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Delman 
Leon Orme of Crockett, Texas, as a distinguished recipient of the 
Congressional Veteran Commendation. His servant&#x27;s life reflects the 
hard work and dedication that exemplifies the best of our Nation&#x27;s 
values.
  Delman answered the call to service when he enlisted in the United 
States Army in March 1989, right out of high school. He followed in his 
older brothers&#x27; footsteps, one serving as a Military Police Officer and 
the other as a Combat Engineer. He entered as a Delta 19, which meant 
riding motorcycles. He served in the Scout Platoon, 4th Battalion, 64th 
Armor during Operation Desert Storm displaying outstanding tactical and 
technical skills. His proficiency enabled the Scout Platoon to quickly 
in advance friendly forces so the enemy could be destroyed while 
displaying high morale and a cool demeanor. During his tenure, he 
served with courage and distinction, embodying the highest standards of 
military excellence. His bravery and leadership in combat were 
recognized through numerous awards, including the Purple Heart, the 
Bronze Star Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Good Conduct 
Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the National Defense Service 
Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon.
  The Purple Heart is a solemn testament to his sacrifice in defense of 
our freedom, having been wounded in action while serving his country. 
The Bronze Star Medal further attests to his heroic or meritorious 
achievement in a combat zone, an enduring reflection of his courage 
under fire and commitment to mission and comrades alike. Delman doesn&#x27;t 
consider himself a hero but credits the men that would not quit until 
he was safely off the battlefield. They provided protection and care 
and were amazingly able to get a helicopter in after three attempts. 
This was all on the last day of the war and fortunately, because he got 
shot, the battalion behind was able to make an overwhelming 
counterattack, which led to total victory. Had he not been discharged, 
he would have made a career out of serving his country.
  Following his honorable discharge in August 1991, Delman continued 
his life of service at home. In his community of Crockett, he has 
remained steadfast in supporting fellow veterans and contributing to 
civic life. He is well respected by both the community and his peers 
for his hard work and dedication. While he does not volunteer in 
specific structured organizations, whenever there is a need in his 
community, he is the first to not only volunteer, but to take 
initiative when he sees a community need. He spends many hours 
volunteering on the weekends maintaining cemeteries and managing the 
landscape downtown and has also spent many hours assisting with 
hurricane disaster relief. He enjoys helping others and can&#x27;t say no 
when asked for help.
  Delman&#x27;s story reflects the unwavering spirit of America&#x27;s veterans, 
men and women who not only fought for freedom abroad but who continue 
to strengthen the fabric of our Nation here at home.
  It is my distinct privilege to recognize Delman Leon Orme for his 
exceptional service to the United States of America and his enduring 
contributions to the people of East Texas. His devotion to both country 
and community stands as a shining example of patriotism and selfless 
service.

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor William 
``Bud&#x27;&#x27; Starker for his years of public service and dedication to the 
City of Wheat Ridge.
  As a more than fifty year resident of Wheat Ridge, Mayor Starker has 
long been a pillar of the community. As both a city councilor and a 
mayor, Mayor Starker has guided the City with steady leadership, 
including navigating the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 
pandemic and championing efforts to expand housing affordability in 
Jefferson County and across the State of Colorado.
  Beyond City Hall, Mayor Starker has promoted economic development 
throughout the Denver Metro Area through his work in the private 
sector. Through Starker Construction, he helped build more than 100 
restaurants, including transforming an older property in his 
neighborhood into West 29th Restaurant and Bar--a beloved local 
gathering place that stands as a quintessential example of his 
commitment to revitalizing our community.
  On behalf of the people of Colorado&#x27;s 7th Congressional District, it 
is my honor to thank Mayor Bud Starker for his years of service and 
wish him the best in all his future endeavors.

                        Friday, October 17, 2025

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present Nola Jane Saldana 
of Waco, Texas, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation. Nola Saldana 
is a proud United States Navy veteran, who served nearly 10 years and 
continues to dedicate her life to supporting veterans and her 
community. A full-blooded Maidu Indian raised in poverty on a 
reservation in Susanville, California, she grew up with strong values 
of respect and kindness, taught by her mother.
  Not long after graduating from Sherman Indian High School, a boarding 
school in Riverside, California, Nola joined the Navy in January 1988. 
She trained as a welder and served aboard the USS Acadia, and later the 
USS Dixon as a radiation worker, often as the only woman in her 
division. Her service took her across the world, including to the 
Persian Gulf and multiple international ports. She departed the Navy in 
1997. During her service she earned the National Defense Service Medal, 
Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Sea Service Medal Deployment Ribbon 
three times, and the Good Conduct Medal two times.
  Following her military career, she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 
social work with honors from Texas Tech University. She went on to 
serve in several public service roles in Waco, Texas, including at the 
Texas Youth Commission, Texas Behavioral Health Network, and Child 
Protective Services. Since 2007, she has worked at the Waco VA Medical 
Center as a Mental Health Caseworker for seriously mentally ill women 
Veterans.
  Beyond her professional work, Nola leads numerous Veteran-focused 
programs as Commander of VFW Post 2148 and volunteers in the community. 
She supports troop care packages, family assistance, welcome-home 
events, Veteran services, youth scholarships, and JROTC programs. She 
is also a member of the Honor Guard and an adult volunteer with the 
Waco Young Marines.
  Recently, she made history as the first Native American female 
Commander of VFW District 29, overseeing seven posts in Texas. Nola is 
also a proud mother of four successful children, all of whom have 
pursued higher education or military service. Nola Saldana exemplifies 
lifelong service, leadership, and dedication to others. It is with 
great honor and respect that I present Nola Jane Saldana with a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation from the 17th Congressional District 
of Texas.
