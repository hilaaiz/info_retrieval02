                        ALL VETERANS HONOR GUARD

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. KEN BUCK

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the All 
Veterans Honor Guard, who provide the final Military Honors at Fort 
Logan National Cemetery in Colorado. Only those who have served in the 
U.S. Armed Forces are permitted to provide such services but in 1993, 
the U.S. Military ceased to perform these final rites for deceased 
veterans.
  That&#x27;s why approximately 100 Colorado veterans formed the All 
Veterans Honor Guard in 1994 to carry on this sacred duty for their 
late comrades in arms. Aside from a small stipend from the state of 
Colorado, the organization receives no additional funding or 
compensation to maintain and repair the World War II-era weapons or to 
purchase uniforms for their volunteers.
  During their first year, the All Veterans Honor Guard provided 
Military Honors for 63 veterans at Ft. Logan National Cemetery--and 
since 1994, they have stood as the Honor Guard for over 23,400 military 
funerals; with Chief Master Sergeant Retired Morris Smith serving as 
the backbone for over two decades. But as time has gone on, the number 
of requests for their services has grown as our aging veterans pass 
away. The number of volunteers, however, has diminished. In 2021, the 
All Veterans Honor Guard had less than 80 veteran volunteers, who 
provided the final honors for 1,554 veterans.
  Despite these challenges, the Honor Guard remains as dedicated to 
serving their late brothers and sisters in their afterlife as they were 
in serving alongside them in life. That is why, Mr. Speaker Pro 
Tempore, on behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Colorado, it is 
a distinct privilege to recognize and commemorate the tireless efforts 
of the All Veterans Honor Guard over the past 29 years. Our country is 
blessed to have such heroes who care enough to honor their comrades as 
they are laid to rest.

  COMMEMORATING COOK COUNTY BOARD&#x27;S ``MEDICAL DEBT RELIEF INITIATIVE&#x27;&#x27;

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I wish to recognize the 
transformative ``Medical Debt Relief Initiative&#x27;&#x27; in Cook County, 
Illinois which has successfully abolished $281,338,840 of medical debt 
for Cook County residents. I applaud the tireless efforts of Cook 
County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and the Cook County Board to 
provide much needed relief to 158,541 residents. This innovative 
program, in partnership with the national nonprofit ``RIP Medical 
Debt,&#x27;&#x27; reallocated $12 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds to 
provide invaluable relief to Cook County families, many of whom are 
living paycheck to paycheck.
  Medical debt continues to be a crisis in our country. According to 
``RIP Medical Debt,&#x27;&#x27; every day, 1 in 2 Americans must choose between 
paying medical bills and covering their basic needs. This is 
unacceptable. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, more Americans 
have health insurance coverage now than ever before, but despite these 
historic strides, costs remain a barrier to accessing high-quality 
healthcare. Low and moderate-income American households continue to 
accrue medical debt and continue to be harmed by its financial and 
mental effects.
  During a time of rising costs, Congress must do its part to assist 
working families. We must seek bipartisan solutions to reform our 
healthcare system because no one should be punished for becoming sick 
or receiving medical care. While we seek bipartisan policy solutions, 
partnerships across all levels of government should continue to 
facilitate medical debt relief. This relief, such as the ``Medical Debt 
Relief Initiative&#x27;&#x27; in Cook County, Illinois, has the power to give 
economic mobility to working families and boost our economy. Mr. 
Speaker Pro Tempore, I extend immense gratitude to the Cook County 
Board, under the direction of Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle, 
for being a model for other jurisdictions across the country. I 
continue to seek opportunities to advance commonsense models like this 
one to address the medical debt crisis.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in recognition of 
Mark Pelletier, a New Hampshire resident who was recently named the 
2023 Young Professional of the Year by the Cooperative Credit Union 
Association. The Cooperative Credit Union Association annual awards 
recognize individuals across Delaware, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and 
New Hampshire that make the extra effort to empower their coworkers, 
company, and community. As the Young Professional of the Year, Mark has 
been recognized for his experience, enthusiasm, and strong work ethic 
at St. Mary&#x27;s Bank in Manchester.
  A senior data analyst lead for St. Mary&#x27;s, Mark was nominated by the 
credit union&#x27;s leadership team and employees because of his inclusive 
leadership style, his skills in devising data-driven solutions, and his 
extensive volunteer record. For the past two years, Mark has served as 
Chairperson of St. Mary&#x27;s Young Professionals Group. In this role, Mark 
has taken to guiding, influencing, and supporting other young 
professionals. Mark&#x27;s time as leader of this Group is a testament to 
his talent and passion for promoting young business leaders across New 
Hampshire.
  Outside of the office, Mark has committed himself to addressing the 
needs of his community. In his free time, Mark volunteers with 
organizations such as Families in Transition and Habitat for Humanity. 
Dedicated to empowering young leaders and committed to supporting the 
local community, Mark has enriched the lives of all those around him.
  I look forward to seeing all that Mark accomplishes in the years to 
come, and I am confident that he will continue to serve as a guide for 
all those looking to make a difference at their workplace and in their 
community. On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire&#x27;s First 
Congressional District, I applaud Mark for his commendable leadership 
and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.

             HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SAMANTHA WOLL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr, Speaker Pro Tempore, it is with profound grief that 
I pay tribute to the life of a passionate advocate, a dedicated former 
Congressional staff member, an organizer, and a true believer in 
interfaith dialogue, Samantha Woll. Sam had a brilliant mind, a 
generous spirit, and was a true light in the community. While we do not 
yet know the circumstances of her death, we do know how she lived, so 
today I ask that we remember the profound impact she had on her 
community, our state, and the Nation in her short time on this earth.

[[Page E1007]]

  Sam worked for me from nearly the moment I became a Congresswoman--
helping us set up the Lansing office in 2019 and helping to lead it for 
my full first term as Team Slotkin&#x27;s Deputy District Director. Like 
everyone who met her, I was immediately struck by her kindness, her 
sharp mind, and her ever-present smile. Though she was young, Sam came 
to our team already well-established, having worked for multiple 
members of the state legislature, as well as many different causes 
close to her heart. She would go on to work for Michigan Attorney 
General Dana Nessel and State Senator Stephanie Chang, among others.
  I was also struck by her profound faith; not just her personal faith 
in Judaism, but her profound faith in humanity. Sam dedicated her time 
on my staff, and truly her entire life, to building understanding and 
bridges between people, and bringing light in the face of darkness. She 
helped establish our first interfaith roundtable and continued that 
work when she left our office, serving as president of the Isaac Agree 
Synagogue in Detroit where she was known for her outreach and dialogue 
with her Muslim and Christian neighbors. As the Detroit Jewish News 
noted in naming her one of the ``36 Under 36&#x27;&#x27; influential young people 
in the Jewish community, ``By extending her hand and creating space for 
connection between Muslims and Jews, she has exemplified the values of 
healing the world.&#x27;&#x27; She also played a vital role in the revitalization 
of Detroit, including the renovation and reopening of her historic 
synagogue just a few months ago. It is deeply painful that we have lost 
someone so dedicated to healing, and connecting so many people, no 
matter their background, to such a destructive act.
  Sam&#x27;s senseless death has left a hole not just in our hearts but in 
the fabric of our community. She was a beacon of light and I ask that 
as we grieve her loss, we recommit ourselves to the principles by which 
she lived. Sam firmly believed in the power of government to do good: 
to lift people out of poverty, to give a voice to the voiceless, and to 
bring justice and equality to all. She was deeply committed to the idea 
that what united us as Americans and Michiganders was much more 
important than the ways some try to divide us. I send my deepest 
condolences to all who knew and loved her. May her memory be a blessing 
forever in our hearts.

  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is my honor today to recognize 
the accomplishments of three outstanding women. Ashley Ferris, Yvette 
Marquez-Sharpnack and Alice Jackson who will be honored by the 
Northwest Douglas County Chamber &amp; Economic Development Corporation as 
``Women Who Soar.&#x27;&#x27;
  Ashley Ferris, a law enforcement officer, left an indelible mark in 
Denver from 2018 to 2023. Even before her tenure as a dedicated law 
enforcement officer, her background as a United States Army 
Intelligence Analyst and project manager showcased her remarkable 
skills.
  Ashley&#x27;s heroic efforts were exemplified during the critical incident 
on December 27, 2021,

[[Page E1006]]

where she confronted and took down the Lakewood, CO mass shooter, 
despite sustaining injuries herself. This act of bravery earned her 
accolades, including the Law Enforcement Officer of the Year 2022 by 
the National Police Hall of Fame and the Valor Award. Her unwavering 
determination and resilience, even in the face of adversity, make her 
an inspiration.
  Yvette Marquez-Sharpnack, a celebrated cookbook author and Emmy 
Award-winning creator and chef, blends her Texan roots into culinary 
masterpieces. Drawing inspiration from her grandmother&#x27;s Mexican 
traditions and her mother&#x27;s home-style dishes, she crafts delectable 
creations showcased on MuyBuenoBlog.com. Besides her blog, Yvette, 
based in Colorado, is a sought-after brand ambassador and recipe 
developer, engaging her audience on social media.
  Alice Jackson is a trailblazer in the energy sector, shining as Xcel 
Energy&#x27;s Senior Vice President of System Strategy and Chief Planning 
Officer. Her leadership in this male-dominated field has been 
transformative. With a decade of contributions, Alice has redefined the 
standards of excellence in executive leadership. Her success story is 
not just inspiring but a testament to her resilience, making her an 
inspiration for aspiring professionals in the industry.
  From saving lives during a mass shooting to Emmy winning inspiration, 
this year&#x27;s recipients have made a lasting impact on those around them 
and in our community. It is leaders like these women who will allow us 
to achieve a more prosperous and inclusive future and I congratulate 
them all on being recognized as ``Women Who Soar.&#x27;&#x27;

 RECOGNIZING CARLA SCRUGGS&#x27; 32+ YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE CITY OF SALINE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize 
Carla Scruggs, the Director of Parks and Recreation for the City of 
Saline, on the occasion of her retirement. Her contributions to the 
health and wellness of the Saline community over the last three decades 
are worthy of commendation.
  Born and raised in Ann Arbor, MI, Carla graduated from Pioneer High 
School before attending Central Michigan University, where she spent 
four years on the softball team. After earning both her bachelor&#x27;s and 
master&#x27;s degrees, she set out on a career in public service throughout 
Southeastern Michigan. In 1988, Carla began at the City of Hazel Park 
as a graduate intern specializing in senior programming and youth and 
adult sports. She then went to Novi, where she took on the position of 
Recreation Coordinator for the city&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department. 
In 1991, Carla was brought on as the Director of Parks and Recreation 
for the City of Saline, where she has been serving ever since.
  Carla&#x27;s tenure at the head of the Saline Parks and Recreation 
Department has seen countless improvements to Saline&#x27;s green spaces. 
These include, but are certainly not limited to, the Recreate Our Mill 
Pond Park play structure, multiple dog parks, and the creation of Salt 
Springs Park. As well as being the Director, Carla also acts as the 
Staff Liaison to the Parks Commission and the Youth Council. She has 
been an active member for the Michigan Recreation and Parks Association 
for the entirety of her tenure and is currently the Chair of their 
Awards Committee. In her free time, Carla volunteers every year for the 
Punt Pass &amp; Kick State Competition, Saline&#x27;s DARE golf outing, the PPSA 
golf outing, and the University of Michigan Softball Academy to raise 
awareness for breast cancer.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in 
celebrating the 32+ years of public service that Carla Scruggs has been 
kind enough to dedicate her life to. She has given our children spaces 
to play, our dogs spaces to run, and altogether has made Saline a 
warmer and more welcoming place to live. Though we are sad to see her 
go, the families of Saline will be feeling her positive influence for 
decades to come. I thank Carla.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the life 
of Dr. Fred Luther Haynes, who passed away on September 2, 2023, and to 
thank him for his more than 40 years of dedicated service to the 
Bakersfield City School District. Dr. Haynes was born in Clarksville, 
Oklahoma to Harvey Haynes and Mable Haynes-Harvey. He was the eldest of 
five sons. At an early age, his mother instilled in him the value of 
education, which inspired him to become an educator. He attended 
college at Langston University in Oklahoma, where he received his 
bachelor of science degree in education. Dr. Haynes pursued his post-
graduate studies at Fisk University in Tennessee, where he obtained his 
master&#x27;s degree in education. Over the course of his career, he earned 
additional credentials and teaching certificates at the California 
State University of Fresno and Bakersfield, Florida Agricultural and 
Mechanical University, and Dillard University. In 1977, Dr. Haynes 
attended Brigham Young University, where he received a doctorate in 
education.
  In 1951, Dr. Haynes married Marcy Alice Williams in Tulsa, where they 
would start their family of eight children. Ten years later, he moved 
his family to Bakersfield, California, where he began his extensive 
teaching career in the Bakersfield City School District (BCSD). Dr. 
Haynes was first a teacher at Colonel Baker School before becoming the 
school&#x27;s Assistant Principal. He later moved to the district office, 
where he worked as a Resource Teacher and became BCSD&#x27;s first African 
American district-wide supervisor. During his time as supervisor, Dr. 
Haynes was focused on parental involvement, even creating the Parent 
Involvement and Community Relation Division to strengthen the 
relationship between students, parents, and teachers at BCSD. For 26 
years, Dr. Haynes served as Principal across multiple BCSD elementary 
schools and at Emerson Jr. High School. Throughout his tenure as 
Principal, Dr. Haynes was dedicated to the achievement of all students 
and was instrumental in district-wide changes that supported 
underrepresented students.
  In 1996, the Dr. Fred Haynes Award was established to honor the 
leadership, strength, and courage displayed by Dr. Haynes over the 
course of his career. Each year, the award is given to male students in 
the district who exhibit the qualities of Dr. Haynes in their academic 
pursuits. In 2016, Dr. Haynes was inducted into the BCSD&#x27;s Hall of 
Fame, to honor him for his 40 years of exceptional service to the 
district. After his retirement, Dr. Haynes became a Board Member for 
BCSD, a position he held until 2020. As a member of the board, he 
continued to advocate for the well-being and success of students in the 
district.
  Outside of the classroom, Dr. Haynes was passionate about the lives 
of members of the community. He was the author of African American 
Women Trailblazer, which celebrates the sacrifices and achievements of 
African American women in Kern County. He received several awards to 
honor his service, including awards from the NAACP, Boy Scouts of 
America, and the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask all my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible life of Dr. Fred 
Luther Haynes. Dr. Haynes&#x27; lifetime of service as an educator in the 
Central Valley will be felt for generations to come.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to congratulate 
Shakopee Brewhall--Taproom &amp; Coffeehouse as the Midwest regional 
finalist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s America&#x27;s Top Small 
Business Award.
  Shakopee Brewhall was selected as one of seven finalists out of a 
total of over 15,000 small business applicants for the annual Top Small 
Business Award. At its inception in 2018, the brewhall operated 
modestly with a nine-member team, opening its doors for just 41 hours 
across five days each week. During that time, the team focused on 
brewing and, as demand grew, distributing its unique beers. Today, they 
employ 27 workers, with over half of the original staff still remaining 
on the team and have grown their customer base and expanded their 
offerings to include morning coffee and espresso over 86 hours every 
week.
  I&#x27;m grateful for co-founders, Ryan Lindquist and Damon Schuler&#x27;s role 
in the revitalization of downtown Shakopee by turning their historic 
space into Scott County&#x27;s first taproom and coffeehouse. Their 
leadership of the brewhall showcased necessary innovation when pivoting 
to distribution during the pandemic and working with other local small 
businesses. I&#x27;ve also appreciated their ``Share More Than A Beer Day,&#x27;&#x27; 
which creates awareness and financial support for partnering 
organizations and has led to more than $50,000 in donations to local 
non-profits.
  It was a special honor to join Shakopee Brewhall&#x27;s Caitlin Drayna at 
the Chamber&#x27;s Awards Gala on October 19th. It is my privilege to 
represent Shakopee Brewhall in Congress and I look forward to sharing a 
beer together soon.

       RECOGNIZING THE 32ND ANNIVERSARY OF PARIS PEACE AGREEMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. LORI TRAHAN

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in recognition of 
the 32nd Anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement that ended the 
Cambodian-Vietnamese War. As the Chair of the Congressional Cambodia 
Caucus and the Representative of a district with one of the highest 
populations of Cambodian-Americans, I rise to honor the anniversary of 
the peace agreement and call on the United States to do everything 
possible to help Cambodia realize its full democratic potential.
  This historic agreement ended a horrible war that stretched over 
three decades and caused the deaths of countless soldiers and 
civilians. One of the promises outlined in the accord was for free and 
fair elections. Unfortunately, that aspiration was never realized, and 
the current state of Cambodia&#x27;s government personifies the challenges 
that remain to achieving a truly democratic nation.
  For thirty-eight years, Cambodia was ruled with an iron grip by Prime 
Minister Hun Sen. The democratic promise of free and fair elections was 
shattered by his weaponization of government power. Over the years, Hun 
Sen took steps to eliminate his opposition, ban independent media 
outlets, and jail peaceful protesters. In depriving the Cambodian 
people of their human rights, Hun Sen moved Cambodia closer to an 
authoritarian state and robbed them of the representative government 
promised in their Constitution and the Paris Peace Agreement.

[[Page E1009]]

  Earlier this year, Cambodia held a sham election that made a mockery 
of the democratic process. The prearranged result saw a landslide 
victory for Hun Sen who in turn announced an immediate transfer of 
power to his son, Hun Manet. Let me be clear, these most recent 
elections violated the Cambodian Constitution, a document that Hun Sen 
helped draft and signed three decades ago, and his unprecedented 
decision to unilaterally transfer power to his son indicates Cambodia 
will be subject to authoritarian rule for another generation.
  As we recognize the 32nd anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement, 
the Congressional Cambodia Caucus stands firmly against the rising tide 
of authoritarianism in Cambodia. We will not stand idly by while Hun 
Manet picks up where his father left off. Instead, we will continue to 
use every tool at our disposal to push for a free, democratic Cambodia. 
I am a proud co-lead of the Cambodian Democracy and Human Rights Act 
(H.R. 4659), legislation that promotes free and fair elections, 
democracy, political freedoms, and human rights in Cambodia by applying 
sanctions on Cambodian officials who denigrate those rights. I look 
forward to working with my colleagues in the Cambodian Caucus to pass 
this bill and with the Biden Administration to ensure that these 
sanctions are imposed effectively.
  Passing the Cambodian Democracy and Human Rights Act will help ensure 
that the principles of the Paris Peace Agreement are upheld and that 
Cambodians can move closer to achieving the self-determination and 
dignity they deserve.

  RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 100 YEARS OF THE BETTER BUSINESS 
                       BUREAU OF UPSTATE NEW YORK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I am honored 
to recognize the Better Business Bureau of Upstate New York as they 
celebrate a century of dedicated service to our community. 
Headquartered in Amherst, NY, this organization, and their staff have 
undoubtedly had a lasting impact on countless constituents in Western 
New York.
  Founded in 1923, the reach and growth of this chapter of the Better 
Business Bureau is nothing short of impressive. The eighth largest 
Better Business Bureau, it serves 6 million people across 48 counties 
in New York State. Due to their unwavering enthusiasm, BBB of Upstate 
New York closes 15,000 complaints annually while posting over 10,000 
reviews. Throughout their long history, millions of service-oriented 
tasks have been completed in the name of consumer education and 
standards enforcement. Their mission is simple: provide consumers with 
resources to not only avoid dishonest business practices but offer 
remedies for those who have been wronged. Very importantly, all levels 
of government rely on BBB of Upstate New York to front-end this 
education of consumers. Federal, state, and local law enforcement have 
also been able to begin investigations (and ultimately prosecutions) of 
bad faith actors in our local marketplace. That type of responsibility 
is only given because the Better Business Bureau of Upstate New York 
has proven to be an honest broker for consumers.
  Trust is at the very core of business, and it is only due to 
organizations like the Better Business Bureau of Upstate New York that 
consumers can approach matters with confidence. I applaud their century 
of work to better our community, and I wish them continued expansion 
and prosperity in aiding the men and women of our community.

                 RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF ROBERT H. LIPP

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I am honored 
to recognize the life of a quintessential West Side of Buffalo 
resident, Robert Lipp. Often referred to as ``The Mayor of Fifteenth 
Street,&#x27;&#x27; Robert left an indelible mark on a community that will be 
mourning his loss for a long time to come.
  Born in 1965, Robert graduated from Maryvale High School in 
Cheektowaga, and Bryant &amp; Stratton College in Buffalo, where he 
obtained a degree in Electronic Technology. A longtime employee with 
the New York State Thruway Authority, an on-the-job accident meant that 
Robert entered retirement earlier than he had planned. Instead of 
approaching this situation with negativity, Robert began to dive into 
some of his passions. As a man that understood the value of community 
and neighborhoods, he would plant flowers each year for Buffalo&#x27;s 
annual Garden Walk. Robert did not simply hope that someone would take 
steps to beautify the West Side of Buffalo; he did it. Whether it 
result from confrontation of absentee landlords or fixing the 
electrical issues of his neighbors, there was no limit to the level of 
love that Robert displayed for the City of Buffalo.
  Of course, Robert enjoyed many other activities, as well. He loved to 
camp, go to concerts and weddings, and (in typical Buffalo fashion) 
watch his beloved Bills and Sabres. He spent time with his many dogs, 
sought to make each year&#x27;s Garden Walk better than the last, and served 
as a dedicated member of the Democratic Committee.
  Survived by his husband, Bobby Graber, and countless loving family 
members, Robert&#x27;s sudden passing will undoubtedly be difficult to 
endure. Nevertheless, to all of those who knew and loved Robert, his 
legacy will remain. Robert served as a model citizen in so many ways, 
and our community will forever be a better place because of him.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize 
Mrs. Cindy Castello for the vital role she has played in the 
development of Cherokee County, Georgia as a stronghold of conservative 
values.
  Cindy and her husband, Pete, have been friends of my family for many 
years. We have witnessed her character and dedication to our shared 
cause in all of her numerous roles as a community servant. As a 
dedicated leader, Cindy has been instrumental in recruiting and 
developing many community activists to become public servants and run 
for public office. She has utilized her extensive network of 
relationships and years of experience within the Georgia Republican 
Party, the 11th Congressional District, and the Cherokee County 
Republican Party to lay a foundation which will impact Cherokee County 
for years to come.
  She has devoted countless hours volunteering her time, talents, and 
energy to serve eleven years on the Zoning Board of Appeals; and, 
during her eighteen years of service on the Tax Equalization Board, she 
played a vital role for Cherokee County in steering the future of the 
county by applying commonsense conservative values.
  In her thirty-three years of dedicated service on the Cherokee County 
Board of Elections, Cindy has helped to set a standard of excellence, 
and helped develop the Board into one of Georgia&#x27;s finest and most 
innovative entities.
  She has provided invaluable support and has been instrumental in the 
development of the Cherokee County Republican Party for the past forty 
years. She exemplifies the very best of public service and is truly an 
inspiration to so many. It is abundantly fitting and proper that 
Cindy&#x27;s dedication to the cause of faith, family, and freedom be 
appropriately recognized in the U.S. House of Representatives.
  On behalf of the citizens of Cherokee County, Georgia&#x27;s 11th 
Congressional District, and myself and my family, I offer my sincere 
appreciation to Mrs. Cindy Castello for her decades of faithful public 
service to our community.

                         TRIBUTE TO OPTUS BANK

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 24, 2023

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a distinguished South Carolina bank for its unwavering commitment to 
advancing minority-owned businesses. Optus Bank of Columbia, South 
Carolina was recently awarded the Minority Business Development Agency 
(MBDA) 2023 Robert J. Brown Minority Business Enterprise of the Year 
Award. Their steadfast support of businesses in distressed areas has 
uplifted communities and the lives of many.
  To recognize the important role of entrepreneurs and institutions in 
advancing minority-owned businesses, the Minority Business Development 
Agency at the United States Department of Commerce established Minority 
Enterprise Development Week in 1983. Since then, the Department of 
Commerce has commenced numerous awards to celebrate the outstanding 
achievements of minority entrepreneurs. The Robert J. Brown Minority 
Business Enterprise Award recognizes companies that have exceeded 
industry standards and achieved phenomenal financial success while 
showing a commitment to social responsibility and strong community 
involvement. The award is among the highest levels of recognition that 
a U.S. minority business enterprise can receive from the U.S. 
Department of Commerce.
  Optus Bank was selected because of its commitment to closing the 
racial wealth gap, exacerbated by systemic disparities in the financial 
industry. Following in the footsteps of Victory Savings Bank, the first 
Black-owned bank in South Carolina, Optus is committed to providing 
access to capital to individuals and businesses excluded from the 
banking system. By turning deposits from community members into loans 
that serve local businesses, Optus provides funding for enterprises 
that may not be approved for traditional loans. Their unique community 
driven mission has allowed them to achieve great success while helping 
scores of minority-owned enterprises succeed in South Carolina.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in 
celebrating Optus Bank and their unwavering commitment to serving 
communities and people in need. Their actions should serve as an 
example to other organizations dedicated to positively impacting the 
communities they operate in. South Carolina is more prosperous because 
of the efforts of Optus Bank and I wish them continued success.
