              APPRECIATION OF THE SERVICE OF WILL NEITZEL

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BRYAN STEIL

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Will Neitzel, 
a member of my staff for the last five and a half years. Will joined my 
team as I opened a new office and started my first term, serving 
Wisconsin&#x27;s First Congressional District. Will has been an integral 
member of my team.
  While serving in my personal office, Will&#x27;s candor, hard work, and 
humor have been tremendous assets to my office. When first starting my 
office, Will was essential in getting my mail program up and running, 
working tirelessly to produce dozens of letters each week. As a policy 
staffer Will helped Wisconsin families and small businesses better 
understand and navigate federal programs.
  After serving as one of my lead staffers in my personal office, Will 
then moved to the Committee on House Administration when I became 
Chairman in January of 2022. Will quickly became my Wisconsin advocate 
with the Committee, always thinking of ways House Administration can 
benefit the people of Wisconsin&#x27;s First District. Will also jumped 
right in and helped lead the Committee&#x27;s widely successful ``Running an 
Effective Committee in the Majority Series&#x27;&#x27;, ``Level Up: GOP Staff 
Development Course&#x27;&#x27;, and the ``Intern Lecture Series&#x27;&#x27;, among many 
others.
  With Will as a part of my Member Services team, the Committee has 
held briefings and education trainings for over 2,000 Members of 
Congress and their staff. This team has also successfully completed 
over 600 Member-related requests. Will also spearheaded the planting of 
the Sugar Maple tree on the U.S. Capitol Grounds commemorating the 
175th anniversary of the State of Wisconsin.
  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt in my mind that the great people of 
Wisconsin are better off because of Will&#x27;s service here in the U.S. 
House of Representatives. I&#x27;m so appreciative to have had him in my 
personal and committee offices. On behalf of my personal office and the 
Committee on House Administration, we want to thank Will for his great 
services and friendship. We wish the very best of success to Will, 
Steph, Jack, and Ada as they start a new chapter back home in 
Wisconsin.

                                 ______

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 100th anniversary 
of the Escontrias STEAM Academy, a cornerstone of educational 
excellence in the Lower Valley of El Paso County.
  In 1921, faced with the urgent need for a safe educational 
environment for children of the Socorro district, Silverio Escontrias, 
a dedicated Texas Ranger and community leader, generously donated land 
at U.S. Highway 80 and Buford Road for a new school. His commitment to 
education laid the groundwork for what would become Escontrias 
Elementary

[[Page E559]]

School and later, Escontrias STEAM (Science, technology, engineering, 
art and math) Academy.
  Notably, in 1924, the academy initiated a vocational program, 
teaching practical skills like carpentry, cotton farming, and animal 
husbandry, exemplifying the academy&#x27;s commitment to a holistic 
education, preparing students for both academic and practical success 
in life. Since then, the Escontrias STEAM Academy has evolved into a 
hub of innovation. From its humble beginnings in adobe structures to 
its current status as a leading institution for STEAM education, the 
academy has remained steadfast in its mission to provide innovative 
learning opportunities.
  As we commemorate its centennial milestone, we remain committed to 
ensuring that every child, regardless of background or circumstance, 
has access to the transformative power of education. The legacy of 
Escontrias STEAM Academy serves as a beacon of hope and opportunity for 
generations to come.
  Today, I am honored to pay tribute to the Escontrias STEAM Academy 
for its century of educational excellence and its profound impact on 
the lives of countless students, families, and the broader community.

         CELEBRATING THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the City of Ann 
Arbor on the 200th anniversary of its founding. The contributions its 
residents have made to the State of Michigan and to the Nation over the 
last two centuries are worthy of commendation.
  Originally the Village of Annarbour, this community was named after 
the wives of its two founders, who were both named Ann, and was also 
inspired by the large forest in the area. Founded in 1824, historic Ann 
Arbor predates the establishment of the State of Michigan by thirteen 
years.
  Ann Arbor is home to one of the most prestigious universities in the 
world: The University of Michigan. The University of Michigan was 
originally established in 1817 as Catholepistemiad Michigania in 
Detroit, then a fledgling capital of the Territory of Michigan, and 
later relocated to Ann Arbor in 1837. Since its founding, the 
university has brought defining cultural, economic, and intellectual 
growth to greater Ann Arbor. The students, staff, and faculty come from 
all 50 American states and over 100 countries globally, contributing to 
the worldly and diverse culture of this community. In addition to its 
numerous accolades for its academic prestige, University of Michigan 
Athletics continues to make Ann Arbor proud. Just this past January, 
the University of Michigan Football Team defeated the Washington 
Huskies, bringing a national championship title back to Ann Arbor for 
the first time since 1997.
  It is not just the University of Michigan that makes Ann Arbor 
special. The cultural and religious diversity of the city has been a 
source of strength and has also led to Ann Arbor being the site of many 
monumental political and civil rights activities. From traditional 
denominations to more contemporary organizations, there is something 
for everyone in this vibrant city. Beth Israel, one of the oldest 
synagogues in the state, was founded in 1916. The city was also the 
home of the first meetings of the Students for a Democratic Society in 
1960, a national student activist group. That same year, President John 
F. Kennedy set in motion the development of the Peace Corps on the 
steps of the Michigan Union. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson gave 
his ``Great Society&#x27;&#x27; speech at the University of Michigan&#x27;s 
commencement. In 1965, the city was the location of the first American 
``teach in&#x27;&#x27; in protest of the Vietnam War.
  Ann Arbor has long been known as a hotbed for technological 
innovation and start-ups. The International Radio Corporation, 
established in Ann Arbor in 1931, was responsible for the first mass-
produced AC/DC radio as well as the Argus C3, one of the top-selling 
cameras in history. ProQuest, founded in 1938 as University Microfilms, 
has been at the forefront of the preservation of documents for research 
purposes since their founding. Thomas Knoll, an Ann Arbor native, 
created Adobe Photoshop in 1987 while completing his Ph.D. at the 
University of Michigan. Duo Security, a leader in two-factor internet 
security, was founded in 2009. Presently, Ann Arbor is host to over 20 
video game and XR studios of varying sizes and hosts monthly meetings 
of the International Game Developers Association. Ann Arbor is also 
home to many nationally and internationally recognized businesses like 
Domino&#x27;s Pizza, one of the largest pizza brands in the world.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
City of Ann Arbor on the occasion of their bicentennial. For the past 
200 years, Ann Arbor has stood as a beacon of progress, diversity, and 
excellence. From its humble beginnings to its current status as a 
thriving and exemplary city, this milestone is a testament to their 
commitment to innovation, education, and community. We are excited to 
see what the residents of Ann Arbor can accomplish in the years to 
come.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Mrs. 
Betty Jo Cook Williams of Texarkana, Texas, who peacefully passed away 
on May 12, 2024 with her family by her side.
  Mrs. Williams was born on December 20, 1943, at Eglin Air Force Base, 
Florida. She spent most of her childhood on a small family farm in 
Henderson County, Texas, where she developed a passion for 
horticulture, conservation, and self-reliance. Mrs. Williams graduated 
with honors from East Texas State University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree 
in art and a master&#x27;s degree in education. It was during this time that 
she met her husband of 58 years, Doug. Afterwards, Mrs. Williams began 
her career as a schoolteacher at Texarkana Independent School District, 
where she taught for 33 years. She participated in professional 
development workshops and trained with the Hatton W. Sumner Institute 
to improve her understanding of individual freedom and civic 
responsibility. Throughout the years, Mrs. Williams was recognized as a 
distinguished educator who strived to make a difference in students&#x27; 
lives.
  After retiring from TISD, Mrs. Williams stayed in touch with Highland 
Park Elementary School and volunteered to help train new teachers. She 
was a board member of the Bowie and Miller County Literacy Council and 
a treasurer for the Texas Classroom Teachers&#x27; Association. For her 
outstanding work, the TCTA selected Mrs. Williams as the ``Retired 
Teacher of the Year&#x27;&#x27; in 2003. She also served as an election judge for 
Bowie County for over twenty years and attended numerous GOP 
conventions statewide as a delegate. I am saddened to hear of Mrs. 
Williams&#x27; passing. Her legacy of dedication, public service, and family 
values will be remembered for many years to come.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol to honor Mrs. Williams&#x27; wonderful life. She will be dearly 
missed by her friends, family, and all who knew her.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional 
achievements of Edwin Torres DeSantiago, who will soon begin his 
doctoral program in Public Affairs as the University of Minnesota 
Humphrey School&#x27;s first DACA recipient.
  Edwin arrived in the United States from El Salvador at eight years 
old. Despite early academic success, Edwin did not believe that he 
could get a college education in the United States due to his status as 
an undocumented immigrant. However, when the Obama Administration 
established the DACA program, he then had the opportunity to attend 
Saint John&#x27;s University in Saint Joseph, Minnesota, where he excelled 
in academics and earned many University-wide awards. During his college 
education and beyond, he has been a tireless advocate for first 
generation and Latine students, leading to an appointment to his alma 
mater&#x27;s Board of Trustees in 2023. His advocacy for our community 
members is not limited to students, throughout his life Edwin has 
championed countless progressive leaders and policies that have 
improved the lives of so many Minnesotans. Admirably, Edwin recently 
earned his master&#x27;s degree in public affairs from the Humphrey School 
while continuing his career and extensive community service.
  Edwin will now embark on the years-long journey of earning a doctoral 
degree in Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota Humphrey 
School, where his exceptional achievements and demonstrated investment 
in the community earned him a full-ride scholarship. Beyond his 
admission to the program and tremendous scholarship, Edwin&#x27;s status as 
the Humphrey School&#x27;s first DACA recipient to attend the program makes 
this achievement duly commendable.
  Edwin&#x27;s acceptance to the Humphrey School is a testament to his 
decades of hard work and leadership. I am so proud to call him a 
Minnesotan and recognize that Dreamers like Edwin make our state, and 
our country, a better place. I have no doubt that Edwin will be 
successful as a doctoral student and look forward to the continued 
positive change he will bring to our community.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Edwin 
for his incredible accomplishment and wishing him luck as he starts 
this new chapter.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, today, I am proud to recognize and 
congratulate Mr. Walt Koenig, who is retiring from his position as 
President and CEO of the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce. I greatly 
appreciate Mr. Koenig&#x27;s four years of dedicated service which 
profoundly impacted the San Angelo community.
  I was born and raised in San Angelo and am proud to call San Angelo 
my home. In recent years, I have witnessed significant growth and 
positive change across the city. Thanks to our leadership in both 
enterprise and government, San Angelo has become one of the best small 
cities for business. Mr. Koenig&#x27;s stewardship and enthusiasm for 
improving our city across the board have left a lasting impact that is 
greatly valued by the entire San Angelo community.
  Before his tenure at the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Koenig 
served as the President and CEO of the Kerrville Chamber of Commerce 
and the Executive Director of the Kerr County Economic Development 
Program. Mr. Koenig&#x27;s many contributions on the business level include 
over 25 years of experience in the telecommunications industry. Along 
with his history in business, Mr. Koenig also served 8 years as a 
senior diplomat with the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce.
  Mr. Koenig made no waste of his four years serving the community of 
San Angelo. Under his leadership, San Angelo was established as the 
Visual Arts Capitol of Texas, the 2024 Best Visitor Center in Texas, 
and the 2024 People&#x27;s Choice Award for Best Destination for Arts and 
Culture in the State of Texas. Along with these accolades, San Angelo 
has seen significant economic growth due to a surge in new local 
businesses, tourism, and overall quality of life. Due to his hard work 
and enthusiastic support for the city, it is safe to say that Mr. 
Koenig left the greater San Angelo community in a better position than 
he found it.
  Beyond his duties at the Chamber of Commerce, Walt was also a civic 
leader for Goodfellow Air Force Base. Mr. Koenig was heavily involved 
at the base, including going out of his way to speak with students from 
other countries in their native language. Throughout his tenure, Mr. 
Koenig consistently went above and beyond in his unwavering support for 
the community, which left an indelible mark on the city of San Angelo. 
He and his wife, MG, poured their hearts out for our community, and for 
that, I will always be thankful.
  Walt is a good friend of our office and our community--he will be 
missed dearly. I am proud to honor Mr. Walt Koenig&#x27;s incredible 
contributions to the city of San Angelo during his successful tenure. I 
extend my most heartfelt wishes to his family for a smooth transition 
as they embark on their journey to Italy.

                         HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the remarkable efforts of 
community leaders and organizations in battling the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including AYUDA, Inc., Familias Triunfadoras, Dona Ana County--Health &amp; 
Human Services, and Family Support Services of Amarillo, along with 
dedicated leaders like Nora Hernandez, Josiah Heyman, Mark Jurado, 
Adriana Orozco, Gina Nunez-Mchiri, and the memory of Patricia Juarez 
Carrillo.
  The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to our 
communities, particularly impacting vulnerable populations such as 
farmworkers, dairy workers, and meatpacking workers. Recognizing the 
urgent need for targeted interventions, our dedicated leaders partnered 
with the National COVID-19 Resiliency Network (NCRN) to address the 
specific needs of these communities.
  Our leader&#x27;s collaboration with community-based organizations aimed 
to provide essential resources and support to migrant workers and food 
production workers in El Paso, Moore, TX, and Dona Ana, NM counties. 
The project began with disseminating vital COVID-19 information and 
evolved to address emerging needs, including vaccine access, mental 
health support, and promoting the NCRN application.
  By early February 2024, substantial progress had been achieved in 
providing essential COVID-19 resources to farmworkers, dairy workers, 
and meatpacking workers. Crucial, targeted outreach efforts meant 
thousands of these workers received the COVID-19 vaccine, tests, 
resources, and more. These initiatives highlight a comprehensive 
approach to supporting essential workers&#x27; health and well-being and our 
greater community. The collaborative efforts of these organizations and 
leaders have been crucial in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and 
promoting health equity in our communities, reflecting the spirit of 
compassion and solidarity.
  Today, I am honored to pay tribute to all those involved in this 
noble endeavor. Their selfless contributions have made a profound 
difference in the lives of countless individuals and families, and 
their legacy of service will be remembered for generations to come.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JIMMY GOMEZ

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional 
contributions of Esther Kim, our Asian Pacific American Institute for 
Congressional Studies (APAICS) fellow, who has used her talents for the 
betterment of California and the U.S. Congress as a whole. From 
astutely demanding answers from the Food and Drug Administration on how 
lead-tainted food was able to get to the plates of children and what 
the agency would do to ensure it never happened again, to building key 
coalitions of support and helping pass through the House a bill to 
redesignate a Koreatown post office in honor of activist Dosan Ahn 
Chang Ho, Esther&#x27;s insights and diligence have made real change and 
pushed important congressional efforts forward.
  As she prepares to enter Yale Divinity School in the fall, I am 
certain her time in Congress is only the beginning of the impact Esther 
Kim will make on our nation. I know I speak for everyone who 
encountered Esther on the Hill when I say we can&#x27;t wait to see what she 
will do change the world next.

 RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF VIRGINIA BASLER AND HER SERVICE TO THE UNITED 
                           STATES OF AMERICA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of 
Virginia Basler, a resident of Ypsilanti, Michigan and veteran of WWII, 
and to mourn her passing. Her dedication to her country and local 
community over a long and exceptional life is worthy of commendation.
  Virginia was born in Alpena, Michigan, on a family farm as the middle 
of three children. During WWII, while her older brother enlisted in the 
Air Force, Virginia and a friend moved down to Ypsilanti to work at the 
Willow Run Bomber Plant. For almost two years, she worked on the 
production line, drilling rivet holes for B-24 Liberator bombers.
  As soon as she met the age requirement, Virginia enlisted in the 
Coast Guard Women&#x27;s Reserves (SPARS) to serve her country in another 
way. She attended Boot Camp at Sheepshead Bay, New York, where she was 
trained as a baker, and she was assigned to the Coast Guard Station in 
Washington, D.C. where she would remain for the duration of the war. 
After her service was finished, Virginia came back to Ypsilanti where 
she again worked at the Willow Run Plant, now a Kaiser-Frazer car 
factory.
  In the decades after, Virginia lived a full life. She married 
Leonard, a WWII veteran himself, and raised a family of three children. 
She continued her life of service, cooking for the Ypsilanti Public 
Schools and Eastern Michigan University. Following her retirement in 
1990, Virginia was active in the community, volunteering for Meals on 
Wheels and the local charity Thrift Shop. She was also very active with 
the American Rosie the Riveter Association, attending events with other 
Rosies and WWII vets. We were overjoyed to host Virginia and other 
Rosies in the Capitol during the Honor Flight event in 2023.
  Getting to know Virginia over the years meant a lot to me. As a 
Rosie, she and her colleagues were not only vital members of our 
Nation&#x27;s efforts during the Second World War, but they opened doors and 
have been inspirations for the generations of women that followed. Her 
wisdom and strength inspired many, including myself, to reach for 
achievements that in past generations would have been unthinkable.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today celebrating the 
life of Virginia Basler. Virginia was an incredible representation of 
answering our Nation&#x27;s highest calling. She served her country with 
honor in WWII and afterward throughout her local community, bringing 
joy, enthusiasm, and love to everyone she met along the way. We mourn 
with her loved ones and thank them for sharing Virginia with us.

               RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF CHIEF RANDY COX

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Somerset 
Borough Police Chief Randy Cox on his 47 years of service to our 
community.
  Randy felt called to serve from a young age and always wanted to be a 
police officer. He began his law enforcement career as a police officer 
in 1977 for Seven Springs Borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. He 
transitioned to the Ligonier Borough Police Department in 1981 and rose 
to the rank of police chief in 1990. On August 9, 2004, Randy became 
the chief of the Somerset Borough Police Department, where he served 
for the past 19 years.
  Randy kept a local and positive approach to his law enforcement 
duties. Through his teaching role at the Westmoreland County Community 
College Police Academy and Penn State-Fayette, Randy prepared officers 
for all the hardships associated with law enforcement. Additionally, he 
graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy&#x27;s 
204th Session in 2001. Randy took this education and incorporated what 
he learned into training sessions at local academies. He also served as 
an assessor for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Law Enforcement 
Accreditation Committee to ensure that all police officers were 
qualified for the job&#x27;s rigorous duties. He demonstrated a long-lasting 
commitment to southwestern Pennsylvania law enforcement officials, and 
his legacy will be remembered for generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, Randy Cox served southwestern Pennsylvania dutifully for 
the past 47 years. On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 14th 
Congressional District, I congratulate him on a long, successful career 
serving southwestern Pennsylvania communities.

                   TRIBUTE TO MRS. JANIE B. RANDOLPH

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 23, 2024

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable 
mother, humanitarian, and beloved community figure as she celebrates a 
milestone in her extraordinary life. Mrs. Janie B. Randolph will 
celebrate her 100th birthday on June 4, and I join family and friends 
in celebrating this significant occasion.
  Mrs. Randolph was born on June 4, 1924, in Congaree, South Carolina. 
She attended Richland County Public Schools and achieved her lifelong 
goal of obtaining her high school diploma in 1970 from the Richland 
County Adult Education Center. She furthered her education by attending 
Midlands Technical College, where she took classes in fashion design. 
Her interest in fashion led her to become a highly skilled seamstress 
and develop a passion for knitting and crocheting.
  Mrs. Randolph is the proud mother of six children--Barbara, Romeo, 
Joyce, Nancy, Jacqulyn, and Kenneth--plus two additional children by 
love, Tom Adams and Sheriff Leon Lott. All of her children attended 
college and served in the military. She is also a grandmother, great-
grandmother, great-great-grandmother, and a surrogate mother to many. 
Her four beloved cats, Lilibeth, Corabell, Marthann, and Cleolynn, are 
her constant companions.
  As a founding member of the Good Shepherd Holiness Church, Mrs. 
Randolph holds the esteemed title of Mother of the Church. For years, 
she was an active participant in various church activities, including 
the Musical Choir, Youth Department, Missionary Society, Vacation Bible 
School, and Women&#x27;s Ministry. Her dedication to her faith community is 
a testament to her unwavering spirit and love for service.
  Beyond her contributions to the church, Mrs. Randolph is the former 
owner of Brooks Grocery Store, a cornerstone of her community. A Gold 
Star Wife and a member of the Tuesday Rockers and United Order of 
Tents, Mrs. Randolph has always been active in community service and is 
a former member of the Hopkins Adult Senior Citizens Program, where she 
volunteered with Meals on Wheels. She also loves socializing, 
entertaining, gardening, and reading scripture.
  Mrs. Randolph&#x27;s motto, ``Helping Others to Help Others,&#x27;&#x27; reflects 
her life&#x27;s work. Her favorite hymns, ``Rock of Ages&#x27;&#x27; and ``Nearer My 
God To Thee,&#x27;&#x27; and her cherished scripture, ``The Lord is my Shepherd; 
I shall not want&#x27;&#x27; (Psalms 23), are a testament to her deep faith and 
guiding principles. Her favorite saying, ``If you know better, you will 
do better,&#x27;&#x27; encapsulates her belief in the power of knowledge and 
self-improvement.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in celebrating 
the tremendous life of Mrs. Janie B. Randolph on the occasion of her 
100th birthday. I thank her for her tireless efforts to better our 
community and her unwavering dedication to helping others. May her 
legacy continue to uplift and inspire us all.
