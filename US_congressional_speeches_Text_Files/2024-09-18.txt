                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Joni Carrico of 
Graves County on being chosen as the 2024 Angel to Adoption by the 
Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. Ms. Carrico has worked 
tirelessly with Hope That Binds, a nonprofit organization based out of 
Western Kentucky that aims to provide financial assistance for foster 
and adoptive families. Through Hope That Binds, a network of loving 
families is growing and expanding. To date, over 100 families have been 
assisted through the organization&#x27;s fundraisers and grant program.
  Throughout her time at Hope That Binds, Ms. Carrico has been a voice 
of advocacy in her church and community. Her service has provided much 
encouragement to the 1st Congressional District of Kentucky and our 
constituents. She remains an important voice for hopeful parents 
seeking to grow their home.
  Ms. Carrico is an outstanding leader in Western Kentucky and her work 
impacts our communities daily. I thank Ms. Carrico for supporting, 
connecting and advocating for Kentucky families.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize 
former staff member Beatrice Holding for her service to the citizens of 
the District of South Carolina.
  Beatrice was a valued team member, and both her contributions and 
presence will be missed. Upon graduating from the University of North 
Carolina, she took on staff assistant duties in the Washington Office 
and immediately became a welcomed, energetic face.
  As the daughter of former Congressman George Holding from North 
Carolina, Beatrice was already familiar with the work of Congress and 
was able to jump directly into policy work, eventually earning her the 
title of Legislative Aide.
  Beatrice brought a unique background to the office being a dual U.S.-
U.K. citizen, always helping the staff and myself to use proper 
English. I offer her the best of luck as she continues her career in 
politics working on the campaign of North Carolina U.S. Congressional 
Candidate Brad Knott.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected 
America for 20 years as the Global War On Terrorism moves from the 
Afghanistan safe haven to America. We do not need new border laws. We 
need to enforce the existing border laws. Harris shamefully opens 
borders for dictators as more 9/11 attacks across America are imminent, 
as repeatedly warned by the FBI.

                    HONORING SENATOR WENDELL H. FORD

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MORGAN McGARVEY

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the 
great leaders in the history of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, former 
Governor and United States Senator Wendell H. Ford. September 8, 2024, 
would have been Senator Ford&#x27;s 100th birthday, and the day brought back 
many special memories for me, my family, and countless others whose 
lives were improved by his lifetime of service.
  Born September 8, 1924, he is the first and only Kentuckian to ever 
serve as a state senator, lieutenant governor, governor, and United 
States senator. His career started in 1965 as a state senator from his 
hometown of Owensboro, later saw him serve as the Commonwealth&#x27;s 49th 
governor from 1971 to 1974, and concluded with his retirement in 
January 1999 after four consecutive terms in the United States Senate.
  First elected to the Senate in December 1974, he served as Democratic 
whip from 1991 until his retirement. In the Senate, he played a key 
role in shaping many key pieces of legislation, including the National 
Voter Registration Act, the Federal Aviation Administration 
Authorization Act of 1994, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the 
National Energy Security Act of 1992, the Aviation Safety and Capacity 
Act of 1990, the Airport and Airways Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, 
the Age Discrimination Act in Employment Act Amendments of 1986, the 
Tobacco Reform Act of 1985, and the Energy Security Act of 1977. As 
chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, he led 
the Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies for the inaugurations of 
President George H.W. Bush in 1989 and President William Jefferson 
Clinton in 1993 and 1997.
  In reflecting on Senator Ford&#x27;s long and accomplished career--and 
what it might mean for us today--three thoughts stand out:
  First, he believed with all his heart that the sole purpose of 
government was to serve people, and he lived that philosophy every day 
in every office he held.
  Second, he thought that politics was an honorable calling and that 
government at any level could not succeed unless individuals from all 
walks of life took time to become involved and engaged.
  Third, coming from the state that produced Henry Clay, he recognized 
democracy could not work without compromise involving give and take 
from all sides. He was fond of saying that there are no victories in 
Washington, only varying degrees of defeat.
  Senator Ford continued his life of service after his Senate career 
ended, teaching at the University of Kentucky, working with young 
people at the Wendell H. Ford Education Center in Owensboro, and 
serving as a mentor to countless young leaders across the Commonwealth. 
He passed away on January 22, 2015, at the age of 90. His wife Jean 
celebrated her 100th birthday on March 1 of this year and still lives 
in the family home in Owensboro. She and Senator Ford were married 71 
years before his passing.
  On a personal note, I would add that one of those young people 
receiving Senator Ford&#x27;s wise counsel was me. He was a tremendous role 
model for me, a close friend of my family, and someone who demonstrated 
the true meaning of public service. Let his lifetime commitment of 
service be an example for us all as we remember him on the occasion of 
his 100th birthday.

     HONORING THE SERVICE OF NICK F. KASTRANTAS DURING WORLD WAR II

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. HALEY M. STEVENS

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to recognize the 
honorable life of Sergeant Nicholas F. Kastrantas, a distinguished 
veteran, father, and artist. Mr. Kastrantas, in his military service, 
creative endeavors, and personal life displayed intelligence, 
dedication, and a commitment to fighting on behalf of the greater good.
  Mr. Kastrantas was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in Greece, where 
he joined the Greek army and mastered the art of cartography. He 
returned to the U.S. in 1939 and immediately enlisted to serve his 
country. He was personally selected by Lieutenant Colonel James Gavin 
to contribute his artistic and linguistic abilities to the 505th 
Parachute Infantry. Mr. Kastrantas was a skilled mapmaker and spoke 
five languages fluently, allowing him to be an incredible asset to the 
82nd Airborne Division during World War II.
  Affectionately nicknamed ``The Greek,&#x27;&#x27; he used his skills to map 
drop points at Normandy and completed four combat jumps in Normandy, 
Sicily, Salerno, and Holland as a paratrooper. His intelligence and 
abilities were invaluable, enabling him to create a 3-dimensional sand 
table map for his unit&#x27;s mission on D-Day. Nick also fought in the 
Battle of the Bulge and earned six bronze stars, the Combat Infantryman 
Badge, and the Parachutist Badge through his heroic service.
  Mr. Kastrantas settled down in Detroit, MI after the war and made a 
name for himself as a commercial artist. He lived a long life and left 
us on August 31, 2011. His legacy lives on through his daughter, Ann, 
and in his murals that can be found in restaurants around Michigan.
  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply honored to recognize the life and service of 
Private Nicholas F. Kastrantas--a man who used his creativity and 
dedication to serve his country in its hour of need. Please join me in 
celebrating his wondrous life.

  Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember a dear 
friend, Dr. Shelia Ross who passed away on September 13 after a hard-
fought battle of cancer. As the Director of The University of South 
Alabama Health Stroke Program, Dr. Ross was focused on working with 
other health officials and community members on advocating for brain 
health and stroke care. She used every opportunity to educate the 
residents of Mobile about the functions of the brain, in specific 
relation to strokes. I am honored to have had such a courageous 
individual and friend residing in and helping the people of the First 
District of Alabama, and we will miss her greatly.

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gary Thompson of

exceptional service to the people of our Nation and the people of North 
Texas.

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
loving husband, dedicated father, seasoned legislative affairs 
executive, and dear friend of longstanding, Mr. Scott Orr for his 
nearly 42 years working at Georgia Power. Scott will be retiring after 
42 years of working with the company and a reception will be held in 
his honor on September 18, 2024, at the Southern Company DC Office.
  Scott Orr began working with Georgia Power in 1982 as an Industrial 
Marketing Engineer. His work touched the areas of marketing, 
engineering, district sales, region sales, district operations, and 
customer service. For the past 22 years, Scott has worked as Manager of 
Federal Legislative Affairs. Throughout his work at Georgia Power, 
Scott has worked with over 40 members of the Georgia Congressional 
Delegation and their staffs over multiple Congresses, advising them on 
a myriad of issues relative to clean, safe, reliable, and affordable 
energy.
  Scott has made a tremendous impact in the lives of millions of 
Georgians. His work on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, led to the 
expansion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4--America&#x27;s first new nuclear 
unit in 30 years. He has truly been a friend and fierce advocate for 
Georgia Power&#x27;s 2.7 million customers. Moreover, during storms and 
natural disasters, Scott has been a valued source of real time 
information for congressional offices and our constituents. He also has 
been a valued resource in dealing with and navigating countless 
constituent service issues in mine and other Congressional offices.
  It has been said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space 
that we occupy here on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; Scott has paid his rent, and he 
has paid it well. His service to numerous social and civic 
organizations includes serving as Vice Chair of the Georgia Youth 
Challenge Academy Foundation&#x27;s Board of Directors, the Athens Chamber 
of Commerce and the Classic City Kiwanis Club. Moreover, Scott has 
served on the boards of Southern Polytechnic State University 
Foundation; New Hope Enterprises; United Way of Northeast Georgia; the 
Athens YWCO, Athens Regional Medical Center Foundation, and the 
Foundation for Excellence in Public Education.
  Scott has accomplished so much throughout his life and career, but 
none of it would have been possible without the Grace of God and the 
love and support of his wife, Benita; their three daughters, Whitney, 
Jessica, and Ansley and their families, including his five 
grandchildren.
  Sir Winston Churchill often said: ``You make your living by what you 
get; you make your life by what you give.&#x27;&#x27; Throughout his career, Mr. 
Scott Orr has made a concerted effort to serve as a mentor and give a 
helping hand to new employees at Georgia Power. His legacy of uplifting 
others will be felt by all those whose lives he touched in the state of 
Georgia, in Washington, DC, and across this great Nation.
  On a personal note, I am blessed to call Scott my friend. It has been 
a pleasure working with Scott during my time in elective office. He has 
become a close and trusted friend. Scott never told me only what I 
wanted to hear; he always told me what he felt I needed to hear. I will 
always cherish the fidelity of his friendship and the timbre of his 
character.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian; and me, 
along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia&#x27;s Second 
Congressional District, in recognizing Mr. Scott Orr&#x27;s over four 
decades of service to Georgia Power, the citizens of Georgia, and our 
great Nation. May God continue to bless him and his family as he moves 
to the next chapter of his remarkable life.

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bilby Family of 
Franklin County who has received the 2024 Angels in Adoption Award from 
the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.
  Each year, CCAI selects individuals across the country who are 
committed to improving the lives of children in need of loving homes.
  The Bilby Family started their journey in 2017 and immediately 
recognized the need for foster parents in Kentucky. In 2019, 2-year-old 
James came into the family&#x27;s life. Since adopting James, the Bilby 
Family has grown closer, and James has become an integral part of their 
family. Their story can serve as a blueprint for others who seek to 
open their homes and hearts to children in need of a forever family.
  The entire 1st Congressional District of Kentucky should be proud of 
the Bilby Family.

[[Page E922]]

Their advocacy is inspiring and will have a lasting impact in Franklin 
County and beyond. I thank the Bilby family for supporting and 
advocating for Kentucky families.

                          ____________________

                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the work of the 
Presidential Service Badge

[[Page E921]]

Foundation, a new organization seeking to raise awareness about the 
importance of public service by empowering servicemembers and their 
families.
  Through philanthropic efforts, including a newly launched scholarship 
fund, the Foundation seeks to raise awareness of the connection between 
family and our military. Additionally, the Foundation seeks to showcase 
the honored men and women who earn the Presidential Service Badge 
through non-partisan support to the Office of the President.
  As the Dean of the Massachusetts and New England Delegations, I would 
like to join Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey in recognizing this 
organization and commending them for their support of those who have 
served our democracy. I am proud of the fact that New England is home 
to more Presidential Service Badge recipients than any other region in 
the country, with over 2,000 in Massachusetts alone. I thank them for 
their hard work, and I wish them many more years of success and 
prosperity.

                                 ______

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                     Wednesday, September 18, 2024

  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vance Lelli, 
who retired earlier this month from his positions as a committed 
longshoreman and as head of the Pierce County Central Labor Council. He 
also served over two decades on the Washington State Labor Council 
Central Committee.
  The Lelli family are known for their instrumental role in attracting 
new businesses and economic opportunities to the Port of Tacoma and 
transitioning it into one of the principal ports of entry on the 
Pacific Coast. Vance Lelli has built upon this legacy in his own way, 
profoundly impacting our local longshoremen and women and the broader 
labor community in Washington State.
  Throughout his career, Vance has been a tireless advocate for working 
people, championing their rights and welfare with dedication. His 
efforts have strengthened working conditions and are supporting working 
families and retirees across the state. On behalf of the thousands of 
union households in the South Sound, I thank Vance for his decades of 
service and leadership. His contributions have made a lasting 
difference. I wish him all the best as he begins this new chapter of 
his life.
  Congratulations to Vance.
