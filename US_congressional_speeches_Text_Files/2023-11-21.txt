          CELEBRATING DR. DIETER MARTIN GRUEN&#x27;S 101ST BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. SEAN CASTEN

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 21, 2023

  Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 101st birthday 
of Dr. Dieter Martin Gruen for his dedication to science, significant 
contributions to new energy technologies, and devotion to fighting 
climate change. For over eight decades, Dr. Gruen has worked to enhance 
American technology development as a former Manhattan Project Scientist 
and as an Argonne National Laboratory Distinguished Fellow.
  Dr. Gruen&#x27;s story signifies the American dream. Born in Waldorf, 
Germany in 1922 to a Jewish family, Dr. Gruen would eventually leave 
his home only fourteen years later when the Nazi party solidified its 
power. He was sent to Little Rock, Arkansas to live with relatives to 
finish up his high school education while his parents were sent to 
concentration camps. Luckily, his mother and father escaped and Dr. 
Gruen was reunited with them in Chicago a few years later.
  The shock of nearly losing his family did not dissuade Dr. Gruen from 
dedicating himself to his studies and empirical inquiry. Five years 
after reuniting with his family, Dr. Gruen received his bachelor&#x27;s 
degree in chemistry from Northwestern University in 1944, his master&#x27;s 
degree, and eventually a PhD in chemical physics from the University of 
Chicago. He studied at night and worked at a machine shop during the 
day. Shortly after graduating from Northwestern University, Dr. Gruen 
was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, the U.S. government&#x27;s 
top-secret effort to develop the atomic bomb. He worked on the large-
scale electromagnetic separation of uranium-235, and the nuclear 
material he helped to produce would later be fashioned into the bomb 
that fell on Hiroshima in 1945.
  After the war, Dr. Gruen helped found the Oak Ridge Scientists and 
Engineers, a group dedicated to ensuring nuclear weapons were never 
used again in war. After returning home to Chicago, he began working at 
Argonne National Laboratory, one year after the establishment of the 
U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories and during a time when 
Argonne was a national center for the development of nuclear reactors. 
Dr. Gruens work at Argonne focused on nuclear power and led to him 
serving as a delegate to the Second United Nations Conference on 
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1958.
  Throughout his career, Dr. Gruen has made significant contributions 
to new energy technologies, specifically to nuclear fission and fusion, 
solar energy, energy storage, and conservation. Dr. Gruen has been 
recognized by the international scientific community and has made key 
advancements such as the nuclear submarine reactor cooling design and 
purification of uranium used to end World War II in the Pacific 
theater.
  For these accomplishments and his lifelong commitment to science, I 
had the great honor of supporting Dr. Gruen&#x27;s nomination for the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom alongside my colleagues, Representatives 
Bill Foster, French Hill, Jerry McNerney, and Cheri Bustos. Dr. Gruen&#x27;s 
tireless and selfless efforts to solve future clean energy challenges 
presented by climate change is seldom exhibited by an individual. 
Humble and unpretentious, Dr. Gruen is the embodiment of a dedicated 
American and pure scientist.
  I have had the great pleasure of learning from Dr. Gruen from his 
life stories and scientific endeavors in innovation and inquiry. Today, 
I wish Dr. Gruen a very happy 101st birthday and thank him for his 
decades of public service and remarkable advancements in and commitment 
to scientific research and discovery.

                                 ______

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 21, 2023

  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is with great enthusiasm that 
I recognize my longtime friend, sister, and someone with whom we&#x27;ve 
served interchangeably as mentors to one another, Senator Nan Rich, as 
she assumes the office of Mayor of Broward County, Florida.
  Senator Rich was first elected as Broward County Commissioner in 2016 
and re-elected, unopposed, in 2020. She was recently selected by her 
colleagues on the County Commission to be the Vice Mayor of Broward 
County through November 2023 and now selected to serve as Mayor. Her 
top priority has been addressing the affordable housing crisis in 
Broward, as well as ending homelessness.
  Prior to her service on the County Commission, Senator Rich was 
elected to the Florida State Senate in 2004 after serving two terms in 
the Florida House of Representatives. She was recognized as one of the 
most passionate and dedicated members of the Florida Legislature and 
was the first woman to be elected Senate Democratic Leader.
  Her years of advocacy and activism on behalf of women, children, and 
families is admirable and inspiring. She served as the National 
President of the National Council of Jewish Women, the first Floridian 
elected to that office. She was also honored to receive an appointment 
by President Bill Clinton to serve as a Member of the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum Council in Washington, D.C.
  My friendship with Senator Rich runs deep. When I first ran for 
office at the age of 25, she was one of the first people I called for 
advice. She subsequently succeeded me in the Florida House and the 
Florida Senate. She is someone who paved the way for women to reach and 
shatter the glass ceiling--helping to break the barriers of gender-bias 
and discrimination. I am proud to have stood on the shoulders of my 
friend--Florida&#x27;s friend--Nan Rich.
  On behalf of the people of Florida&#x27;s 25th district, we are grateful 
for Senator Rich&#x27;s leadership and look forward to the progress she will 
continue to make as Broward County&#x27;s next Mayor.

  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I 
rise to recognize the remarkable life of Carolyn W. Jones.
  As a woman of faith, Carolyn was a leader of St. Ruth Missionary 
Baptist Church in Dania Beach where she served as a Trustee, Church 
Clerk, and as a member of the Hospitality Ministry.
  Carolyn, along with other prominent church members, was instrumental 
in ensuring St.

[[Page E1122]]

Ruth was recognized with a commemorative historical marker, detailing 
the notable status of the church in the community. Carolyn was also one 
of the founders of the revered JWS-Journey of Hope Cancer Ministry at 
St. Ruth. As a strong compassionate, servant leader, Carolyn had a 
passion for supporting and working in the community to fight against 
cancer. Carolyn was the team leader for the Dania Beach Relay for Life 
fundraising walks, where she and others in the community walked to 
honor cancer survivors.
  Carolyn&#x27;s love for developing young minds led her to be a part of the 
Broward County Public School District for more than 38 years. Her 
esteemed career included Parkway Middle School, Apollo Middle School, 
and Attucks Middle School. The pinnacle of Carolyn&#x27;s educational career 
was when she was honored as Attucks Middle School Teacher of the Year. 
She was also a member of The Charmettes, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, 
and the Red Hat Society.
  As a supportive wife, Carolyn stood by her husband Albert as he 
served on both the Dania Beach and Broward County Commissions.
  Truly an inspiration, Carolyn is remembered for her kind and generous 
spirit and legacy of service to family, church, and community. My heart 
is with her family in mourning the loss of this kind, generous, and 
compassionate soul. We were forever privileged to have shared this time 
with her.
  May her memory be for a blessing.

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 21, 2023

  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Gary Petersen, a 
dedicated leader hailing from the Tri-Cities, who tragically lost his 
fight to cancer this past month. It saddens me that rather than 
announcing his next great achievement, I am instead here to mourn his 
passing.
  Gary was known throughout both Central Washington, the U.S. Capitol, 
and the Department of Energy as a fierce advocate for the interests of 
the Tri-Cities. His leadership in our communities proved fruitful for 
decades, sparking both economic development and innovation for the 
citizens of Central Washington.
  His advocacy for the Hanford cleanup mission has been the cornerstone 
of the success of our region, and I am in awe of the impact he has made 
over the years. His immense knowledge, wisdom, and understanding of our 
community&#x27;s priorities was matched by so few, and I have no doubt his 
name will go down in history with the likes of Sam Volpentest and Bob 
Ferguson.
  Gary&#x27;s legacy includes leading advocacy for the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory&#x27;s campus, supporting the advancement of the Hanford 
cleanup mission, and advocating for growing the local economy at 
TRIDEC; he will also be known as a loving husband, father, grandfather, 
and personal friend of mine.
  While he will be missed, his legacy will continue to live on in every 
corner of the Tri-Cities and Central Washington.

                       Tuesday, November 21, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, Today I want to recognize my friend, William 
``Bill&#x27;&#x27; Goodman. Bill was an iconic member of our Detroit legal 
community who never wavered in fighting for the working class, the most 
vulnerable among us. I met Bill over fifteen years ago when he was 
President of the Maurice and Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic and 
Social Justice. He was a mentor to many of us young attorneys and a 
hero to many who were seeking justice.
  Born in 1940, Bill grew up in northwest Detroit, where he witnessed 
the injustices of racism and segregation. This, combined with the 
values instilled in him by his parents, informed the path Bill would 
take with his career and life&#x27;s work. He earned his juris doctorate 
from the University of Chicago in 1964, returned to Detroit during the 
height of the civil rights movement, and went to work in partnership 
with his father, Ernie Goodman. Over the course of his career, Bill 
took on numerous high-profile cases. He worked as legal director for 
the Center for Constitutional Rights, where he represented Guantanamo 
Bay detainees, Vietnamese survivors of Agent Orange, and the wrongfully 
detained. He sought to focus his work on the protection of civil 
liberties. Bill eventually returned to Detroit as partner at the law 
firm Goodman Hurwitz, where he continued to represent families and 
individuals who were victims of police and government misconduct.
  Bill worked with a number of legal advocacy organizations, including 
the National Lawyers Guild, ACLU, and Sugar Law Center, where I got to 
know him when we both served as board members. I knew Bill to be a 
fierce advocate, a brilliant legal mind, and a tenacious but kind 
warrior for justice.
  Please join me in tribute to Bill Goodman, remembering his life and 
distinguished career. May he rest in power.

       INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING EQUITY 
                           ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 21, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Government 
Advertising Equity Accountability Act, which would require all federal 
agencies to include in their annual budget requests to Congress the 
amount they spend on advertising contracts with small disadvantaged 
businesses (SDBs) and businesses owned by minorities and women. Federal 
agencies would be required to provide prior and projected total 
expenditures for such contracts. At my request, the Committee on 
Appropriations has been requiring such information from many agencies 
for the last several years, but this bill would codify this requirement 
and apply it to all federal agencies.
  In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined spending 
on advertising contracts with minority-owned businesses by five 
agencies--the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, 
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the 
Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--and 
found that only five percent of the $4.3 billion available for 
advertising contracts went to minority businesses. In light of these 
concerning findings, several Members of Congress and I sent letters to 
GAO in April 2016 and June 2022 requesting updated information on the 
amount of federal advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses 
owned by minorities and women. A GAO report released in July 2018 
showed that in fiscal year 2017, only 16 percent of the federal 
government&#x27;s advertising contract obligations went to SDBs and 
businesses owned by minorities and women. GAO agreed last year to issue 
an updated report.
  The federal government is the largest advertiser in the United 
States, and it has an obligation to ensure equitable access to its 
contracts for SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women. The 
GAO&#x27;s findings demonstrate that there is still much progress to be 
made.
  The regular collection of information on federal advertising 
contracts with SDBs and businesses owned by women and minorities is 
essential to bridging the gap between what current statistics show and 
a more inclusive advertising landscape. This bill would help achieve 
this goal while also promoting transparency and encouraging federal 
agencies to strive to reach minorities, who often receive the news from 
smaller media outlets that serve communities of color. The requirement 
that agencies submit prior and projected information on the amount of 
advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities 
and women would allow federal agencies to evaluate their progress. The 
regular collection of this information would also demonstrate that the 
promotion of equity in advertising, and in all areas of government, is 
a continuous effort and is important to the mission of every agency.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

          NO STOLEN TRADEMARKS HONORED IN AMERICA ACT OF 2023

                                 ______

                           HON. DARRELL ISSA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, November 13, 2023

  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, recognizing and safeguarding intellectual 
property rights is a vital interest for the United States and a 
critical component of our leadership, which has historically championed 
strong IP rights.
  Consistent and strong IP rights ensure that business will seek to 
innovate in the U.S. and enjoy the protections granted under our 
Constitution and laws.
  It goes without saying that strong IP protections require that the 
government respect IP ownership and the right of IP owners to control 
who exercises their rights.
  Similarly obvious is that the government should not condone IP theft.
  That is exactly what has happened with the trademarks stolen by the 
Communist government of Cuba.
  As if oppressing and brutalizing the Cuban people was not enough, the 
Castro regime also stole IP from legitimate owners during its vicious 
takeover of Cuba.
  This included stealing valuable trademarks, such as ``Havana Club,&#x27;&#x27; 
from the Arechabala family.
  The Arechabala family for years invested their time and resources 
building a world-renowned brand for their rum only to have the 
Communists steal it along with the rest of their property, including 
all of their production facilities.
  The Castro regime then embarked on decades of exploiting that IP, 
manufacturing and exporting rum using the ``Havana Club&#x27;&#x27; trademark 
they stole.
  The Arechabala family never recovered from what happened to them, but 
they transferred their rightful interests in their trademarks to the 
Bacardi family and company in the U.S.
  As a world leader when it comes to IP rights, it should be clear that 
the U.S. government would side with Bacardi in a dispute between them 
and the Castro regime over these trademarks.
  But in 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, 
recognized the Cuban regime&#x27;s claim on the ``Havana Club&#x27;&#x27; trademark 
even though it was stolen by the Cuban regime.
  That is why I introduced this bill, which prohibits the executive 
branch from recognizing, enforcing, or validating any trademark used in 
connection with a business or assets that were confiscated without the 
consent of the original owner or successor-in-interest.
  I was delighted to be joined by my Democratic colleague, Ms. 
Wasserman Schultz of Florida, in introducing it, and the bill has since 
been cosponsored by 17 other Members from both parties on the way to 
being overwhelmingly approved by the Judiciary Committee on a 
bipartisan basis.
  We all agree that the U.S. government should not reward those who 
would steal and exploit trademarks, or any other IP, without the 
consent of the legitimate owners.
  Allowing Cuba to propagate its misappropriation of IP also sets a 
harmful precedent for international IP protections.
  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this 
legislation.

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Chris Jones 
and his service to Virginia&#x27;s First District, commonly called 
``America&#x27;s First District&#x27;&#x27; and the Nation. This is both a moment of 
reflection and a time to express our heartfelt appreciation for a job 
well done.
  Chris began his career in public service as a District Representative

epitome of public service excellence, a dedication of over 20 years to 
the betterment of our community, our Commonwealth, and our nation. His 
journey has been one of tireless effort, navigation through the 
complexities of government--from the local, state, and federal--to 
serve citizens with grace, resilience, and an unyielding sense of 
purpose.
  During Chris&#x27; tenure, he has been a beacon of leadership, inspiring 
those around him to strive for excellence and to uphold the values that 
define our Congressional office and as a true Virginia gentleman. 
Chris&#x27; genuine concern for the well-being of America&#x27;s First District 
citizens, has left an indelible mark on all of us.
  Today is not only a farewell; it&#x27;s a moment to express our deepest 
gratitude. Chris&#x27; tireless dedication has set a standard for excellence 
that will be hard to match. His infectious enthusiasm will be sorely 
missed, but Chris&#x27; legacy will undoubtedly endure in the continued 
success of America&#x27;s First District constituent services.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the service and 
accomplishments of Chris Jones. May God bless Chris, and I look forward 
to seeing his continued success in the future.

          ST. MARY GRADE SCHOOL WINS FOURTH BLUE RIBBON AWARD

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 21, 2023

  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate St. Mary Grade 
School&#x27;s fourth Blue Ribbon Award. Located in Southwest Ohio and 
serving students across the region, St. Mary Grade School was founded 
by the Sisters of Charity. Opening its doors in 1908 with 100 students, 
the school has expanded and now has well over 400 students enrolled 
annually.
  The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program seeks to honor schools from 
around the country that have a vision of excellence and hold their 
students and faculty to a high standard, and I can&#x27;t think of a more 
worthy school than St. Mary Grade School. For over a century, this 
school has pushed each and every student to be the best they can be, 
academically and spiritually, and they continue to serve the local 
community to this day.
  I, like the thousands of other graduates who began their educational 
and spiritual journey at St. Mary Grade School, owe so much of our 
educational foundation to the dedicated faculty who have devoted years 
of their lives to ensuring that future generations of Ohioans will 
continue to prosper.
  I am incredibly proud that the National Blue Ribbon School Program 
has chosen my alma mater to be one of the forty private schools honored 
this year as the school is so deserving of this distinction. I am 
looking forward to their continued success in the community.
