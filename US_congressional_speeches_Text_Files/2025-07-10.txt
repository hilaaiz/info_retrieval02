               CELEBRATING ROY DRINKARD&#x27;S 105TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a special event that 
is occurring to celebrate and honor an extraordinary American and a 
dear personal friend: Mr. Roy Drinkard of Cullman, Alabama.
  This event is scheduled to occur on Friday, July 11, 2025. This will 
be an event to celebrate Mr. Drinkard&#x27;s 105th birthday as he personally 
plans to welcome family, friends, and acquaintances to his home in 
Cullman, Alabama.
  Born July 12, 1920, Mr, Drinkard is the oldest living United States 
Marine in the Nation, a proud veteran of World War II who served his 
country with courage and who continues to inspire all who know him.
  My wife, Caroline, and I plan to attend this momentous occasion and 
celebrate with Roy and all those in attendance.
  Mr. Drinkard remains actively engaged in his business and continues 
to serve on the Board of Trustees of Troy University, demonstrating 
that age is no barrier to leadership, commitment, or purpose.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and all of our colleagues pause for a 
moment in celebration on Friday as we celebrate the man and the life of 
Roy Drinkard and wish him a very happy 105th birthday.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fox Metro 
Water Reclamation District as they celebrate their 100th anniversary, 
marking a century of wastewater management and environmental 
stewardship.
  Founded in 1925 in Aurora, Illinois as the Aurora Sanitary District, 
this institution was established to protect public health and preserve 
the natural beauty of the Fox River from disease and pollution.
  By 1929, this vision became a reality with the construction of a 
wastewater treatment plant and supporting infrastructure. Over the past 
century, Fox Metro WRD has been a model of sustainability, fiscal 
responsibility, and environmental stewardship. The Fox Metro WRD has 
continually invested in innovation from solar power and nutrient 
reduction to recycling biosolids, restoring native landscapes, reusing 
treated effluent, and recovering methane gas for campus and public use.
  Fox Metro WRD now serves over 304,000 people across 90 square miles, 
operating twelve pump stations and more than 100 miles of intersecting 
sanitary sewers, They manage an 150-acre treatment facility where an 
average of 36 million gallons of wastewater is treated daily, ensuring 
the health and environmental protection of the Fox Valley region.
  For 100 years, the dedicated public servants of Fox Metro WRD have 
safeguarded public health, supported local economies, and helped 
eradicate deadly diseases.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the Fox Metro Water Reclamation 
District&#x27;s century of service, and I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating their remarkable contributions and continued commitment to 
protecting public health and our environment. I commend their vital 
contributions and congratulate them on a century of service to our 
communities.

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 50th 
anniversary of Lakes Region Community Services, a non-profit centered 
around meeting critical needs in New Hampshire.
  For more than 50 years, Lakes Region Community Services (LRCS) has 
been a pillar for providing crucial services in New Hampshire. Through 
a number of initiatives, LRCS has acted as a lifeline for so many 
people throughout New Hampshire. Whether through its Family Resource 
Center, Sober Parenting Journey, or Home Assist programs, thousands of 
Granite Staters are helped each year through this essential work.
  These programs assist people with developmental disabilities, 
acquired brain disorders, chronic illnesses, families with children, 
and our aging population. Community service organizations like LRCS 
play a vital role in creating a positive environment where people can 
grow and thrive in any stage of life. Covering 24 towns, LRCS has been 
a support system where people from across our communities can come and 
get the resources they need. I commend LRCS and its more than 300 
employees for the important work they do every day to positively impact 
people&#x27;s lives.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I want to say thank you and congratulate LRCS on 50 years of 
dedicated service to our state. We are grateful for your commitment to 
our community, and I look forward to continuing to support this life-
changing work.

            CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ROBERT L. ``BOB&#x27;&#x27; HANLEY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PETE STAUBER

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary 
life of Seaman Second Class Robert L. ``Bob&#x27;&#x27; Hanley, the last living 
survivor of the USS Houston, a member of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet sunk by 
the Imperial Japanese Navy in March 1942. Seaman Hanley showcased 
American grit, tenacity, and commitment in the fight against tyranny.
  As one of only 368 crewmen out of 1,060 to survive the sinking of the 
USS Houston, Bob Hanley faced unimaginable hardships as a prisoner of 
war four years. He endured the brutal Bataan Death March, where 64 men 
from Company D of the 194th Tank Regiment came from my district. Only 
34 survived. He was transported on ``hell ships&#x27;&#x27; to Singapore and 
Burma, and he labored on the infamous Thai-Burma Death Railway under 
conditions of starvation, torture, and beatings, without access to 
medicines or supplies. Battling dysentery, malaria, and pellagra, Bob&#x27;s 
resilience never wavered. At liberation in August 1945, he was among 
just 291 remaining survivors from the USS Houston.
  Bob&#x27;s service did not end with his Navy enlistment, which ended in 
1947 after six years. He continued serving his country by enlisting in 
the U.S. Army for 15 years. After his military career, he worked in 
security at 3M for another 15 years, retiring in 1978 due to medical 
reasons.
  Throughout his life, Bob&#x27;s deep faith as a devout member of the 
Catholic Church of Saint Peter in Forest Lake, Minnesota, guided him 
through the darkest times and brightest moments, serving as a 
cornerstone of his strength. On September 12, 2024, Seaman Second Class 
Robert L. Hanley passed away at 102 years old. May he rest in peace.

         HONORING LISA ROSE&#x27;S 42 YEARS OF BROADCAST EXCELLENCE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ERIC BURLISON

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lisa Rose, news 
anchor at Springfield, Missouri&#x27;s KY3 television station, who is 
retiring after 42 years of broadcast excellence. KY3 covers 32 counties 
in southwest Missouri and northwest Arkansas.
  Lisa&#x27;s fascination with the news began as a 3rd grader who was 
devouring the daily newspaper and increased even more when she was 10 
years old and witnessed televised reports about the Vietnam War. 
According to her, by the time she was in high school, she was truly 
addicted to learning as much as she could about what was going on in 
the world around her. So, it was no great surprise when she graduated 
from Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, with a 
Bachelors degree in TV News.
  Shortly after graduation, Lisa started her career as a general 
assignment news reporter at KODE-TV in Joplin, Missouri. She spent four 
years at KODE and then moved to KY3 in 1984 as the evening news anchor. 
During her time at KY3, she saw TV news reporting change as advanced 
technology allowed for live field reporting for the first time. 
Portable backpacks and satellite trucks became the norm as KY3 stayed 
ahead of the curve in broadcast news. Now a single individual can do 
what used to take a satellite truck, an engineer, a photographer, and a 
reporter to deliver a live report. From technology to techniques in 
news gathering, the station has been a leader in television news and 
Lisa has been there every step of the way.
  Lisa and her husband, Randy, have three children and three 
grandchildren. For more than four decades, she has been a trusted and 
familiar voice in our community where she&#x27;s brought professionalism, 
warmth, and a little humor into homes all across the Ozarks. I&#x27;d like 
to congratulate Lisa on her retirement, and thank her for her service 
to the community. She will be missed.

              HONORING THE BRAVERY OF THE U.S. COAST GUARD

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL CLOUD

                               of texas-

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary 
bravery and service demonstrated in response to the devastating 
flooding across Central Texas.
  Over the past several days, catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe 
and Colorado Rivers has shaken communities across the Texas Hill 
Country. Lives have been lost, others are still missing, and boots 
remain on the ground--searching, rescuing, and doing everything 
possible to bring families back together.
  On July 4, 2025, as the floodwaters surged near Hunt, Texas, the 
United States Coast Guard launched a rescue crew out of Air Station 
Corpus Christi at 5:30 a.m. Despite severe weather and three aborted 
attempts, the crew aboard an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter pushed through.
  That crew--Aircraft Commander Lieutenant Ian Hopper, Co-Pilot 
Lieutenant Blair Ogujiofor, Flight Mechanic Petty Officer Seth Reeves, 
and Rescue Swimmer Petty Officer Scott Ruskan--is a team of American 
heroes who carried out one of the most consequential rescue operations 
this country has ever seen.
  Petty Officer Ruskan was lowered into the flood zone and coordinated 
rescues for more than three hours, working with state, local, and 
military partners across three landing zones. In his first rescue 
mission, he helped save 165 lives--15 of whom were airlifted directly 
by the Coast Guard crew.
  This mission was one part of a larger operation, powered by 54 Coast 
Guard personnel rotating day and night to keep rescue efforts moving 
across the region. Every hour, lives are being saved by men and women 
who step into harm&#x27;s way so others can make it home. In the face of 
tragedy, we&#x27;re reminded of what makes this country strong: 
selflessness, courage, and Americans willing to step into danger to 
protect others.
  Texans are known for their resilience, but no one overcomes disaster 
alone. I thank every Coast Guardsman, first responder, and local 
official who acted swiftly and selflessly to help their neighbors.
  May God strengthen those still searching, comfort those who mourn, 
and bless the brave men and women who ran toward the rising waters.
  God bless Texas, and God bless the United States of America.

     HONORING THE CAPE VERDEAN INDEPENDENCE BIKE RIDE AND THE 50TH 
                ANNIVERSARY OF CAPE VERDE&#x27;S INDEPENDENCE

                                 ______

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Cape 
Verdean Independence Bike Ride as community members from across 
Southeastern Massachusetts and the country gather in New Bedford to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of Cape Verde&#x27;s independence.
  This deeply meaningful and historic ride not only commemorates Cape 
Verde&#x27;s independence from Portugal on July 5, 1975, but also celebrates 
the enduring strength, pride, and unity of the Cape Verdean-American 
community in New Bedford and beyond. The annual ride is a powerful 
intergenerational tradition, bringing families and neighbors together 
on a shared journey of remembrance, cultural pride, and collective joy.
  The Cape Verdean Independence Bike Ride was established by the Cape 
Verdean Universal Development Association (CUDA), a grassroots 
organization dedicated to promoting and preserving Cape Verdean 
culture. Under the leadership of Carleen Cordwell, then-President of 
CUDA, along with support from early advocates David Andrade and 
Benjamin ``Flip&#x27;&#x27; Rose and local organizations such as ``The Bomb,&#x27;&#x27; 
the ride first began as a fundraiser and community event in 1979.
  Together, the group envisioned the event being more than a bike ride. 
They imagined a celebration of identity and resilience; an act of 
cultural preservation rooted in community involvement. That vision took 
shape with the help of the ride&#x27;s dedicated founding members, including 
Carleen Cordwell, Diana Duarte, Jeanne Depina, Corday Faith Rivera, 
Buddy Andrade, Penny Santos, Susan Costa, Carol Pimental, Marilyn 
Halter, Liz DiCarlo, Jim Ryan, Lolly Pina, June Pina, Marie Monteiro, 
Debbie Santos Hudson, Jeanne Costa, Jackie Centeio, Bobby Grace, and 
Kenny Riberio. Their leadership and dedication laid the foundation for 
a tradition that continues to flourish today.
  The bike route guides participants throughout New Bedford&#x27;s historic 
West End and South End neighborhoods. These neighborhoods, with deep 
Cape Verdean roots, stand as testaments to the perseverance, 
contributions, and cultural richness of Cape Verdean-Americans. Riders 
of all ages choose between a 13-mile journey through the city or a 
three-mile route beginning at Monte&#x27;s Park, named in honor of Private 
First-Class Joseph J. Monte, the first Cape Verdean-American to receive 
the Purple Heart Medal.
  The annual bike ride fosters reflection on the struggles and triumphs 
of Cape Verdean independence, while recognizing the community&#x27;s ongoing 
contributions to the cultural fabric of New Bedford and the nation. The 
ride ends at Hazelwood Park with a celebration of Cape Verdean culture, 
featuring traditional food, music, games, and art. From the soulful 
sounds of morna and lively coladeira music to the sharing of culinary 
traditions passed down by generations, the event is a proud expression 
of Cape Verdean heritage. Through movement, storytelling, and music, 
the Cape Verdean Independence Bike Ride preserves cultural memory, 
honors historical milestones, and promotes social connections across 
generations.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the 50th 
anniversary of Cape Verde&#x27;s independence and commending all who have 
participated in and organized the Cape Verdean Independence Bike Ride 
for their enduring contributions to preserving cultural heritage and 
improving community life.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
remarkable life and legacy of Colonel Carlyle ``Smitty&#x27;&#x27; Harris, a true 
American hero. Colonel Harris, a retired United States Air Force 
officer, was 36 years old when his aircraft was shot down over North 
Vietnam on April 4, 1965. He became the sixth American taken as a 
prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
  Colonel Harris served this Nation with unwavering courage and 
strength. Following his capture, he endured more than eight years of 
brutal conditions, including torture and starvation. Yet, he never 
yielded to his captors. Instead, he put his military training into 
action, using the Tap Code to communicate with fellow prisoners and 
maintain unity, morale, and resistance.
  After returning home, Colonel Harris continued his service, leading 
and mentoring fellow airmen until his retirement from the Air Force in 
1979. His devotion to our Nation didn&#x27;t end with his military career--
he remained deeply involved in his community, lending his time and 
voice to numerous charitable and veteran-focused causes.
  In recognition of his service, I was honored to introduce H.R. 208, 
legislation that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2021, 
designating the United States Post Office in Tupelo, Mississippi, as 
the ``Colonel Carlyle ``Smitty&#x27;&#x27; Harris Post Office.&#x27;&#x27; That designation 
serves as a permanent tribute to a man who embodied the best of 
America.
  Colonel Harris passed away in hospice care on July 6, 2025, at the 
age of 96. Today, we remember his extraordinary service, enduring 
sacrifice, and lifelong commitment to his country and community.
  He is survived by his wife, Louise; their three children; 
grandchildren; and great-grandchildren.
  May his legacy of honor, resilience, and patriotism continue to 
inspire generations of Americans.

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
remarkable career of Craig Dellimore and to congratulate him on his 
upcoming retirement from WBBM Radio in Chicago.
  Craig has been a pillar of Chicago journalism for more than four 
decades. After studying journalism at Columbia University, he began his 
career covering Washington politics for the Associated Press before 
joining WBBM Radio in 1983.
  For 40 years, Craig has exemplified the highest standards of fairness 
and professionalism in political reporting. As the host of the weekly 
``At Issue&#x27;&#x27; radio show and Political Editor of WBBM News radio, Craig 
has covered every aspect of Chicago and national politics. Whether 
interviewing elected officials or unpacking complex topics like 
homelessness, mental health, and gun violence, Craig brings compassion, 
clarity and an unwavering commitment to the truth. His dedication to 
integrity earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Lisagor 
Awards, recognition from the Illinois Associated Press, and widespread 
respect across the state.
  Beyond the newsroom, Craig served his colleagues through leadership 
in the Chicago chapter of SAG-AFTRA, as both President and Vice 
President.
  From the halls of Congress to Chicago&#x27;s City Hall, Craig has been a 
trusted voice guiding listeners through a turbulent political landscape 
with clarity and insight.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to congratulate Craig Dellimore on his 
retirement and to thank him for his outstanding service to journalism

  RECOGNIZING ALAN BLEAM&#x27;S 40 YEARS OF SERVICE WITH PLUMSTEAD TOWNSHIP

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding constituent from my district, Mr. Alan Bleam. This year, 
Alan celebrates his 40th year with Plumstead Township. It is my 
distinct honor to commend him for four decades of resolute service to 
our community.
  A lifelong resident of Plumstead Township, Alan truly embodies the 
spirit of Plumsteadville. From attending Gayman Elementary to Middle 
Bucks Area Vocational Technical School, serving as a Junior 
Firefighter, and achieving the rank of Eagle Scout, Alan has always 
demonstrated a deep commitment to public service.
  In 1982, Alan became an Active Member of the Plumsteadville Volunteer 
Fire Company. Just three years later, he took on leadership roles both 
as Recording Secretary and First Lieutenant. Over the years, Alan&#x27;s 
service with the fire company was marked by a deep sense of duty--a 
reflection of his strong desire to serve and protect the community he&#x27;s 
always called home.
  In 1994, Alan assumed the role of Roadmaster for Plumstead Township, 
eventually rising to become the Director of Public Works--a position he 
holds with great pride to this day. His efforts have been integral in 
improving the township&#x27;s infrastructure and ensuring the high standard 
of living that residents have long depended on. In recognition

[[Page E661]]

of his contributions, he was named the Plumstead Township Employee of 
the Year in 1998.
  Yet, Alan&#x27;s impact reaches far beyond his professional endeavors. He 
is a man rooted in community--his circle of friends from square 
dancing, church, the fire company, scouting, and his own neighborhood 
speak volumes about his caring character and connection to others. He 
unites the people of this community and strengthens the bonds that make 
living in close-knit towns so special.
  In 1991, Alan married his true love, the late Desiree Bleam. Together 
they shared 32 years of love, laughter, and devotion. Alan stood by her 
side through her 13-year battle with Scleroderma, providing unwavering 
support and care, in both his personal and professional endeavors, Alan 
was a committed man--committed to his family and community.
  Today, I commemorate Alan Bleam for his 40 years of remarkable 
service for our community. His steadfast dedication to the betterment 
of Plumstead Township continues to inspire us all.

                      RECOGNIZING THEODORE M. RENZ

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 10, 2025

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Theodore M. 
Renz, who is retiring after nearly four decades of exceptional public 
service as the Executive Director of the Myrtle Avenue Business 
Improvement District (BID) in Ridgewood, Queens. Throughout his 
distinguished career, Mr. Renz has exemplified an unwavering commitment 
to community development, small business, and neighborhood 
revitalization, laying a strong foundation for a more vibrant community 
for future generations.
  Since the Myrtle Avenue BID&#x27;s establishment in 1988, Mr. Renz has 
been at the helm, guiding it through transformative growth. Recognizing 
the vital role that small businesses play in New York City&#x27;s economy, 
Mr. Renz has worked tirelessly to ensure that the BID serves as an 
accessible and indispensable resource for local entrepreneurs. Under 
his leadership, the BID supports more than 300 businesses along a mile-
long stretch of Myrtle Avenue, providing essential services including 
sanitation, public safety, beautification, and marketing that fosters a 
robust and welcoming commercial corridor.
  Mr. Renz&#x27;s tenure is marked by numerous accomplishments. He 
spearheaded major urban improvement projects, including a $2.4 million 
streetscape enhancement for Myrtle Avenue and played a pivotal role in 
helping secure a $55 million upgrade of the Myrtle-Wyckoff transit hub, 
enhancing accessibility for thousands of daily commuters and consumers. 
As an advocate for open space, he successfully championed the 
conversion of underutilized spaces into public plazas for the 
community. Today, the BID corridor is home to four new public plazas 
enjoyed by all.
  As a lifetime resident of Ridgewood, Mr. Renz public service extends 
beyond the BID. He has served as Executive Director of the Ridgewood 
Local Development Corporation (RLDC) and as a member of Queens 
Community Board 5, consistently advocating for small businesses, public 
safety, and quality-of-life improvements. His collaboration with city 
agencies, elected officials, and local stakeholders has left a lasting 
impact on the Ridgewood community.
  As Mr. Renz embarks on a well-earned retirement after 37 years of 
dedicated public

service, I extend my deepest gratitude for his leadership, and 
unwavering commitment to strengthening the economic fabric of New York 
City. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating Theodore M. Renz for his outstanding contributions and 
wishing him good health and joy in this next chapter of life.
