                   AUTOS DRIVE AMERICA 2023 DRIVE-IN

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. A. DREW FERGUSON IV

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2023

  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the career 
opportunities and economic contributions international automakers 
operating in my home state of Georgia have made to the state and local 
community. Auto workers from KIA and Hyundai that build vehicles in 
Georgia have come to Washington, D.C., advocating for policies that 
enable their employers to continue investing in their communities and 
American operations. These hard-working men and women are sharing their 
stories with us--how their jobs are more important than ever as our 
Nation rises to meet the challenges of a 21st century economy--and how 
American workers employed by international automakers are driving 
growth and innovation.
  But that leadership takes investment in American workers. Last year&#x27;s 
economic impact report from Autos Drive America found that, nationwide, 
international automakers employ more than 156,000 Americans, with two-
thirds of those jobs in manufacturing. In Georgia, these companies 
employ more than 6,000 Georgians across 30 facilities, in jobs like 
production, engineering, technical training, and many other career 
areas. In fact, 45 percent of all cars and trucks made in the United 
States today are built by international automakers, who have increased 
their U.S. production by more than 85 percent in the last 25 years 
alone.
  Mr. Speaker, as we recognized Manufacturing Month in October, let&#x27;s 
ensure we are doing all we can in this Chamber to enable international 
automakers to continue to invest in the United States and create 8,888 
careers in automotive manufacturing that has changed the lives and 
communities of those in my state.

                       Thursday, November 2, 2023

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today, I share an inspiring tale of 
dedication and unity surrounding the construction of a magnificent 
Hindu temple in central New Jersey, embodying the values of seva and 
bhakti. This temple, now celebrated as the largest Hindu temple outside 
India in the modern era, stands as a tribute to these enduring values. 
Crafted from marble and limestone, it required about 4.7 million hours 
of meticulous hand-carving by artisans and volunteers. These stones, 
originating from Italy and Bulgaria, traveled 8,000 miles to find their 
place in New Jersey. The Robbinsville temple is one of many built by 
the BAPS, a worldwide religious and civic organization within the 
Swaminarayan sect. This project exemplifies volunteerism, personal 
growth, and universal values that transcend religious boundaries. It 
symbolizes unity, service, and devotion, reflecting the core principles 
shared by people worldwide. May it serve as a reminder of the common 
values that bind humanity together, inspiring us to embrace unity, 
service, and devotion in our own lives.

                       Thursday, November 2, 2023

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Thomas Poulton for his 
achievement of the rank of Eagle Scout. Thomas is a senior at Kingsway 
Regional High School, and he has future plans to pursue a degree in 
business management. Thomas&#x27;s academic journey has been marked by 
excellence, with a particular passion for history, earning college 
credits through AP History classes. Outside the classroom, Thomas has 
been an active participant in sports, contributing to his school&#x27;s 
cross country, winter track, and tennis teams for three years. Thomas&#x27;s 
impressive 12-year scouting journey culminated in achieving the rank of 
Eagle Scout. His scouting journey is marked with countless hours of 
community service, numerous leadership positions, and endless outdoor 
adventures. For his Eagle Scout Project, he built a gaga pit for a 
local park, a project which he planned and executed himself from 
beginning to end. His scouting experience has shaped him into a fine 
young man, emphasizing leadership, a strong moral compass, and a 
dedication to positive societal influence. Thomas&#x27;s achievements are a 
source of pride for his family and his community, and I congratulate 
him on everything he has accomplished. God Bless Thomas and God Bless 
the United States of America.

  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Fatima High School on their victory in 
Missouri&#x27;s Class 3 Softball State Championship.
  The team claimed the Class 3 title for the second consecutive year by 
beating St. Francis Borgia 12-2. Senior Taylor Baumhoer led the way in 
the circle to finish her season with a sub-1.00 ERA as Fatima cruised 
in five innings. The Lady Comets have now won 68 of their 75 games in 
the past two seasons. The team should be commended for all their hard 
work throughout the past year and for bringing home another state 
championship to their school and community.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Fatima softball team 
for a job well done.

                      Wednesday, November 1, 2023

  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, while I strongly oppose a nuclear Iran, I 
will vote against this Resolution because it states that U.S. policy is 
``to use all means necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear 
weapon.&#x27;&#x27; That language allows for an open-ended war authorization, 
using all means necessary, which I deem inappropriate. I believe that 
America&#x27;s military commitments must be tied to clearly defined 
strategies, and vague war authorizations have, unfortunately, been used 
as justifications for unwarranted military actions in recent history. I 
will vote against this Resolution, the majority of which I agree with, 
because I do not want to see foreign policy mistakes mirrored.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this month, I had the honor of attending 
the New Jersey Dogs of Honor Graduation ceremony. The New Jersey Dogs 
of Honor is a nonprofit program founded in 2018 with a noble mission: 
to provide rescue service dogs, who faced the prospect of euthanasia, 
to military veterans diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress. This 
initiative is a collaborative effort involving Maurice River Township 
Firefighters, Ted&#x27;s Pet Country Club, Veterans Affairs, local 
businesses, and individuals who hold a deep appreciation for the 
courageous men and women who have served our nation. During the recent 
graduation ceremony on October 14th, we had the honor of witnessing the 
bond between these veterans and their loyal canine companions. On this 
day, we celebrated Roger Asher with his dog Gunny, Diana Pitman with 
Finn, Thomas Huck with Sasha, David Clemenko with Milo, William Hannum 
with Bailey, and Mario Bellasci with Tucker. These veterans and their 
dogs represent the spirit of resilience, hope, and companionship. As we 
commemorate this occasion, let us recognize the significance of such 
initiatives in supporting our veterans as they navigate the challenges 
of Post-Traumatic Stress. God Bless the Dogs of Honor and God Bless the 
United States of America.

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 2, 2023

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Alfred Poncia, 
who passed away at the age of 83 on August 28, 2023. Al was a farmer, 
conservationist, and respected community leader.
  Born on February 2, 1940, Al grew up on his family ranch in Marin 
County. He graduated from Tomales High School in 1958 and joined the 
Army National Guard. He later moved back home to work at his family&#x27;s 
dairy and study at Santa Rosa Junior College. While attending college, 
he met Cathie Brandeburg; they married in 1964 and settled down on the 
Poncia family farm in West Marin.
  While working on his farm, Al also took on leadership roles in both 
the county and state farm bureaus. He served 18 years on the Marin 
County Farm Bureau&#x27;s board of directors, including three years as board 
president. For decades, Al has been both a formal and informal leader 
in the local agriculturist community, notably leading efforts to 
protect open space and family farms in Marin County during successive 
attempts to develop rural West Marin.
  A passionate advocate and an adept communicator, Al worked with a 
variety of agricultural groups and committees dedicated to 
conservation, sustainable farming and ranching. He helped lead the 
Marin County Committee on Small Family Farms, a collection of both 
conservationists and agriculturists interested in developing solutions 
to water problems and fair milk prices. In 1971, Al participated in the 
California Agricultural Leadership Program, an advanced leadership 
development program for California agriculturists, where he had the 
opportunity to travel around the United States and the world, meeting 
with global leaders in farming to learn more about national and 
international agricultural policy.
  In 1981, Al became a founding board member of the Marin Agricultural 
Land Trust (MALT), the first farmland trust in the nation, representing 
a broad coalition of ranchers, environmentalists, and community leaders 
who were dedicated to protecting farming in Marin County. His 
expertise, insight, and passion were critical to MALT&#x27;s success at 
preserving local Marin County farms.
  Al is survived by his wife of 59 years, Cathie; three of their 
children, Jennifer, Melissa, and Loren; and eight grandchildren. Al was 
predeceased by his daughter, Jessica, and son-in-law, Bill. While he 
will be greatly missed, Al&#x27;s legacy will live on through the positive 
impact he had on his community and beyond.
  Today, thanks to Al&#x27;s lifelong dedication and hard work, Marin County 
stands as a national example for sustainable agriculture and open space 
preservation. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you join me in 
extending condolences to Al&#x27;s family and friends, and in expressing my 
appreciation for his decades of work for the public good.

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and commend TLC for 
Kids Sports, upon celebrating its 15th anniversary serving the Bay Area 
community. This outstanding achievement is a testament to the critical 
work that TLC for Kids Sports has accomplished to give every child the 
opportunity to safely participate in youth sports.
  Originally founded in 2009, TLC for Kids Sports is improving local 
communities and youth sports by transforming youth sports facilities in 
underserved neighborhoods. Its work across the Bay Area--including in 
Antioch, Martinez, and Richmond--helps ensure that every child, no 
matter where they live, can enjoy the countless benefits of team 
sports.
  TLC for Kids Sports is active in community outreach and frequently 
collaborates with local businesses and neighborhood volunteers, uniting 
participants in working toward the common goal of building a better 
future for our youth. Since its founding, over 5,000 volunteers have 
worked with TLC for Kids Sports to support communities in need and 
create safe environments where children can thrive.
  The fields built and restored by TLC for Kids Sports are places where 
our youth can learn sportsmanship, hard work, and confidence, 
empowering them with the knowledge and skills to build their future. 
TLC for Kids Sports plays a vital role in improving our communities, 
supporting our children, and giving youth the resources and space to 
grow.
  On behalf of the constituents of California&#x27;s Eighth Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate TLC for Kids Sports upon its 
15th anniversary and extend my sincere gratitude for its years of 
service to the Bay Area community.

                       Thursday, November 2, 2023

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a Lansing, Michigan-
based organization that is creating innovative partnerships to improve 
the future for Black residents by assisting them with the cost of 
higher education, starting a small business, or purchasing a home.
  Officially launched in 2022, the Justice League of Greater Lansing 
has worked tirelessly to engage the faith community in the area in 
dialogue over the historic harms done to African Americans through the 
institution of slavery in this country, and to foster greater 
understanding of its structural and systematic aftermath.
  Since the program&#x27;s launch, ten churches in Greater Lansing have 
either committed a percentage of their endowment funds, a lump sum 
donation, or regular contributions from the congregation as a whole 
and/or individual members to the effort. To date, the League has 
received more than $350,000, making it one of the most successful 
programs of its kind in the nation. That money will be used to provide 
scholarships for college-bound students, home loans for first-time 
buyers, and financial assistance for local entrepreneurs.
  Among the churches the League has successfully engaged, many of whom 
have been involved since the organization&#x27;s infancy, are First 
Presbyterian Church of Lansing; Edgewood United Church of Christ, East 
Lansing; All Saints Episcopal Church, East Lansing; First Presbyterian 
Church, Holt; and Red Cedar Friends Meeting, Lansing.
  I have had the pleasure of attending meetings of the Justice League 
of Greater Lansing, and its board members regularly participate in 
roundtables I host for faith leaders on gun violence prevention and on 
many other topics related to the betterment of the community. I applaud 
this organization&#x27;s commitment to justice, equality, and positive 
change through meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding. At a time 
where so many look to further tear the fabric of our society, I am very 
grateful for their thoughtful efforts to repair and strengthen it. I 
look forward to seeing how this project will continue to take root in 
the community.

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Dennis, 
Gartland &amp; Niergarth of Traverse City on their 50th Anniversary. A 
full-service accounting firm, Dennis, Gartland, &amp; Niergarth (DGN) are 
committed to serving the people of Northern Michigan and improving its 
communities.
  On October 1, 1973, the late Thomas Gartland founded the firm with an 
emphasis on teamwork and a focus on client success. Sticking to these 
founding principles, the company quickly became Northern Michigan&#x27;s 
largest, full-service, public accounting firm.
  For the past 50 years, DGN has been committed to elevating their 
clients, providing extraordinary attention to detail, and hands-on
