       CELEBRATING BOBBY STEPHEN&#x27;S ANNUAL ST. PATRICK&#x27;S DAY EVENT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHRIS PAPPAS

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, September 3, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Bobby 
Stephen&#x27;s Annual Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day event in Manchester, New 
Hampshire. Since its inception in 1978, this cherished tradition has 
brought together the community in a celebration that goes beyond mere 
festivity. Over the years, Bobby&#x27;s event has become a cornerstone of 
charitable giving in our state, raising funds to support educational 
opportunities for disadvantaged youth throughout New Hampshire.
  The origins of this event can be traced back to Bobby&#x27;s restaurant, 
the Vault, where a small gathering of friends and patrons first came 
together to celebrate Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. What began as a modest 
celebration has evolved into a significant fundraiser, drawing hundreds 
of attendees each year. Through the Bobby Stephen&#x27;s Fund for Education, 
the proceeds from this event have provided scholarships to New 
Hampshire citizens, enabling them to further their career goals through 
postsecondary education. Bobby&#x27;s unwavering dedication to this cause 
has made a tangible difference in the lives of countless students and 
their families.
  As we mark the grand finale of this event in its ``sunset&#x27;&#x27; year of 
2024, it is fitting to reflect on the enduring legacy that Bobby&#x27;s 
Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebration has created. Across four decades this 
event has not only raised over $500,000 in scholarships, it has also 
fostered a deep sense of community among its participants. The funds 
raised have empowered students, supported educational advancement, and 
reinforced the values of generosity and service that Bobby has 
championed throughout his life.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I want to extend my gratitude to Bobby Stephen for his 
exceptional commitment to our community. We thank Bobby for his 
tireless efforts and for creating a tradition that has touched so many 
lives. As this event comes to a close, its legacy will continue to 
inspire us all to join together in support of our youth and the future 
of our community.

                          ____________________

                       Tuesday, September 3, 2024

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I offer these remarks in honor of Emory &amp; 
Henry College head football coach Curt Newsome, who stepped down from 
his position this summer. Coach Newsome dedicated his life to the sport 
of football, earning coaching positions at several academic 
institutions throughout his career.
  Coach Newsome was born in Hampton, Virginia on October 29, 1958.
  His pursuit and interest in a career in football was great. He 
decided to move to the opposite end of Virginia to play at the 
collegiate level at Emory &amp; Henry College, now University. Coach 
Newsome played as a defensive tackle. Upon graduation, Mr. Newsome 
began a coaching career at Ervinton High School in Nora, Virginia.
  During a 16-year time span, the high schools of Ervinton, Kecoughtan, 
and Heritage benefitted from Coach Newsome&#x27;s leadership and drive. He 
received praise and recognition from fans, players and fellow coaches, 
resulting in his 1998 selection as the AP and VHSL Virginia State Coach 
of the Year.
  The coaching journey did not end there. His hard work caught the 
attention of Virginia universities and their football programs. Coach 
Newsome landed a coaching opportunity at James Madison University in 
1999.
  In 2004, he helped JMU reach the FCS National Championship game, 
where they would defeat Montana 31-21. This victory became JMU&#x27;s first 
NCAA Division I-AA championship.
  From 2006 to 2012, Coach Newsome worked for Virginia Tech football as 
an offensive line coach under Hall of Fame coach Frank Beamer before 
returning to JMU.
  In 2014, Coach Newsome became head football coach for his alma mater, 
Emory &amp; Henry. In his first season, Coach Newsome was named Old 
Dominion Athletic Conference Coach of the Year as he compiled an 8-2 
record for the Wasps that season.
  Coach Newsome compiled six winning seasons during his Emory &amp; Henry 
tenure as head coach and oversaw the team&#x27;s transition from NCAA 
Division III to NCAA Division II.
  His lifelong commitment to Virginia football and the players he 
coached is well documented, serving various coaching roles at the high 
school and collegiate levels.
  I wish my fraternity brother in Beta Lambda Zeta, Coach Newsome, well 
in his retirement. I thank him and Southwest Virginia thanks him for 
his contributions to the game of football in our region.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, September 3, 2024

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solemn remembrance of 
Arthur O. Eve, Jr., a remarkable individual, affectionately known to 
the people of Buffalo, New York, and beyond as ``Champ.&#x27;&#x27;
  As the beloved son of New York State Assembly Deputy Speaker Arthur 
O. Eve and an educator, Lee Constance Eve, life lessons in civic 
responsibility, faith, and a strong work ethic were taught early by his 
family.
  A standout football player who earned all-Catholic honors during his 
time at Canisius High School and shined on the field at the University 
of Texas at El Paso, Champ turned his athletic talent, natural 
leadership, and teambuilding skills into an opportunity to inspire and 
mentor countless young people through coaching at Calvary Baptist 
Church, Hutch Tech High School, and Buffalo State University.
  In his professional positions within a juvenile detention center and 
Educational Opportunity Center, Champ dedicated himself to empowering 
those in need. At Buffalo&#x27;s Municipal Housing Authority, Champ 
transformed the agency and set a national standard for compliance and 
inclusion, which led to the BMHA being recognized as a ``high 
performer&#x27; by the United States Department of Housing and Urban 
Development.
  Champ was a leader and respected voice on issues impacting Buffalo&#x27;s 
Black community, serving as President of the Black Student Union during 
his time at the University at Buffalo, and was the founder and 
President of the Unity Coalition, widely recognized as one of the 
strongest organizing units in the State of New York.
  As Deputy Commissioner of the Erie County Board of Elections and Vice 
Chair of the Erie County Democratic Committee, Champ supported 
democracy through his work, impressing upon others the power of a vote 
to express one&#x27;s values and shape our future. A man of great faith and 
devotion, Champ was an active member of Elim Christian Fellowship under 
the leadership of Bishop T. Anthony Bronner.
  Transcending his passion for the community was his love and devotion 
to his family. He leaves behind his father Arthur O. Eve, Sr., beloved 
wife Kim, nine children of Arthur III, Shiana Denise, LaNeesha, Eric 
James, Louis, Ashley, Melzetta, Bobby, and David Paul, and eight 
grandchildren Caiden, Rylee, Cailee, Kendall, Ari, Lucian, Maliha, and 
Lux, shared through their blended family, siblings Leecia, Eric, 
Malcolm, and Martin, and many aunts, uncles, and cousins.

[[Page E859]]

  As we remember Arthur O. Eve, Jr. we grieve the loss of a beloved 
friend, celebrate a life well lived, and find solace in knowing that 
his legacy of service lives on.

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of 
Barry Brown, who sadly passed away this August at 69 years old.
  Barry was a Savannah native through-and-through. After graduating

Savannah and Tybee Island communities.
  From serving on the Planning Commission, the City Council, and as 
Mayor Pro Tem, Barry&#x27;s natural-born leadership set a valuable example 
for everyone around him.
  Mr. Brown also faithfully served over 25 years on the Marine Rescue 
Squadron and belonged to both the American Legion Post 154 and the 
Tybee Island Republican Club.
  Mr Brown is survived by his wife Sunni, his son Brandon, and his four 
grandchildren. We deeply honor and thank Mr. Brown for his service to 
the Savannah and Tybee Island communities over the years.
  I send my most sincere condolences to the Brown family. They, along

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, September 3, 2024

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise along with my colleagues, 
Congresswoman Barbara Lee and Congressman Mark DeSaulnier, to recognize 
former California State Senate Majority Leader, San Leandro Mayor, and 
East Bay Regional Parks Director, Ellen Corbett, on the occasion of her 
passing on Friday, August 9, 2024, at the age of 69.
  Born in Oakland in 1954, Ellen was raised in San Leandro. She 
attended Chabot College, California State University, Hayward, and the 
University of California, Davis, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 
political science before earning her law degree from the University of 
the Pacific&#x27;s McGeorge School of Law.
  Ellen began her career as an attorney, community college professor, 
and civic activist before seeking public office in 1990 on the San 
Leandro City Council. Four years later, in 1994, she became San 
Leandro&#x27;s first-ever directly elected female mayor.
  In 1998, Ellen was elected to the State Assembly, representing 
California&#x27;s 19th district in the chamber until her term expired in 
2004. In 2006, she began her time at the California State Senate, 
representing District 10 until 2014. Ellen continued to blaze trails in 
the Senate as only the second woman ever to serve as the California 
Senate majority leader for 4 years.
  Under her tenure, Majority Leader Corbett authored over 160 bills 
that were signed into law tackling issues faced by everyday 
Californians. Those issues included infrastructure for public schools, 
expanding EV charging, child safety, marriage equality, and the 
California Homeowner Bill of Rights.
  Continuing her career in public service, Ellen was elected to the 
East Bay Regional Parks District Board of Directors, representing Ward 
4 until her passing. In this position, she was a fierce advocate for 
accessible open space. Serving as President of the Board, the Parks 
were in her capable hands during the first year of the pandemic.
  Throughout her life and career, Ellen was a tireless advocate for the 
communities she represented. She was a fierce environmentalist and a 
serial breaker of glass ceilings. Ellen was a person of consequence 
with a genuinely meaningful public service career. Our communities will 
deeply miss her presence. We send our deepest condolences to her son 
Ryan, as well as her other surviving family, friends, and former staff 
who were lucky to have her as their boss and mentor.

                            HON. ANDY HARRIS

                              of maryland

                       Tuesday, September 3, 2024

  Mr. HARRIS. Mr Speaker, two weeks ago I learned with great sadness 
about the passing of Sgt. Gordon F. Lee, a retired officer with the 
Easton Police Department who passed away on Monday, August 19, 2024, at 
the age of 46. During his time at the Easton Police Department, Sgt. 
Lee served with the K-9 unit, trained new officers and recruits as 
instructor and was a member of the department&#x27;s SWAT Critical Response 
Unit. Before that, he honorably served with the U S. Marine Corps. Sgt. 
Lee retired from active duty with the Easton Police Department in 
February of 2024.
  Sgt. Lee dedicated his life to helping others, putting his own life 
on the line to protect and serve the community he so much loved. His 
determination and hard work made him an outstanding leader, an 
excellent teacher and invaluable friend and mentor to so many in the 
Maryland police community and beyond.
  I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Lee family and 
the entire Easton Police Department. The Eastern Shore is forever 
grateful for Sgt. Lee&#x27;s commitment and dedication.

  INTRODUCTION OF THE PACIFIC DEFENSE SMALL BUSINESS INCENTIVE ACT OF 
                                  2024

                                 ______
                                 

                  HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN

                      of northern mariana islands

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, September 3, 2024

  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Pacific Defense Small 
Business Incentive Act of 2024, which would allow small businesses in 
the Pacific Insular Areas to become more active participants in the 
defense industrial base. Specifically, my legislation would authorize 
an incentive payment equal to five percent of a Department of Defense 
contract to prime contractors who subcontract to a small business 
concern in the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, or American Samoa.
  Providing access to defense contracts is critical, especially as the 
United States continues to execute its Indo-Pacific strategy, promoting 
a free-and-open region and defending Pacific Island interests. 
Empowering our small businesses located at the forefront of the Indo-
Pacific will not only streamline defense projects and initiatives but 
will also spur local economic growth in our U.S. Pacific Insular Areas.
  My bill, the Pacific Defense Small Business Incentive Act, seeks to 
bridge the gap between Pacific-based entrepreneurs and prime 
contractors throughout the United States by incentivizing strategic 
partnerships. Continued defense buildup in areas like the Marianas 
further necessitates the need for local business participation. This 
bipartisan legislation provides an impetus for contracting like the 
Indian Incentive Program authorized by Congress in 1988, which has been 
considerably impactful for Native American and Native Hawaiian small 
business concerns.
  The DOD Office of Small Business Programs under the Biden 
Administration has emphasized that America&#x27;s small businesses are 
``essential to U.S. national security&#x27;&#x27; and the ``heartbeat of the U.S. 
economy&#x27;&#x27;. I could not agree more but add that Pacific small businesses 
are indeed America&#x27;s small businesses.
  The gentlelady from American Samoa, Ms. Radewagen, is an original 
cosponsor of the bill. I urge all my colleagues to consider this 
crucial legislation and the elevation of Pacific small businesses in 
defense contracting.

Anderson, Jr. Mr. Anderson passed away on May 21, 2024. He served the 
people of Powell County as Judge-Executive.

important leadership position. He supported numerous worthy projects, 
including the creation of Hollerwood ATV Park, construction projects 
for the Emergency Dispatch and Operation Center, the Senior Citizens 
Center, the Animal Shelter, Recycling Center, and jail expansion 
projects. He worked on improving the infrastructure of Powell County by 
paving over 5 miles of gravel roads and being a part of over twenty 
bridge projects and flood mitigation projects. In 2019, Mr. Anderson 
was recognized by the Kentucky Association of Counties as the County 
Judge Executive of the Year.
  Mr. Anderson was a well-respected member of his community. He loved 
God and he loved his family. He was a member of Stanton Christian 
Church and the Powell County Lions Club. Mr. Anderson is survived by 
his wife Candace, his son James, and his daughter Josi.
  It is my honor to lift up the life of this dedicated public servant.

              RECOGNIZING THE RESIDENCE INN AMELIA ISLAND

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. AARON BEAN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, September 3, 2024

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, ``There&#x27;s no place like home&#x27;&#x27;, 
Dorothy once famously said, and it is so true. Most hotels are simply 
places for business travelers or tourists coming and going, but 
occasionally, some are so special we think of them as a home away from 
home.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of these special places: 
the Residence Inn on Amelia Island in the free state of Florida.
  The Residence Inn is perfectly situated in the heart of Amelia Island 
close to downtown, delightful shops and restaurants, and of course, the 
crystal blue surf that makes us a top destination. The Residence Inn is 
a great community partner, and under the leadership of General Manager 
Bob Hartman, they sponsor many events on the island, making it a better 
place to live and visit.
  The hotel is truly a home away from home for many travelers, and I 
experienced their hospitality firsthand. When our house was damaged by 
an unexpected fire, we lived in the Residence Inn for 6 months. The 
entire staff, from management to maintenance went above and beyond to 
make a difficult time for our family better, ensuring we felt at home. 
The folks at Residence Inn are true leaders of our state&#x27;s travel, 
hospitality, and tourism industries. I am profoundly grateful to their 
employees who welcome visitors with their positive attitudes and their 
exemplary services that always exceed expectations.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 
ribbon cutting for the Residence Inn refresh and many more years of 
excellence in the hospitality industry.
