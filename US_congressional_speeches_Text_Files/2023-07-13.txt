            ALASKA RAILROAD CORPORATION CENTENNIAL 1923-2023

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MARY SATTLER PELTOLA

                               of alaska

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Mrs. PELTOLA. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask my fellow Members of 
the 118th Congress to join the proud Members of the Alaska Delegation 
in congratulating and thanking the Alaska Railroad Corporation (ARRC) 
for 100 years of service to our State and to our Nation. The 
``Railroad,&#x27;&#x27; as we call it back home, and the builders, operators, and 
leaders that are its lifeblood, have been the backbone of the Last 
Frontier&#x27;s evolution. For the last century, the Railroad has been 
catalyzing economic development, supporting war efforts, transporting 
passengers between Alaska&#x27;s largest cities, helping build the Trans-
Alaska Pipeline, investing in real estate, and facilitating tourism and 
commerce across miles of remote and beautifully wild landscapes.
  Like Alaska itself, the Alaska Railroad story is full of peaks and 
valleys. The Alaska Central Railway (later renamed ``The Alaska 
Railroad&#x27;&#x27;) laid the first track in Alaska in 1903. It started in 
Seward and extended 50 miles north. The Alaska Central Railway 
reorganized in 1910 as the Alaska Northern Railway Co., later extending 
the railroad to Kern Creek--71 miles from Seward. In 1914, the U.S. 
Congress, noting it&#x27;s essential national importance, funded 
construction and operation of a railroad from Seward to Fairbanks at an 
estimated construction cost of $35 million.
  On July 15, 1923, President Warren G. Harding drove a golden spike in 
the ground at Nenana thereby connecting the track and marking the 
completion of the Alaska Railroad. From 1940-43, World War II brought 
large profits from hauling military and civilian supplies and 
materials. In 1962, the Alaska Railroad established its first car-barge 
service in Whittier, followed by train-ship service in June 1964, 
revolutionizing Alaska by enabling rail cars from the Lower 48 to be 
shipped to any point along the Alaska Railroad. In the early to mid-
1970s, the railroad supported construction of the Trans Alaska 
Pipeline, shipping and storing pipeline between Valdez, Seward, and 
Fairbanks, from which it was then trucked to the North Slope. In 1981, 
the Railroad entered into agreements with Fairbanks and Anchorage 
school district career centers for a tour guide program that trained 
high school students to serve as hosts onboard summer passenger trains.
  President Ronald Reagan penned into law the authorization of the 
transfer of the Alaska Railroad to the state in 1983. Officially, in 
1985, it became the property of the state, and the Alaska Railroad 
Corporation was born. By 1996, ARRC showed a profit of $8.0 million and 
passenger ridership had grown to 512,000. Former Governor Bill 
Sheffield became CEO in 1997. In the early 2000s, the ARRC&#x27;s real 
estate operations exceeded $11 million in profits for the first time 
and a web-based passenger reservation system was implemented. 
Simultaneously, the Railroad initiated a program to reduce diesel 
emissions and noise. And 2003 was the railroad&#x27;s most profitable and 
safe year in its history up until that point. In 2013, the Railroad&#x27;s 
own Bill O&#x27;Leary was named CEO, becoming the first lifelong Alaskan to 
lead the Railroad. Today, the ARRC operates a regularly scheduled 
public transportation service extending from Seward north through the 
traditional lands of the Alutiiq and the lands of the Athabascan 
groups: the Dena&#x27;ina, Ahtna, and Lower Tanana people. Passengers gain 
access to remote regions and areas off the road system and to the 
state&#x27;s public land treasures including the Chugach National Forest and 
Denali National Park, which are visited by hundreds of thousands of 
people annually. During the last 100 years, ARRC has proudly nurtured 
and promoted a relationship with the Alaska Native community. The ARRC 
team includes Native members throughout its history; from laborers 
during initial railroad construction between 1914 and 1923, to track 
maintenance during World War II, through to top leadership guiding 
corporate policy on the ARRC Board of Directors after state ownership.
  The Executive Team is comprised of President and CEO William G. 
O&#x27;Leary, CFO Michelle Maddox, COO Clark Hopp, Chief Counsel Andy 
Behrend, Vice President of Real Estate &amp; Facilities James W. Kubitz, 
Vice President of Marketing and Customer Service Dale Wade, Vice 
President Chief Engineer Brian Lindamood, and Chief HR Officer Jennifer 
Mergens.
  The Board of Directors are Ryan Anderson, Commissioner, Alaska 
Department of Transportation and Public Facilities; John Binkley, 
Chairman, Godspeed, Incorporated; T.J. Dinsmore, Conductor/Engineer, 
ARRC; ARRC Board Vice Chair: Judy Petry, President &amp; General Manager, 
Farmrail System; John Reeves, Owner, Fairbanks Gold Co., LLC; Julie 
Sande, Commissioner, Alaska Department of Commerce, Community &amp; 
Economic Development; ARRC Board Chair: John Shively, Chair, Pebble 
Mines Corporation.
  Throughout the Railroad&#x27;s storied history, the corporation&#x27;s team, as 
much as the iron and steel of the locomotives, has served as the 
foundational infrastructure driving economic development in my great 
state of Alaska. By carrying freight and passengers across wide 
expanses of wild plains, rivers, and mountains, and by harnessing human 
ingenuity and creativity, the Railroad has played an irreplaceable role 
in turning Alaska into a destination for tourists and new residents 
alike.

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the achievement the 
historic accomplishment of the Heroes&#x27; Alliance Vehicle Technology 
Team, a group of high school students from our district that won the 
2022 national Solar Car Challenge within their division.
  Heroes&#x27; Alliance was founded in 2009 by the late Pastor Reginald M. 
Lane, who established the organization in response to the educational 
and residential climates existing in the city of Detroit at that time. 
The Heroes&#x27; Alliance is a Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and 
Math (STEAM) program that challenges students to develop innovative 
technology focusing on renewable energy and automotive engineering. 
Today the project serves as a capstone for students who participate in 
the Heroes&#x27; Alliance Cooperative Learning Center, which utilizes 
vehicle technology for the basis of bringing together education, 
innovation, and industry as students work together to design and 
engineer a solar vehicle.
  This summer, their journey will culminate in the Solar Car Challenge, 
a cross-country race from Fort Worth, Texas to Palmdale, California. 
The students will face rigorous tests and evaluations to demonstrate 
the capabilities of their solar-powered vehicle. I am so proud of this 
hard-working and talented group of young people from various schools in 
Metro Detroit and want to congratulate them on their achievements.
  Please join me in recognizing Michigan&#x27;s Heroes&#x27; Alliance Vehicle 
Technology Team, as we cheer them on to victory.

                   CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT PIA KAUMA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the U.S. 
Helsinki Commission, last week I was grateful to serve as part of the 
leadership of the U.S. delegation to the 30th Annual Session of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe&#x27;s Parliamentary 
Assembly in Vancouver, Canada. There, I was joined by several of my 
Helsinki Commission colleagues, including Co-Chairman Sen. Ben Cardin 
and Ranking Members Rep. Steve Cohen and Sen. Roger Wicker.
  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe&#x27;s 
Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) is a forum that gathers hundreds of 
parliamentarians from 56 participating States of the OSCE several times 
a year to discuss the most pressing issues facing the transatlantic 
community. The Annual Session is the centerpiece of the Assembly&#x27;s work 
and is the one time a year when parliamentarians meet to debate, amend, 
and adopt resolutions on a range of topics as well as elect the 
Assembly&#x27;s leadership.
  Participating in the OSCE PA is an opportunity to demonstrate the 
American leadership on the world stage. Over the course of this Annual 
Session, we shared our diverse views, but our overwhelming message was 
about the unified, bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for Ukraine 
in its fight to defend its democracy and sovereignty against flagrant 
Russian aggression. Our friends in Canada and Europe deeply appreciated 
this reassurance of America&#x27;s resolve.
  The U.S. delegation participated in bilateral meetings with 
parliamentary delegations from Ukraine, Canada, and Germany, as well as 
a visiting delegation of legislators from the Western Hemisphere. My 
colleagues and I introduced amendments and resolutions encouraging our 
friends and allies to adopt specific policies that reflect our work in 
the U.S. Congress. Among these were texts based on the Ukraine Victory 
Resolution and the Holding Accountable Russian Mercenaries Act, both 
which I have sponsored in the House. Furthermore, I introduced a 
resolution with Congressman Chris Smith on addressing the phenomena of 
abuse, exploitation, and human trafficking of Ukrainian women and 
children stemming from Russia&#x27;s war. The AssembJy overwhelmingly 
adopted all these U.S.-led initiatives.
  Looking forward, I would like to congratulate those in the recent 
OSCE PA elections who will be assuming leadership duties for the coming 
year, while also thanking those who have ended their mandates. First, I 
want to applaud the election of Mrs. Pia Kauma of Finland as President 
of the Assembly. Mrs. Kauma has a long history of important 
contributions and strong relationships within the Assembly that will 
serve her well in this critical role. Additionally, I believe it is 
fitting that the PA should be led someone from NATO&#x27;s newest allied 
nation, galvanized by aggression to assume greater responsibility for 
European security. I also congratulate the Assembly&#x27;s three newly 
elected Vice Presidents: Mrs. Daniela De Ridder of Germany, Mr. Mykyta 
Poturaiev of Ukraine, and Mr. Kyriakos Hadjiyianni of Cyprus. I am 
especially delighted by the selection of Mr. Poturaiev whose voice has 
become the conscience of the Assembly since the outbreak of Russia&#x27;s 
full-scale invasion of his country last year. It is important to have 
greater Ukrainian representation in the Assembly&#x27;s upper ranks.
  I also extend my congratulations to the newly elected Treasurer, 
Mr.Johan Buser of Sweden, and officers of the three general committees: 
First Committee Chair, Mr. Richard Hudson of the United States, First 
Committee Vice-Chair Mr. Costel Neculai Dunava of Romania, First 
Committee Rapporteur Mr. Laurynas Kasciunas of Lithuania, Second 
Committee Chair Mr. Azay Guliyev of Azerbaijan, Second Committee Vice-
Chair Mr. Artur Gerasymov of Ukraine, Second Committee Rapporteur Mrs. 
Gudrun Kugler of Austria, Third Committee Chair Mrs. Lucie Potuckova of 
the Czech Republic, Third Committee Vice-Chair Mr. Sargis Khandanyan of 
Armenia, and Third Committee Rapporteur Mr. Malik Ben Achour of 
Belgium. Finally, I thank outgoing President Margareta Cederfelt of 
Sweden for her two years of tireless service to the Assembly, which 
involved capably leading the organization through the twin crises of 
COVID-19 and Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
  This team of elected officers that span the European continent and 
the political spectrum are assuming office at a critical time for 
transatlantic and global security. I look forward to cooperating with 
them closely in the coming year, particularly as I assume the 
responsibility of Head of Delegation for the United States in 2024.
  I want to express my deep appreciation to our Canadian hosts at the 
Annual Session in Vancouver, British Columbia, especially Dr. Hedy Fry, 
Head of the Canadian Delegation, who demonstrated tremendous 
hospitality and outstanding organization in orchestrating this large 
and complex event. The natural beauty, personal warmth, and cultural 
diversity we experienced in Vancouver made for an ideal setting for our 
meeting.

                          HONORING ANGELA MUND

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. NANCY MACE

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to Angela Mund, DNP, CRNA. 
Dr. Mund will soon complete her year as national president of the 
American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology (AANA). I am proud that 
Dr. Mund was elected as the 2022-2023 president of this prestigious 
healthcare organization.
  Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) are advanced practice 
registered nurses who administer more than 50 million anesthetics to 
patients each year. They work in every setting in which anesthesia is 
delivered including hospital surgical suites, obstetrical delivery 
rooms, ambulatory surgical centers, and the offices of dentists, 
podiatrists, and specialty surgeons. They also provide acute and 
chronic pain management services to patients in need of such care. 
CRNAs provide anesthesia for all types of surgical cases and are the 
sole anesthesia providers in many rural hospitals.
  CRNAs have full practice authority in the Army, Navy, and Air Force 
and are the predominant provider of anesthesia on forward surgical 
teams and in combat support hospitals.
  As a member of the AANA for 27 years, Dr. Mund has contributed 
greatly to the healthcare community in the Mount Pleasant area and 
nationwide. Dr. Mund&#x27;s career spans 19 years with roles at the 
University of Minnesota as well as the Medical University of South 
Carolina. Providing the diverse and interrelated perspectives of a 
leader, educator, advocate, and clinician, she has testified before 
state legislative bodies as well as the U.S. House of Representatives 
on the important role CRNAs play in providing safe, quality anesthesia 
care.
  Honorably discharged as captain from the U.S. Army Reserve Nurse 
Corps, Dr. Mund was previously the executive director of the 
Association of Veterans Affairs Nurse Anesthetists as well as its 
president.
  Dr. Mund earned her Doctor of Nursing Practice, Master of Science, 
and Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees from the University of 
Minnesota-Twin Cities. She completed her nurse anesthesia training at 
the Minneapolis Veteran&#x27;s Affairs Medical Center School of Nurse 
Anesthesia.
  During her AANA presidency, Dr. Mund has been a prominent advocate 
for the patients and practice of nurse anesthesia before federal 
agencies and members of Congress. She has worked tirelessly to promote 
anesthesia patient safety and the value of CRNAs to our healthcare 
system, especially at a time when that healthcare system has been hit 
hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Mund has advocated to eliminate 
burdensome regulations for CRNAs, to have CRNAs recognized as full 
practice providers in the Veterans Health Administration, and to 
address underlying causes of surprise billing such as provider 
discrimination.
  I extend my sincere congratulations to Dr. Mund today on a job well 
done. Her service to AANA and to her patients, and her commitment to 
safe, quality anesthesia care nationwide, are highly commendable. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Mund&#x27;s notable career and 
outstanding achievements.

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor Bruce Robert Vaughn, Specialist in Asian Affairs at the 
Congressional Research Service. Bruce passed away suddenly on Friday, 
March 17, at the height of a distinguished career serving Congress.
  Bruce served Congress in several roles, including in the Senate 
Treaty Review Support Office and on the staff of the Senate Select 
Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan 
Opposition. Beginning in 2003, he served for 20 years as an Analyst and 
then Specialist in Asian Affairs at the Congressional Research Service, 
bringing his considerable expertise in the Indo-Pacific region to bear 
on vital national security issues important for Congress. Bruce was a 
passionate and dedicated public servant who believed deeply in CRS&#x27;s 
mission to provide Congress with authoritative, non-partisan and 
intelligent analysis.
  Bruce brought deep historical understanding of the region. He advised 
Congress on the

[[Page E674]]

most important issues of the day, but never stopped thinking ahead. 
From early in his career, Bruce anticipated the importance of the 
Indian Ocean region and Oceania to U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific. 
Given the importance of the region to my constituents, Bruce was a 
valuable resource to me and my legislative staff in preparing for 
official travel, welcoming high-level delegations from the region and 
organizing briefings. Even after Bruce&#x27;s passing, staff and Members 
will continue to rely on his written analysis and expertise.
  I offer my sincere condolences to Bruce&#x27;s family, friends and 
colleagues at the Congressional Research Service, and hope they may 
take comfort in the knowledge of his indelible and ongoing contribution 
to the work of Congress. Congress has lost a distinguished public 
servant. I thank Bruce and honor his life and his work.

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to 
congratulate Union County Public Schools teacher, Dawn Helms Stegall, 
on her retirement after 48 years of serving Union County&#x27;s students and 
families. Dawn graduated from Piedmont High School in the class of 1972 
before attending both Wingate University for a degree in history, and 
Meredith College for a degree in social studies and secondary 
education.
  In 1975, Dawn started her teaching career at UCPS at Sun Valley, 
where she taught history for 10 years. She accepted a job at her alma 
mater, Piedmont High School, where she taught history for the next 38 
years. She was named UCPS Teacher of the Year for the 1989-1990 
academic year and was later named the Region IV Teacher of the Year. 
Year after year, Dawn&#x27;s students register among the highest scores for 
AP U.S. History. Dawn&#x27;s dedicated leadership in the classroom has 
inspired several of her students to further study history and return to 
teach in the UCPS system.
  Dawn&#x27;s years of service to the UCPS community also extends far beyond 
the classroom. Dawn helped start the Piedmont Barbecue in 1986 and 
continued every year until 2019. Over these years, the Barbecue has 
raised more than one hundred thousand dollars for Piedmont High 
students. It is clear, Dawn is the epitome of servant leadership.
  Once again, on behalf of the entire 8th Congressional District of 
North Carolina, I rise to congratulate Dawn Helms Stegall on a 
successful career and a well-deserved recognition for her years of 
dedicated service to Union County.

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in remembrance of John Durm, 
Marion County Sheriff Deputy, who died in the line of duty on July 10, 
2023, at the age of 61. He is survived by his wife, Ramona, and 4 
children.
  Deputy Durm was well liked and respected by all who had the privilege 
of knowing him. Described by his colleagues and friends as genuine, 
courteous, and sincere, Deputy Durm always had a smile and joke to 
brighten someone&#x27;s day.
  A shining example of what it means to serve and protect, Deputy Durm 
worked in the Marion County Sheriff&#x27;s department for 38 years, 
alongside his wife. Inspired by their service, 1 of their sons is 
currently training at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy.
  Our community mourns the loss of a brave and selfless man who was 
dedicated to his family and the community he served. He lived out his 
values every day. Deputy Durm&#x27;s legacy of service and friendship will 
be remembered by family, community members, and his Marion County 
Sheriff&#x27;s Office coworkers. Today, I solemnly ask my colleagues to join

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of Mr. Francis Albert 
Smith of Palm Coast, Florida, who, on July 18, 2023, will celebrate his 
100th birthday.
  Throughout his life, Mr. Smith has been unwavering and relentless in 
his service to the United States. Serving in the Pacific during WWII, 
taking part in the Invasion of Ie Shima during the Okinawa Campaign, 
and in his role

[[Page E671]]

as a Staff Sergeant in the Armed Forces from 1942 to 1946, Mr. Smith&#x27;s 
service falls nothing short of true servant leadership.
  Mr. Smith was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1923. Throughout his life, 
he has taken on many roles, including that of husband, father, 
grandfather, and great grandfather. In 1944, he married Ms. Dorothy 
Murtha, and became the father of 4 wonderful children, Barbara, Diane, 
Douglas, and David. Over the years, his family has continued to grow, 
and now includes 11 grandchildren and 22 great grandchildren. In 2006, 
Mr. Smith married Gretta Woodward, a fellow veteran of WWII.
  Mr. Smith&#x27;s service was, and remains, essential to maintaining the 
freedoms we as Americans are so fortunate to enjoy. Again, I thank him 
for his dedication and commitment to the United States of America.
  Every American owes a debt of gratitude to him. His dedication and 
courage in uniform helped to ensure the safety and prosperity of this 
Nation and all the people in it.
  Happy Birthday to Mr. Francis Albert Smith. Here is to many more.

  HONORING SISTER RICHELLE FRIEDMAN FOR HER OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my heartfelt 
congratulations and deepest thanks to Sister Richelle Friedman, PBVM, 
as the Coalition on Human Needs honors her as their 2023 Human Needs 
Hero, for her years of extraordinary advocacy, analysis, coalition 
building, and leadership on a wide range of issues at the federal 
level.
  Since arriving in Washington, DC in 1980, Sister Richelle has been a 
passionate champion and a tireless advocate for all Americans most in 
need. For more than 30 years Sister Richelle has focused her energies 
and commitment to expanding opportunities for people

[[Page E672]]

experiencing poverty and other vulnerable populations. She fought for 
justice through her years of work at NETWORK, a Catholic Social Justice 
Lobby, the McAuley Institute, the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, and the 
Coalition on Human Needs. As the founder and leader of the SAVE for All 
Campaign (Strengthening America&#x27;s Values and Economy for All), Sister 
Richelle has been a driving force for better public policy and an 
essential educator for Members on human needs programs, which is key in 
promoting and enacting good public policy.
  Over the years, I have been proud to work with Sister Richelle 
Friedman on programs of mutual interest and concern. She has been a 
tireless champion of meeting human needs through investments in housing 
and programs to reduce poverty and hunger. She has been a strong voice 
of conscience, urging Congress towards equity, demanding that the rich 
and corporate interests pay their fair share of taxes and do not profit 
unfairly from government contracts. Sister Richelle has unfailingly 
conveyed reliable evidence that increasing tax credits for low- and 
moderate-income families, expanding access to food assistance and 
health insurance, ensuring justice for immigrants, and building 
economic opportunity for all are investments that help our nation move 
forward, leaving no one behind.
  Through her decades of advocacy, she has helped members of Congress 
understand that increased wages, family supports such as childcare and 
paid leave, adequate retirement benefits and civil rights protections 
are the goals we must reach, no matter how long it takes. As a stalwart 
defender of the needs of those experiencing poverty, Sister Richelle 
has earned the praise of fellow advocacy organizations, the respect of 
ideological opponents, and the friendship of many of us on Capitol 
Hill.
  I am honored to have this opportunity to stand today and pay tribute 
to Sister Richelle Friedman for her hard work and thank her for her 
commitment to social justice. She has left an indelible mark and set a 
standard of compassion, service, and advocacy to which we should all 
strive.

               HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF DR. PATTI LISK

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Patti 
Liski, Dean of Nursing and Health Technologies at Germanna Community 
College, on a remarkable career as a nurse, educator, and community 
college advocate.
  Nearly 40 years ago, Dr. Lisk started her career at Germanna when she 
joined as a nursing faculty member in 1983. In 1986, she transitioned 
to full-time teaching. During her time at Germanna, Dr. Lisk has been 
credited with revolutionizing the school&#x27;s nursing program and building 
a statewide on line nursing program. Her work writing the original 
grant for the purchase of human patient simulators brought cutting-edge 
technology to the school and kickstarted Germanna&#x27;s Virtual Hospital. 
In 2013, after the passing of Dean Mary Gilkey, Dr. Lisk rose to the 
occasion after her emergency appointment to Dean of Nursing and Health 
Technologies, and in that role has helped further expand the mission of 
Germanna&#x27;s nursing program.
  Dr. Lisk has also served as a fierce advocate for the promise and 
potential that lies within America&#x27;s community colleges. She has seized 
the opportunity to help students, many identifying as firstgeneration 
students, navigate the college process and become successful nurses. 
Her personal investment in supporting students through every step of 
their journey is admirable and has had a profound impact on the quality 
of nurses graduating from Germanna.
  As seen by her numerous professional awards and accolades, Dr. Lisk 
has had an exceptional career. She has positively impacted the lives of 
thousands of nurses, creating a ripple effect to be felt for 
generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, as the U.S. Representative for Virginia&#x27;s Seventh 
District, I am proud to represent dedicated individuals like Dr. Patti 
Lisk. I would like to congratulate her on an exceptional career and 
wish her the best on a well-earned retirement.

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Colonel Matthew 
W. Luzzatto on his retirement from the United States Army after more 
than 25 years of service. COL Luzzatto has exemplified honor, 
integrity, and professionalism throughout his career and his service is 
truly deserving of this body&#x27;s recognition.
  Throughout his decorated career, COL Luzzatto has held various 
command and officer positions, including Assistant Secretary of the 
Army for Civil Works, Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
Charleston District, and Chief of the Host National Funded Construction 
for U.S. Forces Japan, Yokota Air Base, and has served the country in 
deployments to Kosovo and Kirkuk, among others. His experience, 
knowledge, and initiative have distinguished COL Luzzatto as an 
outstanding leader who has upheld the core values and mission of the 
U.S. Army and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
  As Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, 
COL Luzzatto has been a valuable partner to my office and the 
community. Together, we have worked on projects to reduce storm and 
coastal flood risks to protect residents, properties, and 
infrastructure. He has overseen vital beach replenishment, dredging, 
and flood control projects, working in coordination with federal, 
state, and local entities. It has been an honor to work with COL 
Luzzatto to protect our communities, and I thank him for his 
leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, once again, it is my sincere honor to pay tribute to 
Colonel Matthew Luzzatto for his years of service to the United States 
Army. I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in thanking COL 
Luzzatto for his honorable service to our great nation.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DORIS O. MATSUI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise to 
honor the life and service of my former intern, Mari Tisera, who passed 
away on June 6, 2023, at the age of 20. Mari&#x27;s legacy will be 
remembered through her passion and dedication for helping marginalized 
and underserved communities and her kindness to all those she knew.
  Mari Tisera was born on July 29, 2002, into a family that emigrated 
from Argentina to the United States 2 years earlier. Mari&#x27;s family 
moved to the United States in order to provide Mari and her 3 older 
brothers better opportunities and a stronger future. Raised in Front 
Royal, Virginia, Mari was a standout student at Wakefield Country Day 
School in Huntly, Virginia, where she excelled in a variety of academic 
subjects, served her community, and was a fierce athlete. Some of 
Mari&#x27;s many accomplishments include being chosen by all the coaches in 
her volleyball league for the Delany Athletic Conference All-Conference 
Team and working hard as a leader in student government. A first-
generation Argentinian American, Mari enjoyed volunteering at a local 
elementary school as a Spanish to English translator for summer school 
students who were learning English as a second language.
  Mari attended George Mason University, where she studied Spanish and 
Government and was a sweetheart for Zeta Psi, a position that she was 
very proud of because of the love and goodness that she was 
contributing to the fraternity. She dreamed of being a lawyer and had 
always been passionate about the ethics of law and government. Mari&#x27;s 
dedication to serving all communities and for standing up for what is 
right continued in college. She organized marches for women&#x27;s, LGBTQ, 
and Black rights, and continually fought for the rights of the 
unhoused.
  It was wonderful having Mari serve in my Capitol Hill office at the 
end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. She worked hard, was eager to 
learn, and served my constituents and all visitors with kindness and 
warmth. I know that Mari has said that all of us in the office had a 
positive impact on her, but she also had a positive impact on all of us 
who worked with her that we will never forget. Mari wanted to come back 
and work in our office after she graduated, and it would have been an 
honor to have her back on our team.
  Mr. Speaker, today we honor Mari Tisera and the many hearts that she 
has touched as a daughter, sister, aunt, friend, leader, and advocate. 
Her vibrant spirit, enduring determination, and genuine kindness should 
serve as an example to all of us of what it means to be a good person 
in this world.

  REINTRODUCTION OF THE AMERICAN FOOD FOR AMERICAN SCHOOLS ACT OF 2023

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 13, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I reintroduce the ``American Food 
for American Schools Act.&#x27;&#x27; I thank Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) for his 
support as the original cosponsor and U.S. Senators, Mike Braun (R-IN), 
and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), for sponsoring the companion.
  This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would strengthen enforcement 
of the existing ``Buy American&#x27;&#x27; requirements under the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture&#x27;s (USDA) in-school meal programs. Current law requires 
school districts to purchase domestically sourced food products for all 
federally funded in-school meals and afterschool snacks under the 
National School Lunch Program. However, even in agricultural 
communities like California&#x27;s Central Valley, school districts continue 
to misuse taxpayer dollars to buy imported foods, unnecessarily, 
without informing parents. In numerous cases, these same imported foods 
have been recalled due to safety concerns and outbreaks of foodborne 
diseases. This is especially troubling as those same foods could have 
been sourced locally in the first place as required by federal law.
  That is why our bipartisan bill would increase public transparency by 
allowing parents to know from where the food served to their children 
in school comes. School districts would be required to obtain a waiver 
from USDA to use federal taxpayer dollars to purchase foreign-sourced 
food products, when unavailable domestically. By requiring USDA to post 
on line all waivers granted for purchases of foreign-sourced foods 
served to students, our bill would provide American farmers the 
opportunity to seek out school districts in need of affordable, 
domestically grown foods.
  In the 115th Congress, we included a ``Buy American&#x27;&#x27; enforcement 
provision for the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Program in 
the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-334), commonly 
known as the 2018 Farm Bill. We also clarified the seafood caught by 
Untied States-flag vessels or within our Exclusive Economic Zone at sea 
are domestically sourced foods for the USDA in-school meal programs. 
This was a first step in addressing this critical issue for American 
farmers and parents with school-age children. Now, Congress needs to 
finish the job by passing our ``American Food for American Schools 
Act&#x27;&#x27; into law.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join us in cosponsoring the 
``American Food for American Schools Act.&#x27;&#x27; Our Nation&#x27;s schoolchildren 
should be served nutritious, American-grown foods produced under the 
strictest food safety standards in the world, as required by federal 
law. That is exactly what our bill would accomplish. I look forward to 
working with the Committee on Education and Labor to ensure that our 
bipartisan bill is included in any future Child Nutrition 
Reauthorization or the upcoming Farm Bill.
