          CONGRATULATING THE TABB HIGH SCHOOL TIGERS GOLF TEAM

                                  _____
                                 

                         HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Tabb High 
School Tigers Golf Team of York County, Virginia, for winning the 
Virginia Class 3, Region A Golf Championship--their first regional 
title since 2001.
  The Tigers were led by Cooper Guldin, whose round of 74 earned him 
the individual medalist honor followed by outstanding performances from 
Jack Houseknecht and Brodi Bartee, who each contributed standout 
performances shooting their lowest scores of the season, Ethan 
Thompson, Chriss Bassett, and Ainsley Asbury.
  Competing among seven strong teams at Dogwood Trace Golf Course in 
Petersburg, the Tigers captured the championship by narrowly edging 
York High School by just three shots for the victory. This hard-fought 
win secured Tabb a well-earned berth in the Virginia High School League 
(VHSL) state tournament and marked a historic return to regional 
prominence for the golf team.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in congratulating the Tabb High 
School Tigers Golf Team of York County, Virginia. May they continue to 
represent their school with great pride.

                          ____________________

  Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend

church&#x27;s childcare center, provided food assistance to more than 5,000 
families through the Manna from Heaven Food Pantry, and hosted a COVID-
19 vaccine clinic during a time of great need. Their partnerships with 
small and minority-owned businesses, schools, nonprofits, and civic 
organizations have created lasting connections that continue to uplift 
lives across the region.
  Mr. Speaker, Bishop Leslie Patterson, Jr. and Co-Pastor Dr. Francene 
Patterson exemplify what it means to lead with faith and purpose. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on this milestone 
anniversary and commending their outstanding service to their

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Latyna Young, 
recognized as one of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of 
the Year. Dr. Young is a lifelong educator, community leader, and 
advocate whose 45-year career in education has left an enduring mark on 
Vallejo and Solano County. Elected to the Vallejo City Unified School 
District Board of Trustees in 2020, where she represents Area 4, Dr. 
Young&#x27;s leadership reflects her deep commitment to equity, empowerment, 
and excellence in education. A proud graduate of Vallejo schools 
herself, she began her career in the same district as a teacher before 
serving as coordinator, vice principal, principal, and director of 
student support services. Though retired from full-time service, she 
continues to champion educational opportunity and student success as a 
trustee and mentor to the next generation of educators. Beyond her 
service to the school district, Dr. Young is President of Fighting Back 
Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending poverty and 
strengthening families in Vallejo and across Solano County. She is also 
an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. (Kappa Beta Omega 
Chapter), the California Association of African American 
Superintendents and Administrators (CAAASA), and the Solano-Napa 
Chapter of Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA). Dr. 
Young&#x27;s academic achievements are as impressive as her professional 
record--holding two master&#x27;s degrees, in early childhood and special 
education from Sonoma State University and in counseling from the 
University of La Verne, along with a doctorate in educational 
leadership in urban schools. Her lifetime of service embodies 
perseverance, compassion, and faith in the transformative power of 
education. On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional 
District, I am proud to honor Dr. Latyna Young for her remarkable 
leadership, her dedication to the Vallejo community, and her lifelong 
commitment to public service.

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
contributions of Lt. Col. Brenda Strength as she is honored as one of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year for her 
exceptional leadership, operational excellence, and dedicated service 
to both the United States Air Force and the Northern California 
community. Lt. Col. Strength leads a team of 372 military and civilian 
personnel in managing the Air Mobility Command&#x27;s largest logistics 
portfolio, valued at over $983 million. Under her leadership, her unit 
executed over 58,000 passenger movements and transported more than 5 
million pounds of cargo, while simultaneously planning and executing 12 
high-priority Presidential support missions, mobilizing 123 personnel 
across 22 locations in less than 24 hours. She played a pivotal role in 
finalizing a 15-year modernization effort involving the transfer of 
3,000 legacy weapons systems across three wings. Through innovative 
joint training with the U.S. Marine Corps, she established three cross-
service exercises and embedded 25 Air Force reservists into five 
critical logistics functions, enhancing operational readiness and joint 
interoperability. Her logistical acumen led to major advancements: a 30 
percent reduction in overdue parts in the ``Due In From Maintenance&#x27;&#x27; 
program, a 15 percent increase in Specialized Fueling qualifications, 
and the resolution of a vital Base Exchange agreement benefiting over 
135,000 members of the Travis AFB community. Further demonstrating her 
strategic foresight, Lt. Col. Strength oversaw a zero-cost warehouse 
floor plan redesign that consolidated 124 locations for 11,000 line 
items, resolved 132 asset discrepancies, and bolstered the Air Force&#x27;s 
largest mobility account. Her innovation directly enabled a 26 percent 
increase in qualified aircrew by resolving a 9-month gap in hot refuel 
kit certification. Beyond her military service. Lt. Col. Strength has 
strengthened community bonds by encouraging squadron engagement in 
local volunteerism, including youth mentorship, highway cleanups, STEM 
and robotics initiatives, and support for local athletics and the arts. 
Her commitment to community partnerships highlights the Air Force&#x27;s 
enduring connection to the people it serves. On behalf of the people of 
California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and 
recognize Lt. Col. Brenda Strength for her invaluable contributions to 
our community.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to 
honor a trailblazer in Alaska&#x27;s sports history, Scott Gomez for his 
induction into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. As the first 
Alaskan to receive this extraordinary distinction, Mr. Gomez has not 
only broken barriers in the world of professional hockey but has also 
served as a role model for generations of young Alaskans.
  Born in Anchorage and a graduate of East Anchorage High School, Mr. 
Gomez rose swiftly through the ranks of professional hockey. He made an 
immediate impact in his rookie season with the New Jersey Devils, by 
winning the NHL&#x27;s Calder Memorial Trophy. His career would go on to 
include two Stanley Cup championships, over 1,000 games in the NHL, and 
international representation with Team USA at the Winter Olympics.
  Beyond his accolades on the ice, Mr. Gomez&#x27;s legacy is defined by his 
commitment to community. During the 2012 NHL lockout, while many of his 
peers played overseas, he returned home to Alaska to play in front of 
local fans. He has continued to mentor youth and invest in the sport 
through coaching roles, including his current position with the USHL&#x27;s 
Surrey Eagles.
  Mr. Gomez also founded the Scott Gomez Foundation, which is dedicated 
to promoting youth hockey and increasing opportunities for underserved 
communities. Through scholarships, clinics, and community work, the 
foundation reflects his deep commitment to giving back and uplifting 
the next generation of players.
  Scott Gomez embodies the values of perseverance, excellence, and 
service that make Alaska proud. His journey from local rinks to 
national recognition reflects the very best of our state&#x27;s spirit of 
optimism, hard work, and generosity. I offer my congratulations on this 
well-deserved honor and thank him for the inspiration he continues to 
provide both on and off the ice.

                               of hawaii

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express gratitude and support 
for our Nation&#x27;s vibrant immigrant community on this National 
Immigrants Day.
  Every October 28th, we recognize and celebrate the contributions of 
immigrants--born citizens of another country--to our United States. Our 
Nation stands as the country with the most immigrants in the world: 
over 52 million in 2024, or about 15 percent of our overall population. 
Throughout our history immigrants have made, and today continue to 
make, invaluable contributions to our country, including invigorating 
our economy and sharing their unique cultures to enrich the fabric of 
our society.
  Nowhere is this truer than in my Hawaii, where so many are themselves 
immigrants or descended from immigrants. Hawaii is home today to 
256,000 immigrants, or about 18 percent of our total population--
ranking us 8th in the Nation. Immigrants have been central to the 
history and culture of Hawaii for centuries, from being the backbone of 
our labor force in Hawaii&#x27;s earlier agricultural industries in sugar 
and pineapple, to now making up 22 percent of our labor force and a 
disproportionately large share of our vital hospitality and health care 
industries as well as our dominant small businesses. Our distinctive 
multicultural identity, from ``pidgin&#x27;&#x27; to fusion foods like spam 
musubi, meat jun and saimin, to our distinctly local music and way of 
life, have been uniquely shaped by our immigrant `ohana.
  Nationally, the immigrant experience then and now has strengthened 
our country immeasurably in equally multiple ways. In pure economic 
terms alone, in 2022 immigrants generated some $1.6 trillion in 
economic activity and contributed more than $579 billion in local, 
state and federal taxes, and today millions of American workers are 
employed at immigrant-founded and immigrant-owned companies. 
Immigration is and will increasingly be essential to meeting workplace 
demand. Our immigrant communities maintain ties to their countries of 
origin and thus strengthen our Nation&#x27;s indispensable international 
bonds.
  At a time when too many immigrant communities here and elsewhere are 
being unfairly targeted and villainized, it is more important than ever 
that we recognize, celebrate and extend our support to our dynamic, 
diverse and thriving immigrant community and thank all immigrants for 
your belief in and contributions to our country. Mahalo.

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and legacy of Margaret Hopson Brown, a beloved member of our 
community whose warmth and kindness touched the lives of many. Born on 
December 19, 1954, to David and Mary Hopson, Margaret lived a life rich 
with love, adventure, and purpose.
  Margaret passed away on September 8, 2025, leaving behind a legacy of 
love and laughter. A Celebration of Life service was held on Saturday, 
September 13, 2025, at Valley Queen M.B. Church, officiated by Rev. 
Lesta Anderson and Rev. Dexter Davis, with interment at Booker 
Cemetery.
  Margaret was a lifelong member of Shady Grove M.B. Church, where she 
served faithfully, embodying the spirit of a true servant of the Lord. 
Her life was a testament to her faith, as she accepted Christ at an 
early age and lived out her beliefs through acts of kindness and 
service.
  Known for her ability to turn everyday moments into celebrations, 
Margaret&#x27;s presence was a gift to all who knew her. Whether she was 
spinning wild stories, sharing a perfect joke, or ensuring no one left 
her table hungry, Margaret&#x27;s warmth drew people in and made strangers 
feel like lifelong friends.
  Margaret was preceded in death by her parents; her husband Royal 
Brown, Jr.; and five siblings. She leaves behind a loving family, 
including her four sisters, Dorothy, Frances, Brenda, and Pinky; her 
brother, Andrew Lee; and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, aunts, and 
special friends, including the Class of 1970 and the Golden Hearts 
Social club.
  Though Margaret&#x27;s time with us has ended, her story lives on in every 
lesson taught, every memory shared, and every heart she touched. Her 
legacy is proof that some people never truly leave us.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of 
Margaret Hopson Brown, whose kindness, resilience, and love will 
continue to inspire us all.

                HONORING THE REPUBLIC DAY OF KAZAKHSTAN

                                  _____
                                 

                       HON. SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE. Mr. Speaker, as Ranking Member of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on South and Central Asia, I 
rise today alongside my colleague and Chair, Mr. Huizenga of Michigan, 
to honor and congratulate the people of Kazakhstan as they mark the 
Republic Day of Kazakhstan, which commemorates Kazakhstan&#x27;s declaration 
of sovereignty independent of the Soviet Union on October 25, 1990. The 
United States has remained committed to Kazakhstan&#x27;s sovereignty, 
independence, and territorial integrity. Now, as a valued strategic 
partner of the United States, our nations work together to advance 
security, peace, and prosperity.
  Kazakhstan inherited a massive nuclear stockpile and legacy sites for 
chemical and biological weapons research following the dissolution of 
the Soviet Union. The voluntary commitment to rapidly remove these 
weapons from its territory and accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty 
and other key arms control measures was a model for the region and the 
world. Kazakhstan has also made significant contributions to UN 
peacekeeping missions, including independent deployments of 
peacekeepers from 2024. These efforts support stability and security in 
both Central Asia and the wider world.
  U.S. companies remain the largest source of foreign direct investment 
in Kazakhstan, helping build resilient supply chains driving 
Kazakhstan&#x27;s economic diversification, supply chain resiliency, and 
sustainable economic development. Last month, Wabtec Corporation and 
Kazakhstan Temir Zholy announced a $4.2 billion locomotive deal, 
reflecting deepening cooperation between Kazakhstan and American firms.
  We reiterate our commitment to advancing repeal of the outdated 
Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which will allow us to fully realize the 
potential of this relationship. We also applaud Kazakhstan&#x27;s efforts to 
position itself as a key Eurasian transit hub. We believe it is in our 
shared interest to improve Central Asian connectivity with global 
markets to boost the resilience of supply chains, and will seek ways to 
support the realization of the Trans-Caspian ``Middle Corridor.&#x27;&#x27; In 
addition to continued dialogue to safeguard critical technologies and 
improve the investment climate, we hope that the ongoing process of 
constitutional and political reform in Kazakhstan initiated in 2022 
will strengthen governance and human rights.
  On the occasion of Kazakhstan&#x27;s Republic Day, we can reflect on our 
enduring friendship and the bright future of our strategic partnership. 
We look forward to continued high-level engagement with Kazakhstan, 
both bilaterally and in multilateral fora. In particular, we believe 
the anticipated [EA5] C5+1 Leaders&#x27; Summit in Washington, D.C. would be 
a pivotal opportunity to strengthen longstanding United States 
cooperation with Kazakhstan and Central Asia.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me and Representative Huizenga in honoring 
Kazakhstan&#x27;s Republic Day.

            RECOGNIZING 100 YEARS OF THE MANHEIM LIONS CLUB

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize 
the Manheim Lions Club for their 100th anniversary.
  Located in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the Manheim Lions Club is 
a dedicated community partner, exemplifying the Lions International 
motto of ``We Serve&#x27;&#x27; since their chartering in 1925. The club is 
heavily involved in youth activities, sponsoring a 14U baseball team 
and the Cub Scouts, and presenting educational awards to local 
students. It also runs programs that support vision care, such as an 
eyeglasses drive, and engages in a variety of community service and 
humanitarian relief efforts.
  These efforts are supported through Easter egg hunts, 5K races, broom 
sales, and food stands at the Manheim Farm Show. This does not include 
past traditions like car shows at the football field and plastic boat 
races on the creek. Ultimately, the money raised within the community 
is reinvested back into the community.
  The Manheim Lions are currently led by Club President Aaron 
Henderson. They are one of 49,000 Lions clubs across 200 countries and 
regions, and Lions Club International boasts 1.4 million members 
worldwide.
  As the Manheim Lions Club celebrates 100 years of community service, 
I would like to thank the club and its members for their long-standing 
record of selflessness. Their efforts have made Pennsylvania&#x27;s 11th 
Congressional District a better place, and I wish them another century 
of positive impact.

     RECOGNIZING THE JUNIOR LEAGUE OF ARLINGTON: EMPOWERING WOMEN, 
                        STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY

                                  _____
                                 

                          HON. MARC A. VEASEY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions and enduring legacy of the Junior League of Arlington 
(JLA), an organization that has been empowering women and strengthening 
the Arlington community for nearly five decades.
  Founded on October 22, 1975, as the Service League of Arlington with 
45 charter members, the organization was officially welcomed into the 
Association of Junior Leagues International on February 22, 1982, 
becoming the 248th Junior League and adopting the name Junior League of 
Arlington. Since that time, JLA has remained steadfast in its mission 
to advance women&#x27;s leadership for meaningful community impact through 
volunteer action, collaboration, and training.
  Over the years, the Junior League of Arlington has invested more than 
$3 million and over one million volunteer hours into more than 100 
local agencies. Through these efforts, the League has made a tangible 
difference in the lives of countless residents across North Texas. This 
year alone, JLA is providing $100,000 in grants to 10 community 
organizations, continuing its long tradition of philanthropy and 
partnership.
  Beyond its financial and volunteer contributions, the Junior League 
of Arlington&#x27;s influence is seen in its enduring commitment to service 
and empowerment. From its collaboration with Arlington ISD on the 
annual Back to School Kick-off at AT&amp;T Stadium, to its many ``Done in a 
Day&#x27;&#x27; projects, JLA consistently answers the call to serve families, 
women, and children in need.
  As the League begins a new chapter in its new home at Wellspring on 
Main--The Arlington Center for Community Engagement--it reaffirms its 
dedication to building stronger, more inclusive communities. Through 
leadership training, volunteerism, and a commitment to diversity, 
equity, and belonging, JLA continues to shape women into leaders who 
create lasting, positive change.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the Junior 
League of Arlington for its nearly 50 years of outstanding service, 
leadership, and community partnership. The League&#x27;s unwavering 
dedication to empowering women and strengthening the Arlington 
community stands as a model of civic engagement and compassion for us 
all.

       THANKING NOAH WOFSY FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
                            REPRESENTATIVES

                                  _____
                                 

                            HON. BRYAN STEIL

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 28, 2025

  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Ranking Member Morelle and 
myself, I kindly ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Noah Wofsy 
on his retirement as Deputy Legislative Counsel after 39 years of 
service to the House of Representatives. Noah joined the House Office 
of Legislative Counsel in 1986 after

[[Page E1014]]

earning his J.D. from the University of Southern California. I have had 
the good fortune of working with Noah in his capacity supporting the 
Committee on House Administration and the Subcommittee on Modernization 
and Innovation.
  Noah has served as the Deputy House Legislative Counsel since 2018, 
helping lead the office and manage a committed team of experts to 
provide the House with impartial and confidential drafting and 
counseling services for bills, amendments, resolutions, and laws.
  Throughout his career in the House of Representatives, Noah has lent 
his unmatched expertise to countless Members, committees, and staff 
working on a broad array of policy issues. The Select Committee on the 
Modernization of Congress relied heavily on Noah&#x27;s institutional 
knowledge and ideas when making recommendations to modernize the 
House&#x27;s outdated processes and technologies for legislative drafting. 
He was also instrumental in leading the effort last Congress to 
modernize leadership roles and succession planning in the Office of the 
Legislative Counsel. While Noah&#x27;s service over the years has benefited 
the House in many ways, his dedication to teaching staff the art of 
legislative drafting has left an indelible and lasting mark on this 
institution. Teaching is a talent that Noah exemplifies as thousands of 
current and former House staffers will attest.
  While Noah has been recognized by friends and colleagues for his 
steadfast commitment to public service and his expertise in the 
legislative drafting process, it is his unparalleled sense of humor 
that truly sets him apart. Over the course of his nearly four decades 
of service, the House saw a lot of change. Noah&#x27;s ability to constantly 
adapt and consistently excel--all while maintaining his sense of 
humor--is a bold testament to his dedication to the House of 
Representatives and the people it serves. I wish Noah the best for his 
well-earned retirement.
  On behalf of my colleagues and the entire House community, I thank 
him for his leadership and longstanding commitment to serving the 
People&#x27;s House.
