               HONORING ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. NORMA J. TORRES

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to our Nation&#x27;s Capital, and to honor 
him for his contributions to the Greek Orthodox community in the Inland 
Empire and beyond.
  In 1940, All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was born on an 
island called Imvros, which is located in modern-day Turkey. He 
completed his elementary and secondary education in both Imvros and 
Istanbul. For his undergraduate degree, he attended the historic 
Theological School of Halki, and for his graduate studies, he attended 
the Pontifical Oriental Institute of the Gregorian University in Rome, 
the Ecumenical Institute in Bossey, and the University of Munich. He 
completed his doctoral dissertation on the topic of Canon Law.
  In 1961, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was ordained to the 
Diaconate, and in 1969, he was ordained to the Priesthood. During this 
time, he served as the Assistant Dean for the Theological School of 
Halki, then as the Personal Secretary for the late Ecumenical Patriarch 
Demetrios, before being elected as Metropolitan of Philadelphia and 
subsequently Metropolitan of Chalcedon.
  The Ecumenical Patriarch was elected in October 1991 as the 270th 
Archbishop of the 2000-year-old Orthodox Church. His office is a 
historic title dating to the sixth century--Archbishop of 
Constantinople-New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch. At 85 years old, he 
is the longest-serving Archbishop of Constantinople and leads more than 
300 million congregation members nationwide. I am proud that one of 
those congregations, Saint Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church, is part of 
my congressional district in Upland, California.
  The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has used his influence to travel 
to every continent, where he has taken an active role in the World 
Council of Churches, addressed both the European Parliament and U.S. 
Congress, met with heads of state, and visited Orthodox churches in 
various countries. He has advanced diplomatic relations between 
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism internationally by co-sponsoring 
international peace conferences centered on racism and extremism. He 
has also supported traditionally Orthodox countries emerging from 
decades of wide-scale religious persecution, facilitated conversations 
with Muslim and Jewish leaders to promote mutual respect and religious 
tolerance, and has traveled to Muslim countries rarely visited by 
Christian leaders.
  The Ecumenical Patriarch is a champion for environmental advocacy, 
introducing environmental issues in his sermons, which has earned him 
the nickname the ``Green Patriarch.&#x27;&#x27; He has used his impact to found 
several major conventions, including a global bishop assembly that has 
met regularly since 1992, the inaugural Synaxis (assembly) of Orthodox 
Primates, the Clergy-Laity Congress, and the World Youth Conference of 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
  The Ecumenical Patriarch has received many awards, including the 
Congressional Gold Medal of the United States Congress in 1997, and has 
numerous honorary doctorates from institutions worldwide, including 
Georgetown University, Yale University, and several other international 
institutions.
  I warmly welcome Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew as he visits 
Washington, D.C., following his acceptance of the Templeton Prize--
honoring those who have made significant contributions in the fields of 
Religion and Science. His service to our community and beyond is worthy 
of the highest recognition.

                          ____________________

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Hallie Coyne 
and her service and contributions to Virginia&#x27;s 1st District and the 
Nation.
  Hallie joined my office in 2022 and quickly became one of the most 
effective and recognized personal office defense staffers in the House. 
As my National Security Advisor, Hallie has spearheaded numerous 
legislative efforts that delivered tangible results to the constituents 
of my district, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the country. Among 
her many accomplishments, Hallie spearheaded efforts to bolster the 
shipbuilding ecosystem in Virginia, strengthen commercial space launch 
infrastructure, bridge the gap between new defense start-ups and the 
Pentagon, and was a champion of defense technology and innovation.
  Hallie has served as a mentor and leader for my legislative staff and 
the entire office, sharing her expertise and experience with the rest 
of my team. Her counsel and guidance have shaped my staff into the most 
effective and successful team on Capitol Hill.
  I would like to thank Hallie for her many contributions and dedicated 
service over the last three and a half years. She is thorough, a true 
team player, and a spark in my office that will be dearly missed. 
Hallie has been an invaluable member of my team, and I wish her the 
best of luck as she moves on to the next chapter of her professional 
career.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank you in joining me to recognize Hallie Coyne for 
her service to Virginia&#x27;s 1st District and the Nation.

 HONORING JOSEFINA LOPEZ ON THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF CASA 0101 IN BOYLE 
                                HEIGHTS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JIMMY GOMEZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Josefina Lopez, a 
playwright, artistic director, and community leader.
  The daughter of a bracero, Josefina Lopez immigrated to the United 
States from Mexico at the age of 5. Her family settled in Boyle 
Heights, where Lopez grew up as an undocumented individual for 13 years 
until she was granted amnesty. Lopez&#x27;s experience as a Mexican, 
undocumented woman is what inspired her to write her acclaimed play 
Real Women Have Curves.
  The play, which was later adapted into a film, is based on Lopez&#x27;s 
lived experience juggling her family&#x27;s expectations to work at their 
sewing factory, her dream of pursuing an education in New York, and the 
ever-present fear of immigration authorities entering their 
communities. Along with her other works, Lopez has had over 100 
productions of her plays performed in the United States.
  At the start of her writing career, Lopez was often the sole woman of 
color in the room, inspiring her to create a path for Latinos like 
herself to achieve success in the arts. In 2000, Lopez founded CASA 
0101 to, make this dream a reality by bringing theater and arts 
programs to the community she grew up in. For the last 25 years, the 
organization has produced hundreds of plays, provided free arts classes 
for young Angelenos, and supported the next generation of storytellers 
and artists. The impact of Lopez&#x27;s work can be felt from Boyle Heights 
to Broadway.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Josefina 
Lopez.

  Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Ms. Cynthia Lee 
for her remarkable 44 years of federal service with the Department of 
the Army.
  Ms. Lee began her journey at Virginia State University where she 
earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. She then went 
on to pursue a Master of Science in Contract and Acquisition Management 
from the Florida Institute of Technology, laying the academic 
foundation for a career that would span more than 4 decades.
  At the age of 18, Ms. Lee began her career as a student hire. From 
those early days, she demonstrated exceptional leadership, rising 
through the ranks to become a well-respected leader.
  Over the course of her career, Ms. Lee&#x27;s contributions have left a 
lasting impact on both her peers and the entire federal workforce in 
her role as Program Manager of Small Business Programs within the 
Department of the Army.
  In recognition for her exceptional performance, Ms. Lee has received 
numerous awards that reflect her commitment and dedication. As Resource 
Management Chief, she was commended for her service as Acting Deputy 
Commander from May 2021 to January 2022, a role in which she displayed 
exceptional professionalism.
  I want to personally thank Ms. Lee for her decades of service. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Lee for her 44 
years of outstanding federal service. We are deeply grateful for her 
dedication, her leadership, and her invaluable contributions to our 
Nation.

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, in recognition of Suicide Prevention Month, I 
rise to honor Stable Recovery for their work around mental health, 
suicide, and addiction. Stable Recovery is a small, peer-driven, 
equine-focused rehabilitation program located in Kentucky. This program 
was launched on Taylor Made Farm in 2022 by co-founders Frank Taylor 
and Christian Countzler. Their vision was simple but powerful: to help 
individuals find strength and healing through the power of the horse, 
the principles of 12-step recovery, and the dignity of meaningful work.
  The School of Horsemanship, created by Frank Taylor and built on 
decades of horsemanship knowledge, provides a 90-day residential 
program for education and healing. Residents find structure, 
discipline, and purpose as they learn equine care, farm work, financial 
independence and participate in daily therapy, support groups, and 12-
step instruction. The goal was to not only allow residents to thrive 
and learn in recovery but to provide a natural employment pathway to 
jobs in the equine industry, an industry that needs more skilled 
talent.
  The horse industry has been extraordinarily supportive. In just three 
short years, Stable Recovery has already seen lives transformed and 
exceptional growth. They credit their success to evidence based 
clinical practices, consistency of the program, mentorship, community 
and the healing power of horses. The men and women that have completed 
the program have reached milestones of sobriety. Many now live in 
recovery while working in the

[[Page E865]]

equine industry. Stable Recovery&#x27;s metrics exceed national norms. As of 
today, 80 percent of Stable Recovery&#x27;s legacy graduates remain sober 
and are employed in the equine industry. Generous individuals and 
organizations, like HISA and Jockeys&#x27; Guild, believe in their mission. 
Their support has given residents a chance to recover at Taylor Made 
Farm and strategic partners have provided stable employment, allowing 
graduates to build lives of independence and purpose.
  I am honored to recognize the work of Stable Recovery as we consider 
their incredible work for our community and what more can be done to 
prevent suicide in our Nation. We can heal people through horses, and 
in the process, create better lives, stronger families, and the 
opportunity of a bright future.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE BILLIONAIRE INCOME TAX ACT AND NOTING THE POPE&#x27;S

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I plan to introduce the Billionaire Income 
Tax Act on Wednesday and will hold a press conference with the House 
cosponsor Congressman Don Beyer and the Senate bill sponsor Ron Wyden.
  It is an effort to establish a level of fairness in federal income 
taxation and prevent millionaires and billionaires, and the aspiring 
trillionaire, Elon Musk, from taking advantage of the tax code to pay 
what, for them is pocket change. I have not asked him, but it looks 
like Pope Leo would endorse the Billionaire Income Tax Act. He recently 
did an interview with a biographer and excerpts were released on 
Sunday. Speaking of societal polarization, he said it is in part caused 
by income inequality. One factor, he said, and I&#x27;m quoting him, is 
``the continuously wider gap between the income levels of the working 
class and the money that the wealthiest receive. For example, CEOs that 
60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what 
the workers are receiving, the last figure I saw, it&#x27;s 600 times more 
than what average workers are receiving. Yesterday the said news that 
Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does 
that mean and what&#x27;s that about? If that is the only thing that has 
value anymore, then we&#x27;re in big trouble.&#x27;&#x27; I agree with Pope Leo and 
hope our bill will have a significant effect on what everyone seems to 
acknowledge is a huge and growing problem.

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of His All-Holiness 
Bartholomew, Archbishop of Constantinople and Ecumenical Patriarch, as 
he visits the United States to receive the Templeton Prize.
  Born Demetrios Arhondonis on the island of Imvros, known today as 
Gokceada, Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew was elected the 270th 
Archbishop of Constantinople and Ecumenical Patriarch in October 1991. 
Today he leads a community of 300 million Orthodox Christians and is 
the longest serving archbishop in the church&#x27;s 2,000-year history. 
Patriarch Bartholomew pursued theological studies in Istanbul, Rome, 
Switzerland, Germany, and Greece, earning a doctorate in Canon law. 
Recognized for his scholarship and global perspective, he has received 
honorary doctorates from leading institutions across the world.
  Throughout his time as Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew has worked 
to build unity among the Christian churches and foster meaningful 
dialogue between world religions. He has convened many international 
conferences, bringing together religious leaders from across the globe 
to promote coexistence and tolerance. Known as the ``Green Patriarch,&#x27;&#x27; 
Patriarch Bartholomew has brought significant attention to ecological 
concerns, organizing global, interfaith symposia on climate change and 
ecological responsibility. For his environmental leadership, he has 
received numerous awards and international recognition.
  Patriarch Bartholomew has addressed the United Nations, the European 
Parliament, and the World Economic Forum, earning accolades from around 
the world. In recognition of his global contributions, he received the 
Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. In September 2025, Patriarch 
Bartholomew will travel to the U.S. to receive the Templeton Prize, one 
the most prestigious awards recognizing those who use the power of 
science to explore the deepest questions of the universe and 
humankind&#x27;s place and purpose within it. Previous recipients include 
St. Teresa of Kolkata and the Dalai Lama.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate the work of His All-Holiness 
Bartholomew, Archbishop of Constantinople and Ecumenical Patriarch, and 
I ask that my colleagues join me in welcoming him to Washington, D.C. 
and thanking him for his ongoing commitment to advancing peace and 
religious freedom.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Tess 
Kuenning, president and CEO of Bi-State Primary Care Association. Her 
community-based approach to public health and exceptional leadership 
have significantly improved both the quality and accessibility of 
health care in New Hampshire, Vermont, and the rest of the country.
  Tess has dedicated her entire career to improving public health. 
After earning her Master&#x27;s in Nursing and Public/Community Health in 
1990, she worked in Nepal as a Peace Corps nurse for five years. There, 
Tess taught women to be birth attendants and designed sustainable 
maternal and child health programs. While Tess loved working one-on-one 
with patients and clinicians, she wanted to expand her impact to the 
community level, pushing her to transition to public health. After 
returning to the United States, she worked for the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services as the principal public health advisor 
throughout New England and as a nurse consultant for the Health Care 
Finance Administration.
  For the past thirty years, Tess has led Bi-State Primary Case 
Association, which advocates for Community Health Centers in New 
Hampshire and Vermont. Community Health Centers play a crucial role in 
delivering primary care, especially in areas where medical services are 
limited or unaffordable. Offering accessible, preventive, and routine 
care, they serve as a vital lifeline for low and moderate-income 
families who might otherwise go without essential health services. As 
president and CEO of Bi-State PCA, Tess has been instrumental in 
leveraging her clinical background, experience in public health, and 
many connections to stakeholders, nonprofits, and Congressional Offices 
like my own to uplift community health centers in our state. Under her 
leadership, Bi-State has grown from a staff of 6 to over 20 and now 
serves over 312,000 patients across New Hampshire and Vermont.
  I have had the pleasure of meeting with Tess multiple times over the 
past few years, and I am always inspired by her determination, 
creativity, positivity, and genuine passion for community health. I am 
so grateful to Tess for sharing her experience and knowledge with me 
and other Members of Congress, helping us improve our healthcare 
system. Tess is a true leader and public servant, and I want to 
acknowledge the profound positive impact she has had on community 
health in her community.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st Congressional 
District, I thank Tess Kuenning for her selflessness and dedication to 
the patients she serves. Her dedication to advocating for community 
health centers has improved healthcare in our state and has made her 
community a better place. Tess&#x27;s work has brought us one step closer to 
ensuring that health care is a right, not a privilege, for all. I wish 
her all the best in the years to come.

           RECOGNIZING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF DIXIE DEMUTH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MORGAN McGARVEY

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the 
legacy and remarkable life of a Louisville hometown hero, Dixie Demuth, 
who fought for equality for women in Kentucky and left a permanent mark 
on our city and commonwealth.
  Born in 1917 in the famous Samuels House in Samuels, Kentucky, Dixie 
moved to Louisville with her mother in 1933 at the height of the Great 
Depression. From an early age, she worked in restaurants and bars, 
learning the trade in popular downtown spots until she opened her own 
place on 5th Street in Louisville. She called it Dixie&#x27;s Elbow Room. 
Although Dixie was allowed to own and run a bar, a two-hundred-year-old 
Kentucky law prohibited women from working as bartenders or even 
sitting at bars. Dixie decided that just

[[Page E863]]

wasn&#x27;t right, and, in 1968, she hired her very first woman bartender 
and served a woman seated at her bar--her own adult daughter, in fact.
  The Kentucky Alcohol Beverage Control Board came down hard and fast, 
incensed not only that she was breaking the law but also that she 
openly advertised her rulebreaking in the hope that other bar owners 
would join her fight, but no one did. Though the ABC shut her down and 
took her liquor license, Dixie did not give up the fight. Found guilty 
of violating the antiquated state law, Dixie appealed her sentence and 
brought her case to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, who decided in her 
favor in 1972, calling the law ``invidious and arbitrary.&#x27;&#x27; Her quiet 
revolution behind the counter became a landmark victory for women&#x27;s 
rights in the commonwealth and across the country.
  At 100 years old, when asked why she decided to take her bold stand, 
Dixie remembered: ``I said this is ridiculous, I&#x27;m going to change 
that, so I did.&#x27;&#x27; Dixie died in 2020 at the age of 102, but her legacy 
lives on. In 2023, she was inducted into the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of 
Fame, which recognizes sacrifice and determination in the bourbon 
industry. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg recently unveiled a new 
historical marker, part of the Louisville Metro Historical Marker 
Program, placed where her bar once stood, ensuring that future 
generations will learn about Dixie&#x27;s fight and victory.
  As a co-chair of the Congressional Bourbon Caucus, and as a proud son 
of Louisville, I am grateful for the path Dixie paved for the bourbon 
industry and the many women who work in it. Mr. Speaker, I ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life and legacy of 
Dixie Demuth, as well as to celebrate the unveiling of the historical 
marker that enshrines her in our city&#x27;s history.

                          ____________________

  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mrs. Kathy Chester 
Luke of Philadelphia, Mississippi. Mrs. Luke spent most of her life 
living in Philadelphia with her husband, Bob Luke, and always 
considered it home. Kathy was a devoted teacher who poured patience, 
encouragement, and a belief that the children she encountered would 
help shape a better future for their families and communities into 
every student who entered the doors of her classroom. The love Kathy 
showed to her students was a small glimpse into the selfless matriarch 
her family remembers her to be. Nothing brought Kathy more joy than 
seeing all her family gathered in one room. She loved to decorate for 
the holidays, travel with her husband, and play mahjong weekly with her 
friends.
  Kathy&#x27;s time as an educator impacted countless lives as she served as 
a selfless pillar of strength to her students and coworkers. Her life 
and legacy are forever marked with generosity, wisdom, and a deep love 
for others. I am honored to remember her legacy here today.

                           HON. SUMMER L. LEE

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Ms. LEE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His 
All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, Archbishop of 
Constantinople-New Rome and spiritual leader of more than 300 million 
Orthodox Christians worldwide, to Washington, D.C.
  This week, His All-Holiness is visiting our Nation&#x27;s Capital to 
receive the Templeton Prize, the most prestigious international award 
in religion and science. With this honor, he joins the ranks of Mother 
Teresa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and the Dalai Lama. The recognition 
reflects not only his scholarship and spiritual leadership but his 
unwavering witness for peace, human dignity, and care for creation.
  For more than three decades as Ecumenical Patriarch, His All-Holiness 
has been a global voice for reconciliation among peoples of different 
faiths and traditions. He has also been one of the first religious 
leaders to insist that harming the environment is not simply a failure 
of policy but a moral failing. His leadership reminds us that 
stewardship of our planet is inseparable from justice for our 
communities.
  His leadership has been honored across the world. In 1997, he 
received the Congressional Gold Medal here in the United States, and he 
has been recognized internationally as one of the most influential 
figures of our time. Yet the true measure of his ministry lies not in 
awards, but in his call for peace over division, compassion over 
violence, and responsibility over indifference. As he has said, ``We 
have it in our power either to increase the hurt inflicted on our world 
or to contribute toward its healing. The choice is ours.&#x27;&#x27;
  His life&#x27;s work reminds us that building a better world depends on 
moral courage, the same courage we need to meet our own fights for 
justice at home.
  The people of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 12th District, including the faithful of 
the Presentation of Christ Greek Orthodox Church in East Pittsburgh and 
St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Pittsburgh, are proud to share 
in this welcome.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary 
ministry of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew and in congratulating him 
on this well-deserved honor.

  WELCOMING ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE, HIS ALL-HOLINESS 
             BARTHOLOMEW&#x27;S 2025 VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DARRELL ISSA

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to the 
Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew, 
the spiritual leader and ``First Among Equals&#x27;&#x27; of more than 300 
million Orthodox Christians worldwide. During this historic visit to 
the United States, His All-Holiness will receive the Templeton Prize--
the world&#x27;s most prestigious award in Religion and Science.
  Patriarch Bartholomew&#x27;s efforts to promote religious freedom and 
human rights and his initiatives to advance religious tolerance among 
the world&#x27;s religions, together with his work toward international 
peace and environmental protection, have justly placed him at the 
forefront of global visionaries as an apostle of love, peace, and 
reconciliation.
  We are privileged to host the longest-serving Archbishop of 
Constantinople in history here in our Nation&#x27;s Capital, as he meets 
with the President, Secretary of State, and Congress. His visit to the 
United States serves as a testament to his unwavering commitment to 
fostering mutual respect and religious tolerance on a global level.
  I look forward to the opportunity to welcome His All-Holiness and 
express our collective gratitude for his continued leadership and 
dedication to the cause of peace and religious liberty. In the words of 
His All-Holiness: ``If our age will be remembered, it may be for those 
who dedicated themselves to the cause of peace.&#x27;&#x27;

      WELCOMING HIS ALL-HOLINESS, ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it is an extraordinary honor to 
welcome His All-Holiness, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, to 
Washington, D.C. We are grateful to receive not only the spiritual 
leader of more than 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, but also 
a man whose life and ministry have embodied courage, compassion, and an 
unshakable commitment to peace and human dignity.
  He was born Demetrios Arhondonis in 1940 on the island of Imvros in 
Turkey--most inhabitants of Imvros were Greek until the 1960&#x27;s, when 
the Turkish government forced them to emigrate. In 1970, the Turkish 
government officially renamed Imvros to Gokceada. Thus, Patriarch 
Bartholomew&#x27;s journey has been marked from its earliest days by faith 
and perseverance in the face of religious persecution and nationalistic 
intolerance. Educated at the Theological School of Halki and later in 
Rome, Munich, and Switzerland, he distinguished himself in the fields 
of theology and canon law, becoming a respected scholar even before his 
ordination. In October 1991, he was elected the 270th Archbishop of 
Constantinople-New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch, assuming the role of 
``first among equals&#x27;&#x27; in the ancient Patriarchate founded by the 
Apostle Andrew.
  Since that time, His All-Holiness has been ca]Ied many things: the 
``Patriarch of Peace,&#x27;&#x27; the ``Green Patriarch,&#x27;&#x27; and, above all, a 
bridge builder. For more than three decades, he has labored under 
extraordinary difficulties. In a region where the Orthodox community 
has suffered harassment and intimidation by Islamic extremists, he has 
stood steadfast, not only defending the faithful, but offering 
reconciliation to their adversaries. He has endured hostility, threats, 
and attempts to silence his office, yet his response has always been 
guided by the Christian virtues of forgiveness, humility, and love.
  His All-Holiness has taken that witness far beyond the walls of the 
Patriarchate in Constantinople. He has convened dialogues among 
Christians, Muslims, and Jews, creating unprecedented opportunities for 
mutual understanding in the Middle East, one of the world&#x27;s most 
divided regions, and beyond. From Libya to Syria, from Egypt to 
Azerbaijan, he has sought not confrontation, but instead ``a dialogue 
of loving truth.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Speaker, His All-Holiness is not only a voice of principle, but a 
leader of action. He presided over the historic Holy and Great Council 
of the Orthodox Church in Crete in 2016, granted autocephaly to the 
Church of Ukraine in 2019, and continues to strengthen unity within the 
Orthodox world while opening channels of dialogue with the Catholic 
Church and other Christian traditions. His leadership is defined not by 
power or coercion, but by example--the examples of service, sacrifice, 
and fidelity to Christ&#x27;s command to love our neighbor as ourselves.
  As we welcome him, we are mindful that the challenges he faces are 
immense. Religious freedom is often denied to Orthodox Christians--and 
under constraint in many of the lands they have inhabited for 
centuries. Christians and other minorities in many regions still face 
persecution.
  I thank His All-Holiness for his witness, courage, and example. 
Washington welcomes him, not only as a guest, but as a brother, a 
teacher, and a peacemaker. May his visit strengthen the bonds between 
our peoples, and may his ministry continue to inspire us all to walk 
humbly, act justly, and love mercifully in the service of God and one 
another.
