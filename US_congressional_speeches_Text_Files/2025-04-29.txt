      CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF THE RAILROAD MUSEUM OF PENNSYLVANIA

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2025

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize 
the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania for their 50th anniversary.
  Originally created by an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, 
the Railroad Museum opened its doors 50 years ago in April 1975. The 
first structure in North America specifically built as a railroad 
museum, the Railroad Museum has since added building restorations, an 
education center, a museum store, and many new exhibits. The museum is 
affiliated with the Smithsonian and the Pennsylvania Historical &amp; 
Museum Commission, and has received generous community support from an 
aptly named nonprofit, the Friends of the Railroad Museum of 
Pennsylvania.

[[Page E361]]

  Today, the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania&#x27;s world-class collection 
includes over 100 historic locomotives and railroad cars, a vast 
library with half a million photographs and documents, a working 
restoration shop, and 20,000 smaller items relating to Pennsylvania 
railroads.
  As the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania celebrates their golden 
anniversary year, I would like to thank the museum for the educational 
opportunities they provide and for their work in keeping not just our 
community&#x27;s history, but Pennsylvania&#x27;s history, alive.

                          ____________________

COMMEMORATING COACH GREG HEIAR AND THE TRINITY VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
 MEN&#x27;S BASKETBALL TEAM ON THEIR HISTORIC NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2025

  Mr. GOODEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible 
accomplishment of the Trinity Valley Community College Men&#x27;s Basketball 
Team, who, under the leadership of Coach Greg Heiar, secured their 
first-ever national championship in 2025.
  In his first season as head coach, Coach Heiar led the Cardinals to a 
69-61 victory over Connors State in the NJCAA D1 Men&#x27;s Basketball 
National Championship in Hutchinson, Kansas. This victory concluded a 
dominant 34-3 season, marking the best in the program&#x27;s history.
  The Cardinals showed remarkable resilience, determination, and unity 
throughout the season. They embraced the tough, defense-first mentality 
instilled by their coach, and each player&#x27;s commitment to the team&#x27;s 
success played a critical role in bringing home this historic title.
  I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Coach Heiar, his coaching 
staff, and the entire men&#x27;s basketball team. Their hard work, 
dedication, and pride in their community have made this championship a 
lasting symbol of excellence for the Trinity Valley community.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2025

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jessica Arocho, an 
exceptional individual who has devoted her life to serving the North 
Brooklyn community. As the Director of Community Affairs at NYC Health 
+ Hospitals/Woodhull, Jessica exemplifies the spirit of service that 
defines our community leaders.
  Jessica is a true product of Williamsburg, following in the footsteps 
of her strong Puerto Rican mother, Dona Carmen Gines, and other 
influential community leaders. Her lifelong commitment to service began 
in her childhood, when she frequently accompanied her mother to 
Woodhull Hospital, their trusted medical home. It is also where her 
youngest daughter was born, and where Jessica began her career in the 
Youth Outreach program.
  Since taking on the role as Director of Community Affairs in January 
2020, Jessica has been instrumental in enhancing the hospital&#x27;s 
outreach and building partnerships with local organizations. She 
advocates for good health and promotes positive energy within the 
community, ensuring that residents have access to essential health 
resources. Her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly 
noteworthy; she ensured that hospital staff received essential 
supplies, including meals and personal protective equipment. 
Additionally, she organized successful initiatives that provided 
thousands of coats, toys, backpacks, and school supplies to families in 
need.
  Jessica&#x27;s dedication extends beyond her professional 
responsibilities. She has served on the Community Advisory Board (CAB) 
for 16 years, including five years as Chair, and held the position of 
Vice Chair of the NYC Health + Hospitals Council of CABs. She has also 
been an integral part of Woodhull&#x27;s leadership team, advocating for the 
hospital&#x27;s funding and operational needs.
  Her commitment to the community has been recognized, as she was named 
to Crain&#x27;s ``2021 Notable Hispanic Leaders and Executives&#x27;&#x27; list, 
highlighting her role as a strong advocate for NYC Health + Hospitals/
Woodhull. Her relentless efforts and steadfast dedication to the 
Williamsburg and Bushwick communities serve as an inspiration for 
future generations of leaders.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Jessica 
Arocho for her exceptional contributions to our community. Her 
dedication, leadership, and service are truly commendable, and she 
represents the very best of Brooklyn.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE QUIGLEY

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2025

  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and 
legacy of David John Meyer, Chicago Fire Department Captain.
  In 1996, David joined the Chicago Fire Department and committed 
nearly three decades of his life to serving the city of Chicago. Before 
David rose through the ranks and became Captain of Truck 29, he was a 
Lieutenant on Truck 35, where he was not only known for his fearless 
leadership style, but also for his strong commitment to the Chicago 
Fire Department, the community he served, and his fellow firefighters. 
Chicago&#x27;s firefighters put their lives on the line for us every single 
day and David spent his entire career protecting our property, 
communities, people, and city. He was described as a hero by his 
colleagues. I can only echo their sentiments and say that Chicago has 
lost one of our finest public servants. He leaves an unforgettable mark 
on the city of Chicago.
  The passion David brought to his work protecting our city was also 
displayed in several other aspects of his life--whether it was through 
entertaining his family and friends, the jokes that kept his friends 
and family laughing, or riding his Harley around the country. David 
also displayed his dedication as an avid carpenter and the proprietor 
of Meyer Builders, a family business. His remarkable carpentry was even 
featured on HGTV&#x27;s Windy City Rehab.
  David was a proud Chicagoan who loved cheering for hometown sports, 
including the Cubs, Bears, and Blackhawks. Most importantly, he was a 
family man. He met his wife of 30 years, Kristen, at Lane Tech College 
Prep High School at the age of 16. He is survived by his wife, three 
daughters, a son, and his parents.
  The city of Chicago and the Chicago Fire Department have lost a true 
hero that will be dearly missed. His legacy will be remembered by his 
family, friends, loved ones, colleagues, and the many lives he touched. 
I am forever grateful to David for the work that he did to protect our 
city and could not be prouder to have him as my constituent.

personality, and her charitable heart will live on in our memories

                 IN REMEMBRANCE OF GERALD P. McDERMOTT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DIANA DeGETTE

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2025

  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of my dear friend and mentor, Gerald P. McDermott--a highly regarded 
trial attorney, advocate for justice, pillar of Denver&#x27;s legal 
community, and revered family man.
  Jerry&#x27;s career was defined by an unwavering commitment to defending 
the rights of all Coloradoans, no matter their circumstance or 
situation.
  Jerry was a proud son of Pueblo, Colorado. He stayed in Colorado for 
his education, attending Colorado State University and the University 
of Denver School of Law, where he was a member of the law review.
  After graduating from law school, Jerry established a legal career 
fighting for people who needed a strong advocate. He was associated 
with many preeminent trial firms in Colorado and founded his own firm, 
establishing the highest standards of trial excellence and ethics.
  Jerry&#x27;s lifelong love of politics was cemented when he was a reading 
clerk for the Colorado State Legislature during the 1965-66 session. 
Later, he was the point person for the rights of the injured in the 
1985 tort reform legislative session and gained respect from 
legislators on both sides of the aisle. He consistently supported 
politicians who he believed met his standards and worked actively to 
help them get elected and succeed in office.
  I saw this for myself. When I was a young member of the General 
Assembly, struggling to balance my law practice, service as a 
legislator, and raising two young daughters, Jerry took me in. He gave 
me an office in his firm and was always there to help me with a case or 
give advice about a tricky legal issue.
  Jerry received many awards and accolades, but he would say that his 
biggest success was his family. He and Rosemarie were married for over 
60 years, and they raised two sons, Sean and Brian. Over the years, 
Jerry spoke to me with such pride about the success of his boys. Truly, 
his family was the center of his life.
  To scores of Colorado lawyers, Jerry was a guiding light and voice of 
reason. He gave us advice, set an example through his work, and showed 
us what it meant to fight for people who needed a strong advocate.
  His dedication to fairness and justice had a lasting impact on 
generations of trial lawyers. I am proud to have known Jerry and to 
call him my friend.
  Colorado&#x27;s legal community mourns the loss of a giant.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2025

  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to include in the Record 
the following Proclamation in recognition of this and every April 29th 
as #EndJewHatred Day.

       Whereas, for centuries, the Jewish people have sustained 
     their shared religious, cultural, and ethnic identity and 
     traditions in the face of enslavement, persecution, genocide, 
     segregation and discrimination, and all manner of adversity; 
     and
       Whereas, since the first Jewish person set foot in America 
     in 1654, members of the Jewish community have made indelible 
     contributions to the state of Florida and to the United 
     States of America, contributing to the vibrant cultural, 
     historical, and social framework of American life; and
       Whereas, the greatness in American democracy and the 
     promise of liberty and opportunity have drawn countless 
     Jewish individuals to these shores, including those escaping 
     from oppressive regimes in Europe, survivors of the 
     Holocaust, and those seeking a haven from persecution; and
       Whereas, the Jewish community has been instrumental in 
     advancing civil rights initiatives across America, fighting 
     discrimination, and advocating for justice and inclusivity 
     for all members of society; and
       Whereas, despite notable progress toward social justice, 
     the Jewish community continues to face antisemitism and Jew-
     hatred; and
       Whereas, the reality of antisemitism has manifested itself 
     in various forms, from microaggressions to violent attacks, 
     targeting Jewish individuals for their identity and seeking 
     to deny their shared identity; and
       Whereas, the alarming increase in hate crimes against the 
     Jewish community has catalyzed movements such as End Jew 
     Hatred, which seeks to reshape public dialogue and create a 
     society where Jew-hatred is intolerable, empowering 
     individuals to embrace their Jewish heritage without fear of 
     attack or persecution; and
       Whereas, we all have a moral obligation to confront and 
     reject Jew-hatred in all its forms; and
       Whereas, the first official recognition of ``#EndJewHatred 
     Day&#x27;&#x27; on April 29, 2022, exemplified a united stand against 
     Jew-hatred, empowering collective action towards a future 
     characterized by fighting racism and bigotry with 
     understanding and equality; and
       Whereas, it is imperative that we remain vigilant and 
     proactive in opposing Jew-hatred to ensure that the painful 
     history of the past is not forgotten or repeated;
       Now, therefore, be it proclaimed, That I, Representative 
     Frederica Wilson, in recognition of the urgent need to end 
     Jew-hatred in this generation, hereby declare and proclaim 
     every April 29 as ``#EndJewHatred Day;&#x27;&#x27; and
       Be it further proclaimed, That I, Representative Frederica 
     Wilson, affirm and proclaim that the 24th Congressional 
     District of Florida stands united in condemning Jew-hatred in 
     all its forms and remains steadfast in the commitment to end 
     discrimination against, and persecution of, the Jewish 
     community.

                                 ______

                        Tuesday, April 29, 2025

  Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
very brave young woman from Virginia&#x27;s Second District. Vada Carawan is 
an 11-year-old Virginia Beach native who recently showed courage beyond 
her years when she saved her father&#x27;s life. On November 23, 2024, Vada 
was spending time with her father, Clinton, when he started to 
experience what doctors later called ``sudden cardiac death,&#x27;&#x27; which 
comes with no warning. Just 11 days earlier, Clinton had driven Vada to 
girl scouts where she learned how to perform CPR. The moment Clinton 
started to experience the cardiac event, Vada told herself that she 
could cry once the EMT came, but before that she had to focus on saving 
her dad&#x27;s life. Vada thinks she performed CPR for around 5 to 7 
minutes, which doctors said was critical to saving her dad&#x27;s life. For 
her heroism, Vada received the National Medal of Honor--Lifesaving 
Award from the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Her bravery 
and quick action in a time of distress is truly remarkable. Virginia&#x27;s 
Second District is truly lucky to have such a fearless and impressive 
member of the community and we are so thankful that her father is ok. 
Please join me in recognizing Vada for her heroism.
