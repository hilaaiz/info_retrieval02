                                THE YEAR

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize 
Ecore International for being named Exporter of the Year by the Export-
Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).
  Beginning as a small cork manufacturer in 1871, Lancaster-based Ecore 
International is a global leader in circular rubber flooring. Ecore has 
covered projects from local gyms, turf fields, and playgrounds to NFL 
locker rooms and Churchill Downs. What makes Ecore truly special is 
their dedication to sustainability and innovation. Ecore uses recycled 
rubber and ensures it can be reused continuously, transforming 430 
million pounds of rubber waste annually into 1,500 different products.
  Ecore International operates in 76 different countries and has 13 
facilities across the United States, including 2 in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 11th 
Congressional District. Their recognition as EXIM&#x27;s Exporter of the 
Year compliments their noteworthy pedigree of awards and 
accomplishments.
  It is with great pride that I can consider Ecore International among 
my constituents. I thank the company for helping to solidify 
Pennsylvania&#x27;s 11th Congressional District as a center for 
manufacturing and innovation, and once again I congratulate them for 
being EXIM&#x27;s Exporter of the Year.

                          ____________________

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Vietnam and Korean War 
veterans who traveled to Washington, D.C. on May 14, 2025, with Honor 
Flight Chicago, a program that provides WWII, Vietnam, and Korean War 
veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials on The National Mall 
in Washington, D.C. These memorials were built to honor their courage 
and service to their country.
  The American Veteran is one of our greatest treasures. The Soldiers, 
Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled here on May 
14 answered our Nation&#x27;s call to service during one of its greatest 
times of need. From the Pacific Asian Theatre to the Korean Theater, 
these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave service, and 
sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a hero. We owe 
them more gratitude than can ever be expressed.
  I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials. 
I am proud to include in the Record the names of these men and women 
for all to see, hear, and recognize, and I call on my colleagues to 
rise and join me in expressing gratitude.

    INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD 
                     INSPECTOR GENERAL ACT OF 2025

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Retirement 
Thrift Investment Board Inspector General Act of 2025, which would 
create an independent Inspector General (IG) for the Federal Retirement 
Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). The FRTIB administers the Thrift 
Savings Plan (TSP), the retirement savings and investment plan for 
federal employees.
  In 2022, the FRTIB launched a new recordkeeping system with the goal 
of modernizing TSP&#x27;s recordkeeping, improving customer service and 
bolstering cybersecurity. There were widespread problems with the new 
system, including account access, account balances, missing or 
incomplete information in accounts and hours-long wait times to reach 
customer service. I, along with several colleagues, asked the 
Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the implementation of 
the new system. GAO found that FRTIB ``did not fully implement key 
acquisition management practices . . . [which] significantly increased 
the risk of a problematic rollout of the new system.&#x27;&#x27;
  TSP has approximately 7.2 million participants and $937 billion in 
assets, making it the world&#x27;s largest defined contribution plan. 
Federal employees dedicate their careers to serving our country, and 
they deserve a retirement savings and investment plan that provides 
top-tier customer support and security.
  While the Employee Benefits Security Administration has oversight 
responsibility for TSP, as it does for private sector 401(k) plans, 
there is no IG for the FRTIB. The problems with the rollout of the 
recordkeeping system are evidence enough that the FRTIB needs an 
independent IG.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

                       RECOGNIZING DEAN LANCASTER

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Mr. Dean Lancaster has made as a volunteer with the 
Hernando County School System. Mr. Lancaster offered his services as an 
announcer for high school basketball games. Coach Kupcik decided to 
allow him to announce at an upcoming game and had no idea what to 
expect. When Mr. Lancaster arrived to announce his first game, he came 
early, brought all his fancy equipment, and got to work setting up. 
That night, he blew everyone away and bought a real, college-like feel 
to the game. He was prepared and professional, enthusiastic and 
exciting. He brought music, catchphrases, and announcing on the call--
the whole nine yards. All night long people were asking, ``where did 
this guy come from?&#x27;&#x27;, ``he is amazing!&#x27;&#x27;, ``Can he come to every 
game?&#x27;&#x27;. Coach Kupcik told him, ``You&#x27;re hired!&#x27;&#x27; That day, and every 
day moving forward, he refused payment for his services. Mr. Lancaster 
always says it&#x27;s his way of giving back to the community. Since his 
``tryout&#x27;&#x27;, Mr. Lancaster has offered his talents, professionalism, and 
enthusiasm to every home Boys Basketball game at Springstead High 
School. Over the years, he has agreed to do the same for every home 
Varsity Football and Baseball game as well. Because he has been so 
popular and because he brings so much to the events he is announcing, 
Mr. Lancaster has also been requested to announce at other big events 
at Springstead, such as senior nights, their annual cheer competition 
and during the final matches of the historic Corey Hill Memorial 
Wrestling Tournament. As an Athletic Director, Coach Kupcik shares that 
having a consistent announcer locked in is always a plus. It&#x27;s one less 
thing to worry about. But having a consistent, amazing, professional-
level announcer that transforms a relatively meaningless Tuesday night 
baseball or basketball game into a must-go-to, college like event for 
fans and players alike is truly a blessing. Mr. Lancaster is one of a 
kind, and is now a true part of what Springstead Athletics is, and 
forever an Eagle.
  It is clear Dean Lancaster has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to 
serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Ms. Kimberly Godding Brooks has made to our 
community through her volunteerism. Since 2008, 17 years, Kimberly 
Godding Brooks has volunteered her time and talents to support Friends 
of Citrus and the Nature Coast Grief Services for children. Kimberly 
started as a Volunteer Coordinator, for Camp Good/Teen Encounter, a 
grief support camp for kids and teens who have experienced a loss. 
Trained volunteers provide therapeutic activities, in a camp setting, 
and help children share their stories with peers, whereby strengthening 
their ability to cope. Kimberly was Branch Manager with a local bank 
which donated backpacks to all campers. When Kimberly married Robert 
Brooks, she quickly recruited him to become a Camp Volunteer. Kimberly 
and Robert use ``Lifelines&#x27;&#x27;, an exercise using strings and dark 
glasses, that block vision, to help children build self-confidence and 
``find their way&#x27;&#x27;. When Kimberly&#x27;s mom, Lynn Godding, moved to our 
area, Kimberly quickly recruited her as a volunteer for the camp 
``kitchen team.&#x27;&#x27; In 2018, Kimberly and Robert&#x27;s daughter Coral was 
born. She began attending volunteer events, meetings, workshops and 
camps with her parents. Coral became an official volunteer at age 6 and 
serves as a role model for other camp kids. She participates in local

                         RECOGNIZING KYLE SMITH

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Kyle Smith has made through his work with the Pasco 
County Human Services Team. The Pasco County Human Services Team has 
proven itself to be a cornerstone of resilience, innovation, and 
unwavering commitment to the community. Amidst the devastating impacts 
of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, they emerged as an indispensable 
force, transforming challenges into triumphs and ensuring no resident 
was left behind. The team managed and helped coordinate efforts for 
shelters that housed 485 residents. When Hurricane Milton struck 
shortly thereafter, the team rose to even greater heights, coordinating 
shelters for 5,800 individuals and 1,315 animals--an extraordinary feat 
of operational precision and compassion. Despite personal hardships, 
including one case manager losing her home while another lost her 
rental property, the team prioritized the welfare of the community, 
working tirelessly to ensure safety and stability for all. Post-storm, 
the team was responsible for helping shelter residents whose homes were 
no longer safe, find appropriate alternatives for housing. Their 
dedication shone through in rapid response efforts. In the days 
immediately following Hurricane Helene, 49 residents received critical 
assessments and essential resources. After Hurricane Milton, they 
worked with 225 displaced individuals who remained in shelters, 
demonstrating their unparalleled ability to adapt and respond under 
pressure. The team leveraged the Human Services Needs app to streamline 
disaster case management, supporting 1,351 residents. Their follow-up 
system, in partnership with other agencies, ensured personalized 
service for every individual. This innovative approach epitomized their 
ability to harness technology and partnerships for meaningful impact. 
Beyond immediate relief, the team worked with individuals and families 
who would require long-term recovery efforts. For approximately 150 
permanently displaced residents, they implemented a housing eligibility 
process, with the intent of ensuring fair and transparent allocation of 
resources. By securing placements at facilities like Pasco Hope, the 
team supported individuals and families along a pathway to rebuild 
their lives. Between September 28 and October 18, 2024, the team 
managed an overwhelming volume of calls--1,194 through their direct 
line and another 1,214 through work phones. Yet every call was met with 
care, professionalism, and actionable solutions, reflecting the team&#x27;s 
deep commitment to being a lifeline for the community. The Pasco County 
Human Services Team exemplifies what it means to serve with excellence, 
compassion, and innovation. Their remarkable achievements during 
Hurricanes Helene and Milton, coupled with their dedication to long-
term recovery and cutting-edge approaches to disaster management, have 
left an indelible mark on Pasco County.
  It is clear Kyle Smith has made a profoundly positive impact on our 
community with his work as part of the Pasco County Human Services 
Team, and I am grateful for his service. May we all strive to serve our 
communities with the same dedication and humility.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Laurie Swink has made to our community through her 
work with Selah Freedom. Laurie&#x27;s passion, tireless efforts, and 
unwavering commitment to fighting human trafficking have not only 
impacted the lives of thousands but have sparked systemic change across 
the Nation. With over 7,000 survivors of human trafficking having found 
hope, healing, and a new chance at life through Selah Freedom&#x27;s 
programs, Laurie&#x27;s legacy continues to shape a future where survivors 
are empowered and human trafficking is eradicated. Laurie Swink co-
founded Selah Freedom in 2011, with a clear mission to address the 
growing crisis of human trafficking and to restore freedom and dignity 
to those trapped in it. Since then, her leadership has been a catalyst 
for change, and her vision for Selah Freedom has transformed the 
organization into a national leader in anti-trafficking efforts. Laurie 
has worked tirelessly to create programs that provide more than just 
temporary relief; she&#x27;s built a holistic, long-term framework that 
addresses the multifaceted needs of survivors. Under Laurie&#x27;s 
leadership, Selah Freedom provides survivors with safe housing, trauma-
informed counseling, legal advocacy, life skills training, job 
readiness programs, and educational opportunities. This comprehensive 
support system has allowed victims to heal, regain independence, and 
lead successful lives beyond the trauma of trafficking. The impact 
Laurie has made is visible not only in the numbers but in the 
individual success stories of survivors who are now thriving--getting 
jobs, going to school, and, in many cases, becoming advocates 
themselves. Laurie is a compassionate leader who connects with 
survivors on a personal level, understanding their unique challenges 
and walking alongside them every step of the way. Laurie&#x27;s deep empathy 
and ability to listen, care, and offer practical solutions have 
empowered survivors to overcome the seemingly insurmountable obstacles 
they face. Laurie has become a powerful voice in the fight against 
human trafficking, using her platform to raise awareness, educate 
communities, and advocate for change at the policy level. Laurie has 
worked with law enforcement, legislators, and local leaders to 
strengthen laws, increase resources for trafficking victims, and ensure 
that survivors have the support they need to rebuild their lives. She 
has played a key role in transforming how society understands and 
addresses human trafficking, ensuring that the issue is no longer 
hidden or overlooked.
  It is clear Laurie Swink has made a profoundly positive impact on our 
community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to 
serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

      RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN &amp; COUNTY CLUB

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN B. LARSON

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, May 13, 2025

  Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
100th anniversary of the Town &amp; County Club in the historic Asylum Hill 
neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut. Over its storied 100-year 
history, the club has grown into the premier location for members to 
enjoy organized social, intellectual, and artistic gatherings.
  On May 21, 1925, just five years after the 19th Amendment guaranteed 
women&#x27;s suffrage, 400 women founded the Town &amp; County Club as 
Hartford&#x27;s first private women&#x27;s club. The club&#x27;s first President, Miss 
Anne Eliot Trumbull, helped draft their Articles of Association. The 
Articles state that the club was formed with the purposes of ``creating 
an organized center for women&#x27;s work, thought and action; advancing the 
interests of women, promoting science, literature, and art; providing 
an accessible place of meeting for its members, promoting social 
intercourse by such means as the members of the corporation shall deem 
expedient and proper for that purpose, and for acquiring and 
maintaining and club house and grounds.&#x27;&#x27;
  The pioneering women who founded the Town &amp; County Club at a time 
when membership at most private clubs was exclusive to men created an 
organization worthy of its storied 100-year history. It is my honor to 
celebrate the Town &amp; County Club of Hartford, Connecticut.
