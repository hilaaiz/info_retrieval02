             CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH BRIAN HANNIGAN

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 15, 2023

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of 
Joseph Brian Hannigan, an active community leader and highly admired 
public servant who passed away on May 21, 2022, at the age of 76.
  Born in New York City in 1945, Brian Hannigan was raised in 
Wakefield, Rhode Island. Brian attended South Kingston High School and 
then went on to Saint Thomas More School in New Hampshire where he 
developed his gift for writing. He later went to Saint Louis University 
(SLU), becoming the President of SLU&#x27;s Young Democrats and ultimately 
became Chair of the College Democrats of Missouri.
  In college, Brian served as chair of the Robert F. Kennedy for 
President club, which launched his career in Democratic political 
campaigns. His passion for politics led him to a job as the Scheduling 
and Advancing Director for the Governor of Illinois. Throughout his 
life, no higher complement could be paid than referring to him as a 
`great advance man.&#x27;
  While in Illinois, he met his wife, Judy, on a double date in 
Chicago. They threw dance parties, traveled the world, and enjoyed 
foreign films together. Eventually, they left Illinois for Washington 
D.C., and Brian became the Deputy National Finance Director for the 
Democratic National Convention. His skills as an advance man with an 
encyclopedic memory and attention to details served him well in his 
roles on the advance teams for President Carter&#x27;s visit to Israel in 
1979 and President Clinton&#x27;s visit to Northern Ireland in 1995. His 
career went on to include numerous communications and government 
relations positions, including his time as Communications Director for 
the Virginia Baseball Stadium Authority and his time in Governor Mark 
Warner&#x27;s administration.
  Brian brought the same level of dedication and passion for national 
politics to his roles in the community. He served as President of the 
Dominion Hills Civic Association for over 20 years. Brian was also a 
staunch believer in the positive impact of youth sports, as he became 
the Chairman of the Arlington County Sports Commission, President of 
the Better Sports Club, and would often drive around Arlington to 
ensure that his children&#x27;s teammates could make it to practices and 
games.
  Those who had the pleasure of spending time with Brian know that he 
lived life to the fullest, whether that was `dancing like no one was 
watching,&#x27; looking for any excuse to go on a road trip, or refusing to 
pass up any opportunity to bodysurf a wave. He is loved dearly, and his 
passion and dedication has left a lasting impact on everyone who knew 
him.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and 
legacy of Joseph Brian Hannigan. His leadership and commitment to 
public service was inspirational, and he will be missed by all who knew 
him. I also extend my deepest condolences to his wife of 44 years, 
Judy, and his children, Connor and Megan, and their families.

                          ____________________

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2670, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR 
                            FISCAL YEAR 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today in favor 
of the Conference Report on the Fiscal Year 24 NDAA. This conference 
report is the result of bipartisan efforts to strengthen our national 
defense while supporting our military members, families, and 
communities. I would like to thank Senator Reed, Senator Wicker, 
Chairman Rogers, and Ranking Member Smith for their leadership 
throughout the entire process to produce this bipartisan bill.
  I would also like to thank Chairman Waltz of the Readiness 
Subcommittee for his partnership, Jeanine Womble the Readiness PSM, my 
MLA Rob Hurd, and my Defense Fellow Taylor Brunstad. I am proud of the 
work we have done to protect the Readiness of our Armed forces. This 
bill continues our work, along with our Senate colleagues, to support 
military families by providing more childcare centers, protect basic 
healthcare rights for women service members, support energy resiliency 
on our bases, increase base pay to retain and recruit top talent, and 
demand DoD accountability and transparency on spending to prevent 
wasteful use of taxpayer dollars.
  It is of vital importance to me to support our servicemembers and 
their families at bases like Travis Air force Base and ensure they have 
the housing, training, equipment, and the quality of life they need and 
deserve. I am proud to continue my work to serve the men and women in 
my district, and to serve the brave men and women volunteering to 
protect our freedom. While this bill is a strong bipartisan effort to 
support the military, there is still more to be done and I look forward 
to building on these efforts in the years ahead.

                          ____________________

 DIRECTING CERTAIN COMMITTEES TO CONTINUE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
 WHETHER SUFFICIENT GROUNDS EXIST FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF JOSEPH BIDEN, 
                     PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 13, 2023

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 918, 
Republicans&#x27; baseless attempt to distract from the ongoing criminal 
proceedings against former President Donald Trump.
  After a year of frivolous investigations produced no evidence of 
wrongdoing by President Biden, Republicans brought to the floor a 
resolution directing committees to pursue a sham impeachment inquiry. 
This resolution is clearly an attempt to minimize and distract from 
former President Trump&#x27;s high crimes and misdemeanors, during the same 
week that his criminal trial proceedings reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
  While House Republicans have spent the year wasting time and taxpayer 
dollars, Democrats have delivered the votes to prevent a government 
shutdown--not once, but twice. This body has a duty to keep the 
government functioning and open for the American people, yet 
Republicans time and time again have shown no interest in meeting that 
obligation.
  As we approach the halfway point of the 118th Congress, it is clear 
the majority would rather spend their time distracting the American 
people with their extreme MAGA messaging instead of doing the serious 
work of legislating. It is past time for House Republicans to start 
addressing the serious and urgent needs of all our constituents.

                       Friday, December 15, 2023

  Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and honor the Rev. 
Dr. Luke Torian on his 35-year career in ministry. Dr. Torian has 
dedicated his life to serving and ministering to others through his 
work in the church, in the community, and in Virginia&#x27;s House of 
Delegates.
  A strong believer in the power of education, Dr. Torian graduated 
with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Winston-Salem State University, 
followed by a Master of Divinity degree from the School of Theology at 
Virginia Union University, and finally a Doctor of Ministry degree from 
the School of Divinity at Howard University.
  Throughout his career, Dr. Torian has served in many roles including 
youth minister, associate pastor, and chaplain. In 1995, he was 
installed as Pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Dumfries, where he 
has led a vibrant congregation of more than 4,000 people. He has been a 
fixture of the community, providing his congregation with support, 
kindness, and fellowship. Dr. Torian has built a church community that 
ministers to its congregants through Sunday services, Bible studies, 
social activities, music and arts, scholarship opportunities, and more.
  Dr. Torian&#x27;s outstanding leadership has been recognized by many over 
the years. He was awarded the James Floyd Jenkins Pillar of Faith Award 
by Howard University, a reflection of his dedication to his work and 
his positive contributions to his community. As a trusted source of 
knowledge and service, his impact has extended past Prince William 
County--first with his appointment to the Virginia Board of Counseling 
by Virginia Governor Mark Warner, and later with his 2009 election to 
represent the 52nd District in the Virginia House of Delegates.
  As a Delegate, Dr. Torian has served his constituents faithfully, 
advocating to improve education and criminal justice policies in the 
Commonwealth. In 2020, he was chosen to chair the Virginia House 
Appropriations Committee--a historic appointment that made him the 
first African American in Virginia&#x27;s history to lead the Committee, and 
a role he will resume in 2024 as he continues his legislative service.
  As we look back on his career in the church, Dr. Torian has been a 
tremendous leader in his community, providing exceptional service and 
ministry to those in Prince William County and beyond. I am certain 
that his next chapter will also be guided by his love for service, love 
for learning, and his faith.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating and 
thanking Rev. Dr. Luke Torian, I wish him, his beloved wife Clarice and 
their daughter Constance, the very best as they prepare for the next 
step in his career.

that her children give her the drive to push harder in spite of the 
turbulence brought on by life.
  Rosland is an active member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated. 
She currently serves as second antibasileus in the Zeta Psi Zeta 
Chapter Clarksdale. She stands on the sorority&#x27;s founding principles: 
scholarship, service, sisterly love and finer womanhood. She is a board 
member for Reclaimed (The Village) in Marks, Mississippi. She is also a 
member of Silent Grove MB Church in Marks under the leadership of Rev. 
Ezra Towner, Jr. She serves on additional panels that work toward 
improving humanity and the community.
  Life has issued Rosland many trials and tribulations such as losing 
her dad at a young age, becoming a teen mom, suffering depression/
anxiety, and experiencing rejection. Her entire outlook on life changed 
August 5, 2006, when her mother suffered a heart attack and stroke, 
which caused an internal brain aneurysm. She began to focus on putting 
things in order by priority and doing things that made her happy. She 
tries to find the positive in every situation. If people were asked to 
describe her with three words, they would probably say that she is 
analytical, supportive, and compassionate. Her motto is: ``If God is in 
it, the devil can&#x27;t do you any harm&#x27;&#x27;.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing principal 
Rosland E. Clinton for her dedication in serving her school and 
community.

                          HON. RICHARD HUDSON

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 15, 2023

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the student 
athletes of Sandhills Community College&#x27;s (SCC) Court and Beach 
Volleyball Teams on being recognized as Academic All-Americans by the 
National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).
  SCC has a proud history of both academic and athletic excellence and 
is a regional leader on both fronts. I was proud to see so many SCC 
student athletes carry on this great tradition and be named to the 
2022-2023 Academic Teams of the Year.
  In particular, I would like to recognize the SCC Court and Beach 
Volleyball teams and the following members of these teams on their 
achievement of this honor. Student athletes, Emma Brown, Lannah 
Huneycutt, Keke Lawrence, Alyssa Maragelis, Anna Ty Ivey, Jalasia Ray, 
Mackenzie Swett, Rachel Burley, Olivia Barlowe and Britta Martin.
  Their great success in the classroom is proof that each of them truly 
embody what it means to be a student athlete. I think I speak for 
everyone in our community when I say they have made Pinehurst and the 
whole Moore County proud.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing the SCC Court and 
Beach Volleyball teams for this great achievement and to wish them 
continued success both on the court and in the classroom.

                          ____________________

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to congratulate the St. 
Louis Metro Area Chapter Coalition of Black Trade Unionists on their 
50th anniversary.
  For 50 years, CBTU has been the voice of Black workers within the 
trade union movement in St. Louis. By pushing organized labor to create 
more equitable conditions and meet the needs and aspirations of Black 
and low-income workers, CBTU has truly been a voice for the people.
  The Coalition of Black Trade Unionists played an integral role in 
defeating right-to-work in Missouri, and they never stopped fighting 
and coordinating workers across our region and state to vote and remain 
civically engaged. Through education and outreach, CBTU has been on the 
frontlines fighting for our workers, teachers, and most marginalized 
communities, and ensuring that our democracy is protected.
  St. Louis and I are forever grateful for CBTU&#x27;s unwavering 
solidarity. CBTU is continuously leading with compassion for our entire 
St. Louis community in the struggle for racial equity, justice, and 
freedom. Congratulations on 50 years of service.

                          ____________________

  HONORING THE WORK AND SERVICE OF RICH FITZGERALD, ALLEGHENY COUNTY 
                               EXECUTIVE

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. CHRISTOPHER R. DELUZIO

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 15, 2023

  Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the hard work and 
legacy of Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald.
  County Executive Fitzgerald is finishing up his third and final term 
in the county&#x27;s top elected position--one he has held since 2012.
  Born and raised in the City of Pittsburgh, Rich Fitzgerald graduated 
from Carnegie Mellon University. He and his wife, Cathy, have eight 
children. ``Fitz,&#x27;&#x27; as he is fondly called, is well-known for his work 
ethic and his ability to bring people and organizations together to 
tackle the biggest issues facing our region.
  He first was elected to the County Council in 1999 and served on the 
Council--including as Council President from 2004 through 2011--until 
his successful election as County Executive.
  Under his leadership, Allegheny County has seen strong and solid job 
growth, a diverse and growing economy, and an excellent quality of 
life. The 2020 Census is a testament to County Executive Fitzgerald&#x27;s 
leadership: for the first time in sixty years, the county&#x27;s population 
grew over a decade. He also led the region through the dark days of the 
COVID-19 pandemic with consistency and reassurance, striving to protect 
public health and keep the economy strong.
  While we only crossed paths in elected office a short period of time, 
I greatly appreciated his guidance, experience, and collaboration.
  Fitz is a public servant through and through. Though he closes this 
chapter as Allegheny County Executive, the impact of his work for the 
Common Good will remain.
  On behalf of the good people of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 17th Congressional 
District, I thank Fitz for his years of service.

                          ____________________

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to wish a happy 103rd 
birthday to Willie James Thomas Sr. On behalf of Missouri&#x27;s First 
District, we are thankful for everything he is and everything he has 
done to provide for his family, neighbors, coworkers, and friends.
  One hundred and three is a remarkable milestone and worthy of great 
celebration. Mr. Thomas has seen and lived through segments of history 
that most of us can only rely on through books and education, and from 
being in close community with elders like him. His trials, triumphs, 
and everything in between are a beautiful testament to a remarkable and 
full life.
  Throughout his life, Mr. Thomas has had many blessings. He is the 
beloved father of three, a grandfather of 10, a great-grandfather of 
21, and great-great-great-grandfather of six. As a World War II Army 
Veteran serving in England, France, and Germany, we thank him for his 
dedication to his family and service to our country
  I am so grateful for the opportunity to celebrate his life because it 
is an inspiration to so many of us in St. Louis. I wish Mr. Thomas 
peace and continued joy tending to the best yard in University City 
throughout his 103rd year.
  Happy birthday and bountiful blessings to Mr. Willie James Thomas Sr.

                          ____________________

                 RECOGNIZING PRESIDENT LYNETTE ZELEZNY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. KEVIN McCARTHY

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 15, 2023

  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my friend and 
colleague, Congressman David Valadao, to recognize President Lynette 
Zelezny on her retirement today as President of California State 
University, Bakersfield. Over the course of her 35-year career in the 
education field, President Zelezny has inspired students, professors, 
and administrators through her passion for improving the academic 
success of our next generation, especially within the California State 
University system.
  President Zelezny&#x27;s career with the California State University 
system started in 1974 with her enrollment in Humboldt State 
University, where she earned her Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Psychology in 
1979 and her Master&#x27;s Degree in Psychology in 1981. Following her 
completion of a Doctorate in Social Psychology at Claremont Graduate 
University and an MBA from the Craig School of Business at California 
State University, Fresno, President Zelezny stayed at Fresno State, 
serving in a variety of educational and leadership roles. Most notably, 
President Zelezny served as Chief Academic Officer, Provost and Vice 
President of Academic Affairs at Fresno State. In 2018, President 
Zelezny made history when she became the first female President of 
California State University, Bakersfield.
  Over the past five years, under President Zelezny&#x27;s leadership, 
California State University, Bakersfield has successfully navigated new 
challenges and achieved several important milestones. She not only led 
the university through the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic but did so 
with an unwavering commitment to the well-being of students and 
faculty. One of President Zelezny&#x27;s top achievements has been 
developing CSUB&#x27;s California Energy Research Center into a robust hub 
for energy research throughout the Central Valley. As Kern County gains 
and sustains ever more national importance as a hub for energy 
production, future generations in our region will look back on 
President Zelezny&#x27;s initiative with great appreciation.
  A true champion of Central Valley education, particularly in 
Bakersfield, President Zelezny&#x27;s passion for the community has been a 
driving force behind her efforts. She recognized the unique challenges 
and opportunities presented in the region and strengthened the ties 
between the university and our community.
  On behalf of the Central Valley of California, we would like to 
express our gratitude for President Zelezny&#x27;s leadership to California 
State University, Bakersfield and her role in shaping the future 
careers of countless students. We would like to congratulate President 
Zelezny on a well-deserved retirement, a successful career in 
education, and for her many contributions to our community.
