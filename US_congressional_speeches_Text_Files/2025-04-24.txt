                        CELEBRATING BASIL PIAZZA

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Mr. Basil 
Piazza, a dedicated public servant and long-time resident of 
Williamsville, New York whose tireless contributions to his community 
and his country have left a long lasting impact. Mr. Piazza&#x27;s legacy 
spans decades of leadership, service, and unwavering commitment to the 
betterment of the Village of Williamsville.
  A native of North Buffalo, Mr. Piazza graduated from Canisius 
University in 1965 with a degree in English. After relocating in 1968 
to the Village of Williamsville with his family, he began a successful 
teaching career for 36 years throughout Western New York. His 
commitment to education and mentorship, even while serving in local 
government, speaks to his selflessness and passion for helping others 
succeed.
  Mr. Piazza has dedicated nearly three decades of public service to 
the Village of Williamsville, including the roles of Village Trustee, 
Deputy Mayor, and Mayor. His leadership has shaped the growth and 
development of Williamsville, as he worked tirelessly to improve his 
community. His dedication to enhancing the quality of life for 
residents, fostering community engagement, and promoting the arts and 
culture within the village has left an inedible mark on the area.
  Mr. Piazza&#x27;s legacy extends beyond his years of service as a public 
servant and educator. He has made profound contributions to the United 
States by serving in the Army Reserve for 26 years while remaining 
devoted to his family as a husband and father--later becoming a loving 
grandparent, and great-grandparent. His legacy stands as a foundation 
for the community values he worked to uphold throughout his life.
  Mr. Speaker, today we recognize Mr. Basil Piazza for his steadfast 
commitment to public service and his outstanding contributions to the 
Village of Williamsville. His dedication continues to inspire all who 
had the privilege of working with him, and his legacy is certain to 
live on for generations.

CELEBRATING THE 300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REFORMED CHURCH IN THE UNITED 
                                 STATES

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Reformed Church in the 
United States.
  The Reformed Church in the United States was founded in 1725, 
proclaiming the Gospel while serving communities across our Nation.
  I&#x27;m especially honored to note the pivotal role that South Dakota 
churches have played in advancing the mission and heritage of the 
Reformed Church in the United States through the Eureka Classis and 
beyond.
  During the Revolutionary War, one-fifth of German Reformed pastors 
served as chaplains in the Continental Army. One member, Captain Peter 
Humrickhouse, even crossed the Delaware River with General George 
Washington and delivered critical supplies to Yorktown, helping secure 
our Nation&#x27;s independence.
  Presidents George Washington and Theodore Roosevelt both recognized 
the influence and integrity of the Reformed Church. President 
Washington openly praised the loyalty and devotion of its clergy and 
congregants. President Roosevelt regularly attended Grace Reformed 
Church in Washington, D.C. and laid its cornerstone himself.
  This June, members and friends of the Reformed Church in the United 
States will gather at Mount Rushmore in my home state to mark this 
historic tricentennial milestone. It is fitting that such a celebration 
should occur in South Dakota, a state shaped by faith, perseverance, 
and patriotism.
  Join me in recognizing the Reformed Church in the United States for 
300 years of devotion to faith and service.

                          ____________________

               CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF METRA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BILL FOSTER

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a milestone in 
Illinois&#x27; transportation history, the 40th anniversary of Metra, which 
has been an essential part of the fabric of our region&#x27;s transportation 
network.
  Since its founding in 1984, Metra has provided reliable, safe, and 
efficient rail service for millions of residents and commuters 
throughout the Chicagoland area. Metra plays a crucial role in 
connecting neighborhoods, supporting local businesses, and ensuring 
that individuals can travel easily to work, school, and recreational 
activities.
  As the second-largest commuter rail system in the United States, 
Metra has helped foster economic growth by supporting both suburban and 
urban development and providing a convenient and sustainable 
alternative to driving. With 243 stations and 11 routes spanning nearly 
500 route miles, Metra connects communities across the six-county 
Chicago area. Serving over 300,000 riders on an average weekday, Metra 
is the backbone of the region&#x27;s transit system, enabling people to 
commute safely, reliably, and efficiently.
  Over the last four decades, Metra has adapted to the evolving needs 
of its riders, weathered economic challenges, and embraced innovations 
in technology to enhance the rider experience. The agency&#x27;s leadership 
has embraced modern technologies, improved accessibility, and 
continuously enhanced customer service to meet the growing demands of 
its passengers. Whether through the expansion of services, improvements 
to stations, or the adoption of innovative rail solutions, Metra has 
remained dedicated to serving the people of Illinois with the highest 
standards of service.
  Today, we recognize the hard work and dedication of Metra&#x27;s 
employees--from conductors to engineers, from planners to customer 
service representatives--whose efforts have helped ensure the continued 
success of this critical public transportation system.

[[Page E339]]

  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Metra 
and extend my deepest appreciation to everyone who has contributed to 
its success. I look forward to continuing to work with Metra as it 
builds on its remarkable 40 years of safe and reliable commuter rail 
service in the Chicagoland area.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. SHARICE DAVIDS

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
commemorate National Auctioneers Week, taking place this year between 
April 28 and May 3.
  The National Auction Association, located in the Kansas Third 
District, is the centralized headquarters for all auctioneering 
businesses, and I thank them for their advocacy on this matter. 
Additionally, I would like to recognize Livestock Marketing Association 
and the National Auto Auction for their advocacy work on this.
  An auction is one of the oldest methods of purchasing and selling 
goods and remains a prevalent practice in businesses throughout the 
country. And with rising prices, auctioneering remains a steady method 
of both purchasing and selling goods competitively. Auctions, and the 
auctioneers that run them, allow buyers an equal chance of receiving 
competitive prices for purchases and also allow the seller to receive 
the best possible return.
  The hardworking auctioneers that spend their time coordinating with 
clients and holding these events deserve recognition, and so I heartily 
support National Auctioneers Week.

CONGRATULATING THE YOUNGSTOWN STATE WOMEN&#x27;S BOWLING TEAM ON WINNING THE 
                     2025 NCAA BOWLING CHAMPIONSHIP

                                 ______

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. RULLI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Youngstown 
State women&#x27;s bowling team on winning the 2025 NCAA bowling 
championship over Jacksonville State on April 12, 2025.
  In the ``Entertainment Capital of the World&#x27;&#x27;, Las Vegas, the 
Youngstown State women&#x27;s bowling team certainly put on a show. The path 
to the championship was vigorous, playing against very tough 
competition to secure the championship win.
  The Penguins cruised through the regional rounds on the way to the 
championship and in the semifinals, the Penguins fell short to 
Jacksonville State 2-1. In the finals, the Penguins defeated the No. 2 
seed 2-0 to advance to the national championship against Jacksonville 
State.
  Looking for revenge, the Penguins came out of the gate swinging, 
winning the first two games by the scores of 204-199 and 248-210. The 
Penguins threw five strikes in the final four frames to win the first 
match and threw a strike on each of their final eight rolls in the 
second game. After Jacksonville State won game 3, the Penguins won game 
4, taking a 3-1 lead and one win away from the glory. Games 5 and 6 
were won by Jacksonville State to even the series 3-3. In game 7, the 
Penguins started strongly. Strikes and spares were the theme for the 
Penguins, showing the consistency that led them to the national 
championship game. With every strike and spare, the crowd roared, 
bringing the team one step closer to immortality. After back-to-back 
strikes to end the game, the team embraced, realizing their dreams and 
all their hard work had come to fruition. The Penguins forever etched 
themselves into history as champions.
  I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to 
join me in congratulating the Youngstown State women&#x27;s bowling team&#x27;s 
players, coaches, staff, families, and friends as we celebrate this 
historic victory and national championship. Go Penguins.

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary life 
and leadership of the late Mayor William F. Murphy, a public servant 
who dedicated his career to the betterment of Woodridge and its 
neighboring communities.
  Mayor Murphy&#x27;s 41 years of leadership, as Village Trustee from 1972 
until 1981 and then Mayor from 1981 until 2013, was paramount to the 
growth of Woodridge into the thriving village we see today. His 
negotiations brought water from Lake Michigan to DuPage County and 
sustained Argonne National Laboratory&#x27;s research capabilities. He 
served in countless organizations, including as president of the DuPage 
Mayors and Managers Conference and the Illinois Municipal League, 
demonstrating Murphy&#x27;s aspiration to use local government to uplift the 
community.
  Mayor Murphy remained deeply thoughtful and responsive to his 
residents&#x27; challenges. He consistently listened to their feedback and 
worked towards addressing their needs. Mayor Murphy also championed the 
ProLogis Fund, providing college scholarships and non-profit grants to 
empower the next generation of leaders and advocates. In addition, 
Mayor Murphy had a distinguished career as an educator, principal and 
Assistant Superintendent for 29 years for Woodridge School District 68, 
even having a local school named for him upon his retirement.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have represented such a dedicated leader 
who governed with the utmost humility. I ask you all to join me in 
honoring his legacy through the Woodridge Village Hall renaming. May 
the ``William F. Murphy Village Hall&#x27;&#x27; serve as a lasting reminder of 
his service to our community.

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Pastor Victor Hardy, a beloved community leader, committed advocate, 
and upstanding citizen of the City of Chandler. Victor passed away on 
March 22, 2025, at the age of 63, after a lifetime of faith, friendship 
and service. Chandler--and all of Arizona--is a kinder, more just place 
for his presence among us.
  Born and raised in Portsmouth, Virginia, Victor attended neighboring 
Norfolk State University where he studied music and performance. There, 
he met his beloved wife of 40 years, Cynthia. His lifelong devotion to 
serving God and his country was clear early in his life. After 
graduation, he served in the Virginia Army National Guard and the 
United State Air Force and pursued another degree in religious studies 
at Liberty University.
  The Chandler Community was blessed nearly 26 years ago, when Victor 
moved his family to their new home in Arizona. He volunteered 
tirelessly with the school districts, the city, Chandler Tullamore 
Sister Cities organizations, East Valley NAACP, and many other local 
organizations and nonprofits. His particular focus was to uplift 
African American men in our community. Over a decade ago, Victor 
founded the Chandler Men of Action, a profoundly impactful organization 
that empowers African American youth and honors the many contributions 
of African American men to Arizona. He became the first and only 
African American to hold the title of Executive Director at For Our 
City Chandler, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting collaboration and 
compassion in Chandler. In 2022, the Chandler City Council honored 
Victor with the MLK Lifetime Achievement Award to recognize his service 
to our community, which has helped to realize Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.&#x27;s dream of a better, more just Nation.
  Pastor Victor Hardy was ordained in 2012. Just three years later, he 
became the first African American solo pastor at the Congregational 
Church of the Valley. Victor built a welcoming and inviting space for 
congregants, and his congregation described him as a dedicated pastor--
and as a friend and mentor. He challenged his members to deepen their 
connection to their community and was a vocal champion of public 
servants, like our teachers and law enforcement officers--he even led a 
First Respondents Blessing each September.
  Victor&#x27;s love of music steered his service as well. Coming from three 
generations of African Methodist Episcopal church leaders, Victor&#x27;s 
musicality was fostered in church growing up. He founded and directed 
the Chandler Centennial Celebration Choir in 2012, created the Chandler 
High School Gospel Choir Club, and emceed the Chandler Symphony 
Orchestra Gala. Under his leadership, the Chandler High School Gospel 
Choir went on to perform at a number of high-profile shows.
  Pastor Victor Hardy&#x27;s dedication to the Chandler community is 
remarkable and deeply appreciated by the city&#x27;s residents. My prayers 
are with his family, including Cynthia and his sons, David, Julian and 
Patrick. Victor will be deeply missed by his congregation and all of 
those committed to justice and societal change. His compassionate 
legacy of service will be felt for generations to come--Arizona owes 
him a debt of gratitude. I thank Victor, and Godspeed.

Hero through her unwavering dedication to historic preservation, 
volunteerism, and community service. Her passion for preserving the 
cultural and architectural heritage of our town has left an indelible

conservation of our town&#x27;s most treasured landmarks. She has played a 
crucial role in securing grants and funding for preservation projects, 
working closely with local government and historical societies to 
ensure that our community&#x27;s history remains intact. Her leadership in 
restoration initiatives has not only beautified our town but has also 
increased public awareness about the importance of preserving our

that were once in danger of demolition have been revitalized, 
contributing to the town&#x27;s unique character and charm. Beyond her work

countless hours to various community projects. She has been 
instrumental in organizing events that celebrate our local heritage, 
including historical walking tours, educational workshops, and town-
wide clean-up efforts. Her ability to bring people together and inspire 
civic pride has strengthened the community&#x27;s appreciation for its past 
while fostering a sense of unity and belonging among its residents. 
Andrea&#x27;s service extends beyond preservation efforts. Andrea 
consistently demonstrates a deep commitment to the well-being of 
others. Her selflessness and drive to create positive change make her a 
role model for all who know her. Her leadership and generosity have 
earned her are admiration of both peers and community members. Andrea 
is not one to seek recognition for her contributions; she simply 
believes in making a difference. Her work has inspired many to take an 
active role in preserving the town&#x27;s history and engaging in 
volunteerism, creating a ripple effect that will be felt for years to 
come. Andrea Read&#x27;s tireless efforts in historic preservation, her 
unwavering dedication to volunteerism, and her commitment to community 
service make her a truly deserving recipient of the Local Hero Award. 
Her passion for preserving the past, coupled with her devotion to 
improving the present, has left a lasting legacy in Brooksville.
  It is clear Andrea Read has made a profoundly positive impact on our 
community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to 
serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Carol Berti has made on through her work with Oasis 
Pregnancy Centers. Carol is a rare gem in the volunteer world;

was an integral part of the start-up of Oasis in 2009 and continues to 
be a cornerstone of the ministry at the Land O&#x27; Lakes center. Her 
unwavering desire to be a light to each woman who walks through the

call on her life. Carol helps vet new volunteers and works with Center 
Directors to find the right fit for each volunteer and for Oasis. Carol 
is an inspiration to the staff and the team she serves with. 
Additionally, Carol has served for years as a Sunday School teacher

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Carol Brisbois has made through her work with 
Metropolitan Ministries. Carol has been a dedicated volunteer at 
Metropolitan Ministries since 2016. Monday and Friday mornings at the 
Metro Welcome Center are lively and welcoming, thanks to this 
remarkable woman. She greets both new and returning volunteers with 
enthusiasm, ensuring newcomers feel comfortable and understand the 
importance of their roles. Her humor, empathy, and dedication ensure 
smooth operations across all areas, from kitchen prep to client 
shopping in the metro market. She welcomes everyone--volunteers, 
clients, residents, and community members--with warmth, compassion, and 
genuine joy in service. Carol is always ready to tackle any task that 
needs attention. Metropolitan Ministries relies heavily on her to keep 
Volunteer Services running smoothly, not just during the holidays but 
all year round. She embodies the four key values of Metro&#x27;s culture, 
including: Character, Chemistry, Competency, and Calling.

our community, and I am grateful for strive to serve our communities

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. BARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly 
extraordinary American, Marjorie Ann Smith Curtiss, who is celebrating 
her 100th birthday today. Born in 1925, Marjorie has spent the past 
century as a proud Michigander whose life has been defined by strength, 
service, and resilience.
  In 1943, during the Second World War, Marjorie became one of the 
original ``Rosies,&#x27;&#x27; embodying the spirit of Rosie the Riveter and 
stepping up to support her Nation on the home front. Immediately after 
her high school graduation, Marjorie volunteered at the Chevrolet plant 
near her home in Flint, Michigan, where she worked on rehabilitating 
military trucks for the front lines. A few months later, Marjorie 
became an inspector, where she played a critical role in maintaining 
records on the Briggs &amp; Stratton airplane engines being rebuilt at the 
facility until the operation closed in 1945.
  Marjorie&#x27;s legacy, however, goes far beyond the factory floor. After 
marrying her husband John David Curtiss, she raised four children, put 
herself through nursing school, and achieved a career in the field. 
Today, she is the proud matriarch of a growing family that includes 
seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren. Her legacy of 
love, perseverance, and hard work continues to shine through them.
  Mr. Speaker, Marjorie Curtiss is an exceptional woman who answered 
the call to support her Nation in its darkest hour. Her story, which is 
woven into the fabric of our Nation, is nothing short of remarkable. I 
urge my colleagues to join me and all of Michigan&#x27;s Seventh 
Congressional District in wishing her a very happy 100th birthday.

                       RECOGNIZING THE JOLLY BOYS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 24, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor the Jolly Boys of Williamsville, New York, a remarkable group of 
volunteers whose dedication to serving their community has been a 
shining example of generosity and selflessness for over five decades. 
What began in 1971 as a small group of parents from the Village of 
Williamsville coming together to support their children&#x27;s involvement 
in local sports has grown into a community-wide effort to assist those 
in need, making a lasting impact on countless lives.
  The origin of the name Jolly Boys is a charming pan of the group&#x27;s 
history. It was coined by the wife of one of the founding members, who 
observed the group&#x27;s infectious spirit and glee, who in turn, began 
referring to

[[Page E338]]

them as the ``Jolly Boys&#x27;&#x27;. The name stuck, and to this day, the Jolly 
Boys of Williamsville continue to symbolize that spirit with everything 
they do.
  From the very start, the Jolly Boys set themselves apart by 
committing to a simple yet profound mission: to raise funds exclusively 
for local children and families facing financial difficulties, 
primarily through youth sports and activities. They embraced the values 
of volunteerism, ensuring that all their efforts were carried out by 
volunteers and that every dollar raised went directly to those in need. 
Through their commitment, the Jolly Boys have transformed the lives of 
many, providing vital resources and support to families in 
Williamsville and beyond.
  As their efforts expanded, the Jolly Boys continued to evolve, they 
were able to start using their resources to support homeless shelters, 
cancer research, local parks, and historic preservation efforts. Their 
commitment to the community has never shifted, and their impact will be 
seen and felt for centuries to come.
  Mr. Speaker, today we recognize the Jolly Boys for their 
contributions to not only the lives of individuals and families but 
have also strengthened our community. I ask that I am joined to express 
gratitude for the Jolly Boys of Williamsville, whose spirit of 
volunteerism and selflessness should serve as an inspiration to all.
