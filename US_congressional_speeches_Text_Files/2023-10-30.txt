                 CELEBRATING MAYOR JOYCE WHICHARD-BROWN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DONALD G. DAVIS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 30, 2023

  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I honor a remarkable 
leader, trailblazer, and advocate for the beloved Town of Williamston. 
It is my distinct privilege to stand before you and pay tribute to a 
woman whose dedication and unwavering commitment to our community have 
left an indelible mark on our hearts and history books. Today, I 
celebrate Mayor Joyce Whichard-Brown, the first African American and 
first female mayor of Williamston.
  Mayor Whichard-Brown&#x27;s leadership journey began in Williamston, where 
she was born and graduated from EJ Hayes High School. She then moved to 
Virginia and worked in the U.S. Patent Office and various private law 
practices. In 2005, she returned to her hometown, Williamston, North 
Carolina, and has served as mayor since 2015.
  Her accomplishments extend far beyond Williamston. She served on the 
North Carolina League of Municipalities Board of Directors. She has 
also taken on the role of vice chair of the Highway 17/64 Commission 
and initiated the quarterly mayor&#x27;s meetings, fostering regional 
partnerships and cooperation. Under her guidance, the Town has seen 
significant improvements, such as the major upgrade to a fire 
department building and the transformation of the Stalls Building into 
a state-of-the-art police department facility. Mayor Whichard-Brown 
secured approval for the renovation of Gaylord Perry Park, making it 
more accessible and enjoyable for citizens.
  Her tireless efforts also led to a substantial HUD grant of $750,000, 
dedicated to housing revitalization and downtown renovation. Moreover, 
she was pivotal in securing over $1 million in grants to complete the 
Roanoke River Boardwalk.
  New businesses have thrived under her leadership, raising property 
tax-assessed values and breathing new life into the Town. Mayor 
Whichard-Brown has shown unshakable resolve, a willingness to stand her 
ground, and a remarkable ability to maintain her sense of humor. She 
led with grace, strength, and an unwavering commitment to her 
community.
  Retiring from the Town, she can spend more time with her two 
children, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Let&#x27;s not 
forget Mayor Whichard-Brown&#x27;s lesser-known talent, her incredible 
singing voice, which she generously shares at an annual stampede.
  I thank her for her service and look forward to the continued 
positive impacts in the town.

                          ____________________

                        HONORING CRAIG McNAMARA

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 30, 2023

  Mr. THOMPSON of California, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Craig 
McNamara, of Winters, California, as we celebrate the 30th anniversary 
of the Farming, Agriculture, and Resource Management for Sustainability 
(FARMS) Program.
  Craig McNamara was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After traveling by 
motorcycle across Central and South America to learn more about the all 
of agriculture. Mr. McNamara enrolled at the University of California, 
Davis where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in plant and soil sciences. 
He then apprenticed under Tom Lum of Dixon for three years and would 
later rent his first 100 acres of farmland and establish Sierra 
Orchards.
  In 1993, Craig and his wife, Julie, founded the FARMS Program giving 
high school students access to applied scientific research and careers 
in agriculture, conservation, and sustainability. The FARMS Program 
grew to become a model practice for youth education throughout the 
nation and led to the establishment of the Center for Land-Based 
Learning in 2001.
  Since its founding, the Center for Land-Based Learning has educated 
more than 25,000 students from 30 different California counties. The 
Center for Land-Based Learning is the only organization of its kind in 
the state to offer a closed loop of agriculture-based education, 
internships, and careers. Because of the program high school students 
and adults have had the opportunity to discover impactful careers in 
fields ranging from biological sciences and technology-aided farming to 
land-use management and robotics.

[[Page E1031]]

  As an American farmer and activist, Mr. McNamara was revolutionary in 
the field of sustainable, climate-smart agricultural practices. He 
endured years of skepticism from those steeped in antiquated beliefs, 
but that did not slow down his work. Today, modern environmental 
science and economics embrace Mr. McNamara&#x27;s teaching which emphasizes 
that ``people, profit, and planet&#x27;&#x27; all deserve equal attention and 
dedication.
  Throughout his professional career, Mr. McNamara has served as a 
board member for the American Farmland Trust; the Roots of Change 
Stewardship Council; University of California, Davis Dean&#x27;s Advisory 
Council and Agricultural Sustainability Institute Advisory Board; and 
the Public Policy Institute of California Advisory Board, He is 
currently a board member on the Edible Schoolyard Project and Project 
REGEN. He is also on the leadership council of the Public Policy 
Institute of California.
  Mr. Speaker, Craig McNamara is a dedicated public servant and leader 
in our community. He has inspired and educated future generations of 
farmers and agricultural leaders. It is therefore fitting and proper 
that we honor him and the work of the FARMS Program here today.

                        Monday, October 30, 2023

  Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Milton Jones, an East 
Tennessean who served our country in the U.S. Navy and worked on the 
Manhattan Project.
  Milton grew up with an interest in technology and how it works, which 
would serve him well throughout his career. After he graduated from 
Farragut High School in 1941, Jones earned a first class radio license 
from Madison College in Nashville. He then went on to train the Army 
Signal Corps until he was called back to Tennessee to help on the 
Manhattan Project.
  After the end of World War II, Milton started at WIVK radio as a 
chief engineer and proceeded to help set up new stations throughout the 
South. He retired in 1993, but continued to work as a consultant for 
different radio stations and helped tune their towers.
  Milton raised four children with his wife Anna Ruth Atkins, and 
turned 101 years old in March of 2023. He has served his country and 
his family well, and the East Tennessee community is thankful for the 
impact he has had on those who have been fortunate enough to know him.

disabilities, food insecurities, safety concerns, lack of 
transportation, and a host of other physical and social issues.

Technical High School, and the non-public Holy Trinity, St. Marks, and 
St. Ephrem elementary schools, and Conwell-Egan High School.
  Covid Relief through Darletta&#x27;s collaboration with the United Way, 
Lower Bucks Chamber of Commerce, area grocery stores, houses of 
worship, and local law enforcement agencies in providing meals for 
families and individuals in addressing grocery shopping, transportation 
needs, providing holiday experiences for the less fortunate of all 
ages, and shelter for the young, the homeless, the abused, and senior 
citizens.
  Coordinating efforts to support law enforcement agencies by securing 
a COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) grant through the United 
States Department of Justice for the Borough of Morrisville; successful 
submission of COPS grant applications for Falls Township and Bensalem

Women and Women Who Make a Difference awards presented by the Bucks

  We are incredibly grateful for the impact Darletta Berry-Johnson has

and wish for her continued success as she continues to serve our 
community.

                        Monday, October 30, 2023

  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize delivery 
driver Phillip Jackson of Thurston County for his remarkable 
perceptivencss that helped to reunite a five-year-old boy with his 
mother. While making a delivery to a West Olympia Texaco, Phillip 
noticed an unaccompanied boy without shoes or a shirt walking around 
the convenience store. Sensing that something was amiss, Phillip 
immediately sprang into action and called 911. It was Phillip&#x27;s 
initiative in alerting authorities of the situation that allowed local 
law enforcement, who had already been working with the boy&#x27;s mother 
after she had reported him missing, to locate the child. Even after the 
police had arrived, Phillip remained with the boy until the mother and 
her child were reunited. Phillip credits his intervention to a 
workplace training he took that teaches delivery drivers to recognize 
signs of human trafficking and children at risk on the road. I applaud 
Phillip&#x27;s awareness and quick action to help keep our most vulnerable 
members of our community safe and I am proud to recognize him today as 
our community&#x27;s Constituent of the Month.

following the passage of the 21st Amendment. Ed finally opened Horn&#x27;s

the day you can hear lively piano music drifting out the door and see 
eager customers dining on the renowned southwest cuisine. When the sun 
sets, the chairs are pulled aside, and the dance floor comes alive. 
Horn&#x27;s is a favorite late-night spot among locals, workers, and 
visitors alike.

  RETIREMENT SECURITY WORK ONGOING: AN UPDATE FOR NATIONAL RETIREMENT 
                             SECURITY MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. TIM WALBERG

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 30, 2023

  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a critical issue 
impacting millions of Americans who work hard every day so that, when 
the time comes, they can enjoy their golden years in retirement. 
October is National Retirement Security month, so it is a good time to 
both reflect on the retirement reforms we have recently enacted and 
look ahead to the remaining work to be done.
  America&#x27;s retirement savings system and the retirement outlook for 
millions has dramatically improved because of Congress&#x27;s bipartisan 
work over the last few years. Our private sector retirement savings 
system works well for many employees and employers, but additional 
improvements could help more Americans achieve a successful retirement 
for all.
  As a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce 
Committee. I was proud to play an active role in helping draft and 
advance the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 into law

[[Page E1029]]

last year. Building on the great work Congress achieved with the SECURE 
Act of 2019, SECURE 2.0 included almost 100 provisions that will help 
employers offer plans and assist employees in both beginning to save 
and saving more for retirement. I was especially pleased that my 
provision to reduce administrative costs for employers by increasing 
the cash-out limit for the first time in over two decades was included 
in the final law.
  One significant issue we still need to make more progress on is 
providing greater access to savings and income options that will help 
make sure retirees do not outlive their retirement savings. Americans 
collectively face a substantial retirement income gap. This means that 
the amount of money retirees have saved compared to what they need is 
$4 trillion short, with 40 percent of families likely to outlive their 
retirement savings, according to the Employee Benefit Research 
Institute.
  This gap is concerning, and why guaranteed, or lifetime income has 
long been a critical issue for me. A few years ago, as the Chairman of 
the House Committee on Education and the Workforce&#x27;s Health, 
Employment, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Subcommittee, I was proud to 
chair a hearing on a range of bipartisan retirement bills. One of the 
bills we discussed that day was the Increasing Access to a Secure 
Retirement Act, which I introduced with Representative Lisa Blunt 
Rochester to remove a regulatory barrier for employers looking to offer 
lifetime income solutions to their employees. That important provision 
became law in the SECURE Act, but our efforts to ensure everyone has 
access to the best lifetime income options remain ongoing.
  Earlier this year, I along with Representative Donald Norcross 
reintroduced the bipartisan Lifetime Income for Employees Act. This 
legislation would improve plan sponsors&#x27; and investors&#x27; default 
lifetime income options and take a crucial step to help American 
retirees have adequate income in retirement. Increasing the range of 
savings and income options will help provide workers with the 
possibility to achieve higher returns on their retirement investments 
and greater peace of mind that their income will last throughout 
retirement.
  Our bill, and other sensible steps to improve worker access to 
guaranteed lifetime income. must be a part of future bipartisan 
retirement saving packages. I am hopeful my colleagues will cosponsor 
the Lifetime Income for Employees Act and help us to enact it into law.
  In addition to expanding access to lifetime income Congress must do 
more to help all Americans achieve a financially secure retirement. 
More than 55 million Americans do not have access to an employer 
sponsored retirement plan, including 78 percent of workers at arms with 
fewer than 10 employees. Congress should continue to work to help them 
get access to savings plans as this is the first step to helping them 
achieve financial security in retirement.
  Let&#x27;s not wait until next year&#x27;s National Retirement Security Month 
to advance proposals that will strengthen our nation&#x27;s private 
retirement system. Bipartisanship has been and will continue to be the 
key to advancing the next retirement security package. We can and 
should act now to help all our constituents get on a clearer path to a 
more secure retirement.

 SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF PUTNAM COUNTY VETERAN OF THE YEAR, JOHN MULLINS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT E. LATTA

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 30, 2023

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Mr. John Mullins of Ottawa, Ohio, who has been named Putnam County 
Veteran of the Year. Every year, the Putnam County Veterans Service 
Commission recognizes a veteran from their county who has been 
honorably discharged, embodies the spirit of professional excellence, 
and has significant off-duty community service. After reviewing all the 
nominees, Mr. Mullins was selected for the honor.
  Mr. Mullins first entered the U.S. Armed Forces in 1980 and served in 
the U.S. Air Force. After leaving the Air Force in 1992, Mr. Mullins 
continued serving his community by joining the Ottawa Police 
Department. He served the City of Ottawa for twenty-five years as part 
of the police department, while also spending time as a volunteer 
firefighter for the Ottawa Fire Department. After leaving the police 
department, Mr. Mullins went on to become a deputy sheriff for the 
Putnam County Sheriffs Office where he is currently serving.
  Outside of his public service career, Mr. Mullins has been involved 
in the VFW, AmVets, and many other organizations that help raise 
awareness and fund veteran programs. He has helped with the POW/MIA 
programs for Putnam County while also organizing Ottawa Honor Guard for 
funerals and other events. Wherever it is possible to help a veteran in 
need, Mr. Mullins has dedicated his time to do so.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute 
to Mr. John Mullins of Ottawa, Ohio, on his selection as the Putnam 
County Veteran of the Year. On behalf of the people of the Fifth 
Congressional District of Ohio, I wish John all the best in his future 
endeavors and thank him for service to Putnam County and our Nation.

                          ____________________

      TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF THE HONORABLE RICHARD CLARENCE CLARK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANNA G. ESHOO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 30, 2023

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of a 
great American and former United States Senator, Richard Clarence 
Clark. Dick Clark was born on September 14, 1928, in Paris, Iowa, and 
died peacefully on September 20, 2023, at his home in Washington, D.C., 
at the age of 95.
  Dick Clark enlisted in the U.S. Army after high school and served his 
country in England during the Korean War. He earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree 
at Upper Iowa University and his Master&#x27;s at the University of Iowa. He 
then taught at Upper Iowa University, worked as a volunteer for the 
Democratic Party, and in 1972 he ran for the U.S. Senate. Partly in 
response to his unorthodox campaign tactic of actually walking 1,300 
miles across Iowa to meet the voters, he won the seat. He served on the 
Senate Foreign Relations, Agriculture and Public Works Committees and 
after losing his race in 1978, he was soon appointed Ambassador-at-
Large by President Jimmy Carter and spent most of 1979 serving as the 
administration&#x27;s coordinator for refugee affairs, working to provide 
aid and housing for tens of thousands of people fleeing wars and famine 
in Southeast Asia. He then worked on the presidential campaign of 
Senator Ted Kennedy and became a Senior Fellow at the Aspen Institute 
for Humanistic Studies.
  Dick Clark has been described as hardworking, studious, well-liked, 
and a highly respected Senator. He was all these and more. I first met 
him in 1994 when I was invited to participate in my first Aspen 
Institute Congressional Program as a newly elected Member of the House 
of Representatives. This program, initiated and directed by Dick Clark, 
fostered relationships with members of both parties and provided high 
value information on a variety of policies presented by experts and 
discussed by Members. Dick Clark said that ``good policy depends on 
informed policy makers&#x27;&#x27; and many minds were shaped and policies 
refined as a result of this superb Aspen Congressional Institute. Dick 
was as fine a human being one could ever know . . . a kind man of 
enormous integrity, a beautiful friend and a true patriot.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in 
paying tribute to this remarkable man, his life and his work, and in 
extending our most sincere condolences to his wife Julie, his three 
children, three grandchildren, and two great-grandsons. We are a better 
and stronger nation because of him.

                          ____________________
