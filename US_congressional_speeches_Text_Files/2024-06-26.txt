         CELEBRATING ROSEN HOTELS AND RESORT&#x27;S 50TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MAXWELL FROST

                                florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 26, 2024

  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, this month, I celebrate the significant 
contributions of Rosen Hotels to the Central Florida region. Starting 
with only one hotel, the Rosen organization has grown to over seven 
hotels, employing over 4,000 Central Floridians. The Rosen Hotels were 
established starting in 1974 and are now celebrating 50 years of 
service.
  Every year, the Rosen organization provides over 500 scholarships 
that benefit students in the Tangelo Park and Parramore areas. Most 
notably, Rosen Hotels has donated millions over its 50 years to 
creating the UCF Rosen School of Hospitality Management, which now 
ranks No. 1 in the Nation.
  The Rosen hotels have provided employment, welcoming stays, and 
memories to last a lifetime for many Floridians. I thank Rosen Hotels, 
for 50 years of dedication and service. Their contributions make a 
profound difference in our community, and we are grateful for their 
support and commitment to make Central Florida a better place for all.

    CONGRATULATING THE SANTA FE NEW MEXICAN ON ITS 175TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 26, 2024

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my 
hometown newspaper, the Santa Fe New Mexican, on its 175th Anniversary. 
The first issue of the paper was printed on November 28, 1849. The New 
Mexican has brought stories to life about gold strikes, floods, votes 
on prohibition, and debates on statehood. It has shared stories of the 
struggles and strength of the survivors of wildfires, informed voters 
about their local candidates, and anointed the best chile in the city. 
To keep democracy strong, it made sure voters understood the positions 
and perspectives of local candidates for office.
  Stories matter, and who tells them matters just as much. That&#x27;s why 
it&#x27;s important that an independent paper with integrity, like the New 
Mexican, has been telling stories about our communities since it was 
founded. Papers like the New Mexican help us be well informed, active 
citizens.
  In 2023, 34 reporters from the New Mexican won first place in the New 
Mexico Press Association Better Newspapers contest. Amongst the awards 
were best investigative reporting, best news writing, best feature 
photo, and best special section on the recovery from the Hermit&#x27;s Peak/
Calf Canyon fire in 2022.
  Independent journalism is a crucial foundation of democracy. That&#x27;s 
clear now more than ever, as we ward off fake news and alternative 
facts in the battle for our nation&#x27;s very soul.
  I still get a copy of the New Mexican delivered to my door every day. 
Their stories, from high school sports to national news are crucial to 
the work that I do. Most importantly, however, they are vital to the 
fabric of New Mexico.
  I like to think that future generations will sit with their cup of 
cafe and turn the pages to learn about their hometown from the Santa Fe 
New Mexican.

  Mr. MIKE GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
a member of CA-27&#x27;s Edwards Air Force Base who has served with passion 
for over 20 years. As a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air 
Force, John D. Stock has dedicated his life to serving our Nation and 
training the next generation of pilots.
  John D. Stock&#x27;s diligent service includes 3500 hours of flight time 
across two oceans and five continents. By executing successful 
operational missions, instructing pilots and aircrew personnel, and 
volunteering in his local community, his leadership has had a deep 
impact on the aviation community and beyond.
  I want to thank Lieutenant Colonel John Stock for his dedication and 
service. Our community is better because of him, and I look forward to 
seeing how he continues to make an impact on those around him.

           HONORING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF DAN FLAVIN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CLAY HIGGINS

                              of louisiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 26, 2024

  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Daniel Flavin, 
a uniquely integral Southwest Louisiana community leader. Dan&#x27;s career 
spanned business, politics, and philanthropy. No matter what his means 
were, he always worked to benefit those around him, his family, and 
God.
  Dan&#x27;s family moved to Lake Charles in 1972, where he attended and 
graduated from A.M. Barbe High School. Mr. Bill Flavin, Dan&#x27;s Father, 
was a Veteran of the Korean War and an industrious, self-made man. 
Despite generous offers that would force his family to leave the 
Southwest Louisiana community they had come to love, he resigned from 
his job and founded what is now the renowned Flavin Realty Inc. Dan 
once recalled that even at 86, his father still came to work every day. 
Mr. Bill Flavin clearly endowed Dan with this impulse for hard work and 
integrity. The Flavins&#x27; principles are emblematic of Southwest 
Louisiana&#x27;s grit and ingenuity.
  Dan bought Flavin Realty from his father after graduating from 
McNeese State University, inheriting it just as he had his fundamental 
values. Under Dan&#x27;s management, Flavin Realty steadily grew into the 
organization we know today: Southwestern Louisiana&#x27;s eminent real 
estate firm. In recognition of his personal ability, Dan was twice 
awarded the Calcasieu Parish Realtor of the Year Award and was selected 
for leadership positions in Louisiana&#x27;s top real estate associations. 
Dan always showed great humility in his achievements, always giving 
credit to family and God above all.
  Throughout his life, Dan&#x27;s personal integrity and dedication reached 
beyond his own interests, overflowing into the community. He gave 
generously to charity and local causes. In 1996, Dan brought his 
talents to the state legislature, where he served his beloved SWLA 
community. His decade-long tenure in the Louisiana House of 
Representatives was noted by constituents as an era of major victories 
and development. Representative Flavin&#x27;s greatest legislative work came 
amid efforts to bolster the Port of Lake Charles. His concerted 
legislation and advocacy made the Port of Lake Charles our Nation&#x27;s 
10th largest, cementing an irreplaceable source of SWLA economic 
prosperity for years to come.
  This unwavering dedication to community was surpassed only by Dan&#x27;s 
intertwined love of family and God. After retiring from the state 
legislature in 2005, Dan spent the joyful final years of his life 
caring for the family business, surrounded by his wife Lisa and their 
six children, 20 grandchildren, and a community of friends. Dan&#x27;s love 
of God, family, and community made him an exemplary Louisianan by any 
definition. His work was always conducted according to our state&#x27;s 
unique intersection of government, business, and family values.
  Dan is survived by a big, beautiful Louisiana family and a forever 
grateful community. On behalf of Louisiana&#x27;s 3rd District, I thank Mr. 
Dan Flavin for his generous charity and lifelong service to Louisiana. 
As we continue to benefit from Dan Flavin&#x27;s legacy, I pray the Lord 
blesses his family and grants his reward in Heaven.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 26, 2024

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Paul and Sandra 
``Sandy&#x27;&#x27; Pimentel. Both raised in Quincy, Massachusetts, Paul and 
Sandy first met as kids and began a friendship that would last a 
lifetime and eventually grow into a marriage spanning five decades. 
After graduating high school, Paul went on to attend Harvard 
University, where he received a degree in engineering and applied 
physics, before serving in Vietnam as a lieutenant in the United States 
Army. Sandy went on to attend the University of Massachusetts Boston 
and the Lynn Hospital School of Nursing, where she respectively 
received her

[[Page E669]]

Bachelor of Arts in management of human services and a degree in 
nursing. After Paul and Sandy got married in 1965, the young couple 
moved to Long Beach, California, while Paul completed his military 
training, before moving to Albion, Michigan, where the Pimentels 
settled for many years with their children. In Albion, Sandy and Paul 
became active in forums and discussions at their church regarding 
racial integration and inequality as the civil rights movement 
continued to progress. It was also during this time that Sandy became 
friends with Barbara Gladney, and together the Pimentels and Gladneys 
started a dinner club called the ``Melting Pot.&#x27;&#x27; The multicultural 
social group gained such popularity that the dinners had to be moved to 
large event halls. After returning to Massachusetts, Sandy and Paul 
continued their important work advancing social change. Paul became the 
youngest Deputy Secretary of State for Massachusetts and helped to 
create Vineyard Power, a clean energy cooperative bringing offshore 
wind power to the Cape and Islands. Sandy served as the Director of 
Human Services for the Norfolk County District Attorney&#x27;s office and 
received awards from the Department of Interior for her work 
implementing the Alliance Against Racism and Violence Program and from 
the State of California for her efforts to empower young people to 
address racism in their communities.
  Sadly, we lost Paul too soon on February 5, 2019, at the age of 76. 
Beyond their professional achievements, what Paul and Sandy valued most 
during their 53 years of marriage was their family. Together they 
raised their five children, Lisa, Christopher, Susan, Courtney, and 
Joanie, and many foster children. The hallmark of the Pimentel family 
has always been their dedication to uplifting those in their community 
and willingness to provide a warm and welcoming home for those who need 
it most. Over the years, the Pimentels have established themselves as a 
pillar of the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard community, serving on countless 
committees and boards for local organizations, including Martha&#x27;s 
Vineyard Community Services and the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Diversity 
Coalition Board of Trustees. To celebrate Sandy and Paul&#x27;s work and 
commitment to helping others, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Community Services is 
holding a dedication ceremony for the newly named Paul and Sandra 
Pimentel Early Childhood Center on June 26, 2024.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Paul and Sandy Pimentel, and I ask 
that my colleagues join me in thanking them and celebrating their 
dedication to supporting and advocating for those in their community.

accomplishments of Rear Admiral Dana Thomas as she retires from the 
United States Coast Guard this year. I applaud RADM Thomas for her 
dedication and service and congratulate her on this milestone.
  Promoted to Rear Admiral (Upper Half) in March 2019, RADM Thomas has 
had an exemplary military career, previously serving seven years in the 
U.S. Coast Guard and seven years in the U.S. Army. She received her 
Doctor of Medicine and Master of Public Health degrees from George 
Washington University School of Medicine and Public Health, and her 
Bachelor of Science in Honors Biology from the University of Maryland, 
College Park. She completed Command and General Staff College in 2005. 
She served her Internship in General Surgery at Tripler Army Medical 
Center and her residency at the Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute.
  From her work with the Centers for Disease Control and service on the 
Physician&#x27;s Professional Advisory Committee to the U.S. Surgeon 
General, to her current role as Director of Health, Safety, and Work-
life for the U.S. Coast Guard, RADM Thomas has continued her commitment 
to service and public health. Her experience, knowledge, and steadfast 
initiative have distinguished RADM Thomas as an outstanding leader who 
has exemplified honor, integrity, and professionalism throughout her 
career.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in leading this body in acknowledgement 
of the extraordinary contributions of Rear Admiral Dana Thomas. She has 
tirelessly devoted her time and expertise to the advancement of public 
health and I thank her for her honorable service to our great Nation.

   RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ANN ARBOR MEALS ON WHEELS 
                                PROGRAM

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 26, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Ann Arbor 
Meals on Wheels on the occasion of 50 years of service to the

community. The care and service that they provide to homebound members 
of the greater Ann Arbor community is worthy of commendation.
  Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels began in 1974 as a program to provide 
homebound neighbors with fresh, nutritious meals. Since then, the 
program has expanded its services to include pet food delivery, home 
energy efficiency kits, personal care items, and wellness checks during 
drop-offs. Additionally, the program offers recipients a variety of 
meals that are inclusive of dietary restrictions, nutritional risks, 
and cultural traditions. Their delivery of over 120,000 of these meals 
to over 430 clients every year shows a distinct level of dedication and 
commitment to the community.
  Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels is a community effort. It is led by the 
University of Michigan Health Department of Community Health Services 
and is made possible by the additional support of more than 250 
volunteers. Staff at the Patient Food and Nutrition Services at 
Michigan Medicine work six days a week to prepare meals while 
volunteers assist in delivering meals, completing wellness checks, and 
providing community members with compassion and support. Many times, 
they are the difference in isolation as they build connections and care 
for those they serve. Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels also works with Lucky 
Kitchen, Washtenaw County, the Huron Valley Humane Society, DTE Energy, 
and other local institutions. This network of partnerships and 
dedicated volunteers demonstrates the integration of the program in the 
community, as well as the extent of the impact of the program.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
50th anniversary of Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels. For the last half-
century, the program has been diligently serving homebound members of 
the community when they need it most. We thank Ann Arbor Meals on 
Wheels and its team members for their service, and we are excited to 
see how the program will continue to serve the community.
