COMMEMORATING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2025, AS NATIONAL ORANGE SHIRT 
                                  WEEK

                                  _____
                                 

                          HON. SHARICE DAVIDS

                               of kansas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 3, 2025

  Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
week of September 30, 2025, as National Orange Shirt Week. Also known 
as National Week of Remembrance, this designation aims to honor those 
who were forced to attend Indian boarding schools.
  From 1819 through the 1960&#x27;s, thousands of Indigenous children were 
forcibly removed from their traditional homelands to attend U.S. 
boarding schools. At these schools, countless children were stripped of 
their cultural identities, often through physical, sexual, 
psychological, industrial, and spiritual abuse and neglect, all with 
the goal of assimilation into non-Native culture.
  This issue is personal to me. My grandparents, Ruth Stacy and 
Lawrence Little George, both survived Indian Boarding Schools. I would 
not be here today if not for the resilience of my ancestors and those 
who came before me. Tragically, many other children of these schools 
never got to return to their families or their communities.
  Hearing the experiences of Indian boarding school victims and 
survivors serves to not only honor the Native spirit, but also to 
ensure that these types of injustices can never repeat themselves. It 
is for these reasons that I heartily support National Orange Shirt 
Week.

Church in Detroit, Michigan, as they celebrate 25 years of ministry and

numerous scholars and earned degrees and certificates from respected 
institutions, including Taylor University, Trinity Evangelical Divinity 
School, Trinity International University, Andersonville Theological 
Seminary, and Ecumenical Theological Seminary.
  Consecrated to the office of Bishop in 2021, he now serves on the 
Board of Bishops with the Deliverance Tabernacle Fellowship of 
Ministries. For 25 years, his church has uplifted Detroit through 
worship, education, service, and love. I congratulate Bishop Tony 
Shomari Marshall and the House of Prayer Institutional Church on this 
extraordinary milestone.

University Hospital, as well as the oldest and one of the most 
cherished members of ``I AM&#x27;&#x27; Temple Detroit for nearly forty-three

celebrate 100 remarkable years of her life. I thank her for being a 
light in many individuals&#x27; lives and wish her a wonderful birthday.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 3, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40th 
anniversary of Citizens for East Shore Parks (CESP), an extraordinary 
community organization founded in 1985 to protect open space and 
wildlife habitat and to provide recreational opportunities along the 
eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay.
  Through their tireless advocacy and partnership with community 
allies, CESP was instrumental in the creation of McLaughlin Eastshore 
State Park, which preserves and protects 8.5 miles of shoreline habitat 
and open space from the Bay Bridge to Richmond. This remarkable park 
provides Bay Area residents access to natural beauty and recreational 
opportunities in one of the Nation&#x27;s most urbanized regions.
  Over four decades, CESP has helped transform the East Bay shoreline 
from neglected dumping grounds into a connected landscape of parks, 
trails, and ecological preserves. Their efforts have supported the 
creation and protection of McLaughlin Eastshore State Park, Point 
Molate Park, Tom Bates Regional Sports Complex, the Bay Trail 
connection at Golden Gate Fields, and the Albany Bulb.
  Today, CESP continues to lead with vision and purpose, working toward 
incorporating the Golden Gate Fields property into McLaughlin Eastshore 
State Park and ultimately restoring the site to wetlands and marshes 
that will provide a resilient shoreline in the face of sea level rise. 
In this effort, CESP is committed to collaborating with Native American 
communities to restore these historically vital landscapes.
  CESP&#x27;s long-term vision is bold and inspiring: a connected, 
accessible shoreline of open space and parkland stretching from the 
Carquinez Strait to San Jose. Their work has created a legacy of 
preservation, environmental stewardship, and public access that will 
benefit generations to come.
  On behalf of the constituents of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional 
District, I commend Citizens for East Shore Parks for their outstanding 
contributions to our region and our environment, and I congratulate 
them on 40 years of remarkable achievement.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 3, 2025

  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate Bryan Sakuma&#x27;s service as Chair of the U.S. Highbush 
Blueberry Council (USHBC).
  Born and raised on the Sakuma family farm in Washington State, Bryan 
proudly represents the third generation of his family in the 
agriculture industry. From an early age, Bryan demonstrated a deep 
devotion to agriculture, spending weekends during his college years 
working the fields alongside his father and uncles while earning a 
degree in Agricultural Economics from Washington State University. He 
went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree from WSU in 1980 and is a 
distinguished alumnus of the Washington Agriculture &amp; Forestry 
Leadership Program, Class 12.
  Following graduation, Bryan joined the family business full-time, 
operating a nursery. By 1998, he became President of Sakuma Bros. 
Processing, Inc., where he led fresh and IQF processing operations and 
expanded the company&#x27;s Japanese export program. Since 2016, he has 
served as Vice President of Sales and Marketing, continuing to lead 
with the same dedication, integrity, and strategic vision.
  Throughout his professional life, Bryan has exemplified leadership 
and service. In addition to his recent tenure as Chair of the U.S. 
Highbush Blueberry Council, he has served as

[[Page E929]]

Chair of both the Washington Blueberry Commission and the Washington 
Red Raspberry Commission. He has also contributed his expertise as a 
member of the Washington State Commission on Pesticide Registration and 
the Washington State Strawberry Commission, among numerous other roles.
  Bryan Sakuma&#x27;s work has had a profound and lasting impact not only on 
the Pacific Northwest but on berry growers and agricultural communities 
nationwide. He has been a tireless advocate for growers, working to 
strengthen markets, support research, and promote the health and 
sustainability of the industry.
  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Mr. Sakuma&#x27;s greatest pride 
is his family. He is a devoted husband to his wife, Barbara, and a 
loving father and grandfather. Two of his sons, Nathan and Noel, have 
continued the Sakuma tradition of stewardship, innovation, and service 
to the community.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to commend Bryan Sakuma for his 
outstanding leadership, his dedication to American agriculture, and the 
enduring legacy he has helped to cultivate. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in expressing our deepest gratitude for his service.

  Mr. HARIDOPOLOS. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the life and legacy 
of John J. Meyers, III, a decorated veteran of the United States Navy 
who passed away on September 14, 2025, at the age of 87 in Sarasota, 
Florida.
  John answered the call to serve his country as a naval aviator. He 
trained in Pensacola, flew with Squadron VS-34 aboard the USS Essex, 
and later served as an instructor pilot at NAS Meridian. His skill and 
leadership reflected the very best of our Nation&#x27;s military tradition.
  After his service, John carried those same values into civilian life. 
He built a respected career in aviation and financial services, 
retiring as a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch in Sarasota. But 
beyond his profession, he was known for his mentorship and kindness.
  John J. Meyers lived a life of honor, both in uniform and in his 
community. Today, we remember him not only for his service to our 
Nation but for the positive impact he left on those around him. May his 
memory be a blessing, and may his family find comfort in knowing his 
legacy of service will endure.

tireless champion of economic justice and workplace democracy. From his 
early days as a truck driver and founding member of Teamsters for a

empowering employees, and strengthening communities. His leadership 
extended beyond C2BE to the Michigan Center for Employee Ownership, 
Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Detroit Community Wealth Fund, where he 
shared his expertise and vision for a fairer, more just world.
  Mike believed deeply in the power of unions to transform lives, which 
was reflected in his lifelong advocacy and teaching. His legacy will 
continue to inspire all who fight for justice, equity, and workers 
rights. Our thoughts are with his wife Barbara Harvey.
  We extend our love to his wife, siblings, children, grandchildren,

                        Friday, October 3, 2025

  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate International 
Plasma Awareness Week, an annual campaign dedicated to raising 
awareness about the importance of source plasma collection, recognizing 
the valued contributions of donors, and increasing understanding about 
plasma protein therapies and the rare diseases they treat.
  As co-chair of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus and a member of 
the Congressional Plasma Caucus, this annual event, celebrated from 
October 6 to 10 this year, is close to my heart.
  For many people with rare diseases, plasma-derived therapies mean the 
difference between life and death, or between a life of diminished 
health and physical limitations and one filled with hope and 
possibility.
  For example, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare but serious 
neurological disorder that can lead to rapid muscle weakness and, in 
severe cases, paralysis. A related condition, Chronic Inflammatory 
Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), is characterized by ongoing nerve 
inflammation that can significantly impair mobility and quality of 
life. For both these conditions, immunoglobulins reduce inflammation, 
regulate the immune system, and help patients regain function. Most 
patients with CIDP require life-long treatment to manage their 
symptoms.
  In the case of primary immunodeficiencies, hemophilia, alpha-1 
antitrypsin deficiency, and other conditions, the body does not make 
important proteins, or those proteins are functionally damaged. These 
patients also rely on plasma-derived medicine to replace their programs 
and restore their health. In most cases, plasma-derived therapies are 
the only available treatment for these conditions. That is why it&#x27;s so 
important that we raise awareness of the importance of plasma-derived 
therapies this week, and work to improve access to these unique 
biologic products.
  I&#x27;m committed to working to ensure that every individual, regardless 
of how rare their disease may be, has access to the therapies they need 
to lead healthier, fuller lives.

               REMEMBERING MIGUEL ANGEL GARCIA-HERNANDEZ

                                  _____
                                 

                          HON. MARC A. VEASEY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 3, 2025

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply heartbroken over the loss of 
Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, who succumbed to his injuries following 
the horrific shooting at the Dallas ICE facility. Miguel was a husband, 
a father, and a hardworking man whose greatest joy was providing for 
and being present with his family. His death is an immeasurable tragedy 
that has left a lasting void for those who loved him most.
  My prayers and deepest condolences are with Miguel&#x27;s wife, Stephany 
Gauffeny, their four children, and the baby they were expecting, as 
they face this devastating loss. To lose a loved one under such violent 
circumstances is a burden no family should ever bear. His loved ones 
should know that they are not alone in their grief--our community 
mourns alongside them, and we extend every measure of compassion and 
support possible.
  We will always remember Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez as a 
hardworking father, husband, neighbor, and colleague. Today, we stand 
in solidarity with the Mexican community as we grieve this loss 
together, and we hold on to the hope that his memory will strengthen 
our resolve to bring an end to the epidemic of gun violence in our 
country.

                          HON. MARC A. VEASEY

                                of texas

                        Friday, October 3, 2025

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I am profoundly saddened by the 
heartbreaking loss of Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, whose life was tragically 
taken in the recent attack at the Dallas ICE facility. His death is a 
sobering reminder of the human toll that violence leaves behind and the 
fragility of life when communities are confronted with such senseless 
acts.
  At a time like this, my deepest condolences go out to Mr. Guzman-
Fuentes&#x27;s wife, Berenice Prieto, loved ones, and all who knew him. 
Their grief is immeasurable, and they deserve the comfort, compassion, 
and solidarity of their community as they endure this painful loss. My 
prayers are with them, and I hope they find strength in the love and 
memories they shared with Norlan.
  As a community, we must stand together to reject violence and embrace 
peace and humanity. Every life lost diminishes us all, and we honor 
Norlan&#x27;s memory by recommitting ourselves to building a safer, more 
compassionate future where gun violence must end. May his family be 
surrounded by support and healing in the difficult days ahead.

                      REMEMBERING WALTER GRAINGER

                                  _____
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 3, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Walter Grainger, a lifelong resident of Bakersfield, California, who 
passed away on Sunday, September 14, 2025, at the age of 99.
  In May 1944, just weeks after graduating from Kern County Union High 
School, later renamed Bakersfield High School, Walter enlisted in the 
United States Navy, where he served honorably during World War II. He 
and his four brothers together wore our Nation&#x27;s uniform in defense of 
freedom.
  After the conclusion of his military service, Walter dedicated his 
life to education and community. He taught at Bakersfield High School, 
Shafter High School, and North High School, where he chaired the 
Industrial Arts Department, before later working as a safety consultant 
for the school district. Beyond the classroom, Walter was a devoted 
husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and faithful member of 
First United Methodist Church.
  Even in his nineties, Walter continued to serve. He was instrumental 
in the design and construction of the Kern County World War II Veterans 
Memorial at Jastro Park. His vision and leadership helped shape one of 
the most beautiful veterans memorials in the West. Today, that memorial 
stands as a lasting tribute to all who served, including Walter and his 
brothers, whose names are engraved in granite for generations to see.
  Walter was a deeply respected member of the community, and when he 
spoke, people listened. He lived his life with humility, service, and 
quiet strength. His legacy is found not only in the memorial he helped 
build, but in the family he loved, the students he taught, and the 
community he served.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the 
remarkable life of Walter Grainger. May his memory serve as an 
inspiration to all of us, and may his family take comfort in knowing 
the profound and enduring impact he had on Bakersfield, Kern County, 
and our Nation.
