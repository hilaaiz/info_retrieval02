                                 ______

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate 
Mr. Jack Nance, Executive Director of the Carolinas Golf Association 
(CGA) after 32 years of dedicated service in this role.
  Jack is a proud North Carolina native, he was born and raised in 
Clinton, North Carolina and attended high school and college in our 
great state. Jack is an avid golfer and has been a huge fan of the 
sport ever since his college days where he played golf at Wake Forrest 
and even served as the assistant coach for the golf team following his 
graduation.
  Throughout his tenure at the CGA, Jack has seen the organization grow 
to over 700 affiliated clubs that represent over 200,000 members. We 
will always appreciate the dedication Jack has shown to ensuring that 
golfers in the Carolinas have a great sporting experience and North 
Carolina maintains its reputation of the best state for golf.
  Jack has worked for the CGA since 1984 and has served as a rules 
official, communications point of contact and a course rater, before 
finally serving as Executive Director, a position he has held since 
1992. Jack even qualified for the 1980 US Amateur as a player. Nobody 
knows our courses quite like Jack and we will certainly miss his unique 
perspective.
  We know Jack is looking forward to being able to spend more time with 
his wife DeAnn and his two daughters Caroline and Liza. While we are 
sad to see Jack go, we wish him and his family the best as he begins 
this new and exciting chapter in his life.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating Mr. Jack Nance on 
his well-earned retirement after 32 years of serving as the Executive 
Director for the CGA.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
retired, tenacious, and self-motivated U.S. Army veteran, Sgt. Garnett 
T. Franklin. Sgt. Franklin enjoyed a long career in serving and 
teaching.
  Garnett T. Franklin was born and raised in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. 
He graduated from JFK High School in Mound Bayou in 1969. After high 
school, he enlisted in the Army, dedicated over two decades to serving 
in the U.S. Army Active Duty as a construction engineer. His military 
service offered many opportunities to serve at various Army bases and 
stations, such as Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 
Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and Fort Benning, Georgia for Jump School. 
He also traveled to Japan, Korea, Belvoir, Germany, and participated in 
the Return of Forces to Europe. He retired at Fort Benning, Georgia in 
1993.
  After retiring, he relocated back to Mississippi and began teaching 
JROTC in Jackson Public Schools, Jackson, Mississippi, which included 
Murrah High and Lanier High School. Later, he returned to Belgium to 
join his family and worked with the Department of Defense in Washington 
State for 17 years as a fitness specialist at MWR.
  Upon returning home to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, he spends his time 
volunteering in the community and surrounding areas. He also volunteers 
with a male group of concerned citizens known as the Development 
Committee. This group started by cleaning up the grounds of a long-
standing local service station, cutting grass, pulling vines, and 
refurbishing an old neighborhood house. They also maintain the facility 
building and the Taborian Hospital grounds. Now known as the unofficial 
``beautification committee,&#x27;&#x27; this volunteer group takes pride in 
completing various projects around the city. As the holiday season 
approaches, they are preparing by putting up lights and decorations in 
the Milburn Crow Memorial Park and on the grounds of the Taborian 
Hospital for the entire city to visit and enjoy.
  Volunteering in his hometown allows him to give back to the community 
and enjoy the pleasures of retired life. Sgt. Franklin firmly believes 
that the military offers valuable pathways to personal and professional 
growth. His life&#x27;s path has shown that the military is a great career 
starter.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Sgt. 
Garnett T. Franklin for his passion for leadership, service and 
volunteerism to the United States of America.

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the service of Mr. 
Steve E. Landin of Laredo, Texas. A lifelong civil servant, Mr. Landin 
has dedicated his career to the people of South Texas.
  He began his career with the City of Laredo in April 1990 and

Administration.

Landin served as Fire Chief and Emergency Management Coordinator for 
twelve years.
  He retired from the city in May 2020 and joined Webb County to serve 
as Emergency Management Coordinator for two years.
  Then, in August 2022, Mr. Landin rejoined the City of Laredo to serve 
as Assistant City Manager and Acting Chief of Police. In his role as an 
Assistant City Manager, he oversees more than ten different departments

Patrick Catholic Church in Laredo.
  Mr. Speaker, let us all dedicate ourselves to public service just as

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shanelle 
Scales-Preston for her decades of service to the House of 
Representatives as she departs to begin her new role as a Contra Costa 
County Supervisor.
  Shanelle has lived in and served the East Bay of California her whole 
life. After graduating from California State University East Bay, 
Shanelle worked for Contra Costa County and joined then-Congressman 
George Miller&#x27;s staff, working diligently on behalf of district 
residents for more than ten years. When Congressman Miller retired, I 
was thrilled to welcome her onto our office&#x27;s team. She has served as 
my District Director since 2015, helping lead our efforts in the 
district to provide outstanding service to constituents.
  Shanelle has also shown unwavering devotion to her hometown of 
Pittsburg, California where she resides with her husband, Damon, and 
their sons Jaden and Ashton. She has served on Pittsburg City Council 
since 2018, working tirelessly to foster a strong and diverse community 
throughout the City. In this role, she has spearheaded efforts to 
expand access to affordable housing, improve public transportation, 
empower Pittsburg&#x27;s youth, and build a vibrant hub in downtown 
Pittsburg. She has been a regional leader, working with a number of key 
groups and agencies, serving as the Chair of MCE and TransPlan and 
President of the League of California Cities East Bay Division. On top 
of it all, Shanelle is active with several community groups including 
the Gateway Rotary Club and Pittsburg Reads initiative.
  Shanelle was chosen by the voters to serve as the next Contra Costa 
County Supervisor for District 5. While I am sad to see her go from our 
team, I&#x27;m confident that in this role, she will continue to be an 
effective leader for our County. It has been a joy to work with 
Shanelle throughout the years and I&#x27;m incredibly grateful for her 
service.

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. LOPEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Wellington High 
School football team for making it to the Colorado 2A State 
Championship game in only their third season with a record of 10-3. The 
town of roughly 12,000 residents last had a High School between 1926 
and 1964. Wellington Middle-High School opened in August of 2022, 
choosing to honor the previous school&#x27;s colors and mascot, the Eagles.
  The combination of the players&#x27; determination and their coaches&#x27; 
admirable leadership throughout their playoff run culminated into a 
remarkable season. They are great examples of the extraordinary 
potential of the young people of Colorado.
  I thank the players for setting an example that will serve as an 
inspiration for future generations of high school athletes. They should 
all be extremely proud of what they have accomplished and know that 
this is just a precursor for the many great achievements each of them 
will have in their lifetimes.

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;m honored to recognize the Bishop McDevitt 
Crusaders on their incredible State Football Championship victory on 
December 6, 2024.
  The Crusaders prevailed in hard-fought overtime against the Roman 
Catholic Cahillites at Cumberland Valley&#x27;s Chapman Field. Crusaders&#x27; 
head coach Jeff Weachter and Quarterback Stone Saunders--bolstered by 
the Team&#x27;s incredible endurance, discipline, focus, and skill--led the 
Team to their monumental victory.
  After the Crusaders were leading 14-3 at halftime, the Cahillites 
rallied to take the lead by 31-28 with just under 6 minutes left in the 
fourth quarter. The Crusaders then tied the game with a field goal 
before making a critical defensive stop and sending the game into 
overtime. After halting the Cahillites&#x27; offense one last time, the 
Crusaders found their way again into field goal position, where Kicker 
Aidan Grella solidified the Crusaders&#x27; championship--their second in 
only three years.
  Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;m honored and privileged to recognize the Bishop 
McDevitt Crusaders Football Team on yet another State Championship 
victory, and wish them Godspeed in their individual and Team 
aspirations.

Caroline quickly stood out as an invaluable asset to the team. She 
envelopes and promotes Radical Hospitality, which made hiring her as 
Staff Assistant an easy choice. As a self-proclaimed animal lover, she 
took it upon herself to write a letter to the Smithsonian Zoo and 
Conservation Biology Institute about the future of the Giant Panda 
Program when its future was still an open question. This year Caroline 
was promoted to Legislative Aide, a position in which she has thrived, 
introducing multiple pieces of priority legislation including the Voter 
Choice Act and the Porch Pirates Act. She proudly embodies the 
Minnesota spirit and greets all who come to meet with her with warmth 
and a friendly smile.
  Staff and constituents alike know that Caroline is here for all the 
right reasons and is a tireless advocate for those without a platform. 
She&#x27;s a pleasure to work with and our senior staff members certainly 
appreciated her keeping them updated on all the latest memes and pop 
culture trends. As an avid watcher of The West Wing, Caroline reflects 
that same good faith and passion in everything she does. Watching her 
grow from an intern to an accomplished legislative staffer has been an 
absolute joy.
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. I 
wish Caroline all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for 
two years of faithful service to this Nation--and many more to come.

RECOGNIZING MY STAFF ASSISTANT/LEGISLATIVE CORRESPONDENT, ERIN DAILEY, 
  FOR HER EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA&#x27;S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL 
                                DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEAN PHILLIPS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Staff 
Assistant/Legislative Correspondent, Erin Dailey, for her work on 
behalf of every constituent in Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional 
District. I could not be more proud or grateful for her service.
  Although she was born in Wisconsin, Erin was raised in Minnesota&#x27;s 
Third Congressional District. After graduating from Armstrong High 
School, she attended Wesleyan University, where she played varsity 
soccer and received her degree in Government with a minor in Economics 
in 2023. Her experience studying abroad in Amman, Jordan, cemented her 
goal to move to Washington, D.C. after graduation and work in the 
public sector.
  After interning for my office in the fall of 2023, she returned full 
time as my Staff Assistant in February of 2024. Being a constituent 
herself, Erin has been a natural at making visitors to our office feel 
right at home when they walk through the front door. From organizing 
Donuts with Dean to assisting with D.C. tours, Erin has been a critical 
part of my mission of Radical Hospitality. Her recent promotion to 
Staff Assistant/Legislative Correspondent was an easy decision, as she 
has always been happy to handle constituent communications, even during 
the most challenging times in our office.
  Erin has been an amazing Staff Assistant that always keeps the trains 
running on time. She is full of life, vitality and positive energy. She 
is always looking to help the team and constituents make the best of 
their time in D.C. She practices the ethos of Radical Hospitality 
regularly to whoever she may meet. She always is learning and growing 
to broaden and develop her skill set even more. Hiring Erin was one of 
the best decisions we&#x27;ve made. As our final D.C. Staff Assistant, she 
is proof that sometimes the best is saved for last.
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. I 
wish Erin all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for her 
year of faithful service to this Nation.

  RECOGNIZING THE 18TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY&#x27;S OFFICE OF COLORADO

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JASON CROW

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of the 18th 
Judicial District Attorney&#x27;s Office of Colorado, led currently by 
District Attorney John Kellner, and serving Arapahoe, Douglas, Elbert, 
and Lincoln Counties.
  In January 1962, the 18th Judicial District was established. 
Initially comprised of Arapahoe and Douglas Counties, Elbert County was 
added in 1965, followed by Lincoln County in 1969.
  The 18th Judicial District, with a geographic size larger than the 
state of Connecticut, has grown more than any other Colorado judicial 
district during that time and now has a population exceeding one 
million people. Within the next decade, Arapahoe County&#x27;s population is 
expected to grow to be the most populous county in the state.
  In 2020, the Colorado General Assembly established a new judicial 
district. Next year, Douglas, Elbert and Lincoln Counties will form a 
newly created 23rd Judicial District, while Arapahoe County will be the 
sole county in the existing 18th Judicial District.
  Officials of the 18th Judicial District--prosecutors, victim witness 
specialists, support staff, and law enforcement officers--work hard 
every day to pursue justice, advocate for victims and support our 
community. As a Member of Congress, I look forward to continuing to 
work with our local law enforcement officials to promote public safety.

              RECOGNIZING THE LAREDO DAYBREAK ROTARY CLUB

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. HENRY CUELLAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 11, 2024

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor forty years of the 
Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club. Their civic and community engagement has 
been a force in south Texas for decades, and I cannot wait to see what 
they can accomplish in the future.
  Founded in 1984, the Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club has kept a keen 
focus on the healthcare of the community. And that focus has produced 
incredible results.
  The club&#x27;s first major initiative, helping Rotary International 
eradicate polio, raised more than 100 percent of their chapter goal. 
They then raised $125,000 to establish aerobic exercise courts on 
several school campuses across the district.
  Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club also put on annual screenings for 
glaucoma and assisted with Shots Across Texas. In districts like mine, 
such work is extremely important in promoting a healthy community. They 
are also involved in international health projects like building a 
clinic in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. I applaud them for it.
  I also want to take note of perhaps one of their greatest 
accomplishments. The Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club has presented $100,000 
for the endowment of Texas A&amp;M International University and another 
$100,000 for Laredo Community College.
  These funds, which were raised by an annual raffle originally started 
to help eradicate

[[Page E1262]]

polio, are integral in promoting higher education in south Texas.
  The club also presents $1,000 scholarships each year to a graduating 
student from all eight of Laredo&#x27;s high schools.
  Mr. Speaker, Laredo has been forever changed by the incredible work 
of our local Rotary organization. It&#x27;s been an inspiring four decades: 
I look forward to their continued work in the local community.
