 CELEBRATING THE 50 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNITY RESIDENCES INC. (CRi)

                                  _____
                                 

                        HON. JAMES R. WALKINSHAW

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Community 
Residences Inc. on the occasion of their 50th anniversary.
  For half a century, this remarkable organization has stood at the 
forefront of the movement to expand opportunity, ensure dignity, and 
promote independence for individuals with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities in Northern Virginia.
  What began in 1975 as a grassroots response to the lack of community-
based housing for people with disabilities has grown into one of the 
region&#x27;s most respected providers of inclusive services. In its 
earliest days, CRi, then Arlington Community Residences, challenged 
outdated models of institutionalization by creating homes where 
individuals could thrive as valued members of their neighborhoods. Over 
the decades, the organization evolved, broadening its programs and 
reaffirming its mission in a new name Community Residences Inc, with 
the tagline, choice, respect, and independence; that reflects the core 
principles guiding their work.
  As the organization celebrates 50 years of service, it also looks 
forward to the launch of its Champions Campaign: a bold initiative to 
secure the resources needed to expand housing, enrich community 
programs, and prepare the next generation of advocates. The campaign is 
not only an investment in facilities and services, but in the vision 
that every individual deserves the right to self-determination, 
belonging, and a life of purpose.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing CRi for 50 
years of leadership, compassion, and impact. Their history is a 
testament to the power of community action, and their future promises 
to carry forward the values of choice, respect, and independence for 
generations to come.

 HONORING CHRISTOPHER FEARON AS A DISTINGUISHED FIRST RESPONDER LEADER 
                           IN CENTRAL FLORIDA

                                  _____
                                 

                            HON. DARREN SOTO

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, earlier this summer in Altamonte Springs, 
while off-duty and spending time with his family, Firefighter and 
Paramedic Christopher Fearon witnessed a five-year-old boy slip under 
the water and begin to drown. Within seconds, he pulled the child out, 
cleared his airway, and helped him take a lifesaving breath. The boy 
was purple in the face and struggling to breathe, but thanks to Chris&#x27;s 
training, instinct, and calm under pressure, he survived and recovered.
  Chris embodies: Skill and decisiveness under pressure--drawing on 
years of fire-rescue and paramedic training; Service beyond duty--never 
hesitating to act, even off the clock; Humility and compassion--later 
reflecting, ``All I wanted to do since I was little was help people . . 
. and I love it.&#x27;&#x27; This act of quick thinking heroism, covered by local 
news, not only saved a life but also drew attention to the importance 
of water safety in Central Florida. The boy has since received a 
scholarship to learn to swim, creating a ripple effect of safety and 
prevention beyond the incident itself.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the career and legacy of La 
Shelle Dozier as she retires from her position as executive director of 
the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency (SHRA), where she has 
served my constituents for over twenty-three years. I ask all of my 
colleagues to join me to acknowledge her distinguished career.
  Since first joining SHRA in 2002, La Shelle has been integral to the 
agency&#x27;s operations and has had a transformative effect on affordable 
housing opportunities in Sacramento. Starting as a management analyst, 
La Shelle quickly learned every facet of the Sacramento housing 
industry. She rose very quickly to managing the transformation of South 
Sacramento&#x27;s Franklin Villa into the 360-unit Phoenix Park. She also 
directed resident services and oversaw the Housing Choice Voucher 
program that today supports more than 13,000 of my constituents with up 
to 100 percent of their rent needs.
  La Shelle formally took leadership of SHRA in 2008, where she 
successfully pushed the agency to transform legacy projects into model 
affordable housing developments that continue to inspire communities 
across the country to

[[Page E936]]

do more to address the housing crisis. In 2012, I worked with La Shelle 
and SHRA to secure a $300,000 planning grant to begin the process of 
redeveloping the Twin Rivers public housing project, now called Marisol 
Village, an affordable housing project. Thirteen years of partnership 
later, and after securing over $32 million in federal funding, Marisol 
Village is now double its original size at 427 units. Most importantly 
the community now provides my constituents with vital resources, like a 
full suite of resident services, green space, childcare facilities, a 
light rail station and cultural amenities, right at their doorstep. I 
am proud to have worked with La Shelle to create real positive impact 
with Sacramento&#x27;s federal tax dollars right here in our community.
  La Shelle Dozier&#x27;s tenure at SHRA is a shining example of what makes 
Sacramento special. La Shelle knows firsthand that often it takes a 
village to build a village. Time and time again I have joined La Shelle 
in support of SHRA&#x27;s projects and witnessed her build a wide coalition 
of local, state and federal partners to bring a safe and healthy home 
to those who need it most. The work that La Shelle and her team have 
done is truly indicative of why I love our region. Here in Sacramento, 
we lift up our community and seek to create positive and lasting 
impacts for all Sacramentans.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the career 
and legacy of the SHRA Executive Director, La Shelle Dozier.

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia 
Clemency Home Rule Act, which would give the District of Columbia 
exclusive authority to grant clemency for D.C. crimes. Currently, the 
president exercises the authority to grant clemency for D.C.

[[Page E935]]

crimes, though presidents rarely do so. D.C. residents deserve a say in 
whether their fellow residents deserve mercy. In the 117th Congress, 
the House Committee on Oversight and Reform passed this bill as part of 
the District of Columbia Home Rule Expansion Act of 2022 (H.R. 8861).
  While D.C. law appears to give the mayor authority to grant clemency 
for certain D.C. crimes (D.C. Code 1-301.76), under current practice, 
clemency petitions for D.C. crimes, like federal crimes, are submitted 
to the Department of Justice for the president&#x27;s consideration.
  The states and territories have full control over their criminal 
justice systems, including clemency. D.C. also should have full control 
over its criminal justice system. Since the D.C. Council has authority 
to enact local D.C. laws, D.C. officials are in the best position to 
grant clemency for D.C. crimes. This bill would give D.C. authority to 
use any type of clemency system.
  This bill is an important step in expanding D.C. home rule. I urge my 
colleagues to support it.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT COLONEL JABAR SHABAZZ ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lt. Colonel Jabar 
Shabazz, who is retiring after 31 years of faithful service to our 
Nation, culminating in his service as lieutenant colonel, the highest 
rank in the Sheriff&#x27;s Office, immediately below Sheriff.
  Lt. Col. Shabazz has always been a competitive and driven person, as 
was apparent in his days as a college basketball player. He attended 
Virginia State University on a four-year athletic scholarship and 
played small forward. In his senior year, his team won the Central 
Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship. While his goal was 
to join the NBA, Shabazz ended up meeting several folks who worked for 
the Richmond Sheriff&#x27;s Office when he was playing in a summer league 
after college.
  He began his career in public service in 1989 when he joined the 
Richmond Sheriff&#x27;s Office. After five years of distinguished service in 
Richmond, Lt. Col. Shabazz decided to join the Fairfax County Sheriff&#x27;s 
Office in March of 1994 after taking a tour of the Adult Detention 
Center (ADC) and liking what he saw.
  Since his graduation from the Fairfax County Criminal Justice 
Academy, he has spent the majority of his career in the ADC but has 
served with distinction in all areas of the agency, including court 
security and internal affairs. Throughout his time in each division and 
rank, Lt. Col. Shabazz made his mark on his colleagues and the Fairfax 
County Sheriff Stacey Kincaid. Sheriff Kincaid ended up offering 
Shabazz the position to serve as her Chief Deputy in 2022, despite his 
nearing retirement. Knowing he had more service to give, he accepted 
and obtained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
  When taking over the position of Chief Deputy of Operations, Shabazz 
was confident in his skills in operations and was looking forward to 
being responsible for both the ADC and all of their support services. 
Sheriff Kincaid described him as being ``the gold standard of 
leadership in [the] agency,&#x27;&#x27; and that he ``brings with him a mentality 
of getting to yes and finding a way over, around, or through any 
obstacle to get the job done.&#x27;&#x27; His appointment to this position was 
also historic, as he became the first African American Lieutenant 
Colonel and Chief Deputy.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lt. 
Colonel Jabar Shabazz on his retirement. On behalf of myself and the 
citizens of Fairfax County, I thank him and his family for his 
honorable 31 years of selfless service to our Nation. Fairfax County is 
the safest jurisdiction of its size, and that is in no small part due 
to the dedication of individuals like Lt. Col. Shabazz. Best wishes for 
a safe and happy retirement.

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing October as National Spine Health Awareness 
Month.
  In the U.S., 100 million people suffer from neck or back conditions 
every year according to the CDC. Back pain is the number one cause of 
missed workdays, the leading cause of job-related disability and pain 
in the U.S., and the most common non-cancer related reason for an 
opioid prescription in the U.S. In addition, those with back and neck 
pain are four times more likely to become clinically depressed.
  The National Spine Health Foundation, located in my district in 
Reston, Virginia, is the only national patient-centered non-profit 
dedicated to helping patients overcome debilitating spinal conditions 
and take back their lives. For over two decades, the Foundation has 
increased its commitment to and has developed award winning patient 
education, advocacy, and research work to give patients the tools they 
need to make informed decisions about their spine health and navigate 
their own treatment journeys with confidence.
  To further address the complex challenges of spinal health, the 
Foundation has created four specialized task forces led by experts in 
their fields.
  The Opioid Task Force which has advanced research on minimizing 
opioid use while still optimizing pain relief.
  The Bone Health Task Force promotes bone health screening protocols, 
research, and public education.
  The Military &amp; Veterans Task Force works to ensure that service 
members and veterans receive advanced, appropriate spine care.
  Finally, the Motion Preservation Task Force ensures patients and 
providers have access to lifechanging motion-preserving procedures, 
focusing on artificial disc replacement.
  The Foundation continues to be strongly committed to spine health 
research. Patient reported outcomes have long been part of fabric of 
NSHF since its inception. As they are deeply invested in supporting 
evidence-based healthcare decisionmaking, it is important to be part of 
the process of creating the evidence. Their cloud-based research tool 
called `Spine-online&#x27; enables them to conduct multi-center studies and 
partner with research teams both in the U.S. and internationally. 
Active studies are currently occurring on robotic surgery, enhanced 
surgical recovery, augmented reality, a genetic basis for personalized 
spine treatments, stem cell therapy, and more.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the 
importance of good spinal health and thanking the NSHF and the 
healthcare providers who help spine and neck patients, not just in 
October, but all year long.

  RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. MARY&#x27;S EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN 
                            LAMPASAS, TEXAS

                          HON. AUGUST PFLUGER

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 
150th anniversary of St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Lampasas, Texas.
  Founded in 1873 during the turbulent years of Reconstruction, St. 
Mary&#x27;s has stood as a steadfast place of worship and community for a 
century and a half. From its beginnings under the leadership of Dr. 
Thomas S. Denny and a small group of faithful families, the church 
persevered through frontier hardships, local feuds, floods, and 
economic trials. Over the years, it has grown into a vibrant 
congregation rooted in service, tradition, and faith.
  The sanctuary itself, built of native limestone in the Victorian 
Gothic style, is a testament to the perseverance of its early leaders, 
including Capt. A.H. Barnes, Dr. James Bierbower, W.T. Campbell, T.H. 
Haynie, W.C. Price, and others whose dedication made possible the 
construction of a permanent church home. Generations of families, like 
the Campbells, the Haynies, the Richeys, the Olivers, and many more 
have sustained and enriched the life of St. Mary&#x27;s across decades, 
ensuring its continued presence as a spiritual cornerstone of the 
Lampasas community.
  Today, St. Mary&#x27;s remains a thriving parish, carrying forward its 
mission with more than a dozen families whose membership stretches back 
multiple generations, while also welcoming new parishioners who bring 
fresh perspectives and energy. Together, this congregation embodies the 
resilience, stability, and continuity that have defined St. Mary&#x27;s 
since its founding.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. Mary&#x27;s 
Episcopal Church for 150 years of faithful service to its members, the 
people of Lampasas, and the greater Central Texas region. May the 
congregation continue to serve as a beacon of hope, light, and grace 
for generations to come.

   RECOGNIZING THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF MERRIFIELD ON THEIR 155TH 
                              ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Mr. WALKINSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the First Baptist 
Church of Merrifield on the occasion of the 155th anniversary of its 
sanctuary. For more than a century and a half, First Baptist Church of 
Merrifield has served as a cornerstone of faith, service, and community 
for the Northern Virginia region. First Baptist Church of Merrifield 
was started in a log cabin between 1871 to 1872. FBCM had then branched 
out and began worshipping on property owned by Mr. Robert Bradley of 
Merrifield. In 1891, the property was purchased from him by church 
Trustees: John E. Coates, Joshua Ball, and Joshua Pearson for the sum 
of five dollars. FBCM is a church formed from strong community family 
ties and has remained steadfastly community focused since.
  FBCM remains a vital part of our district today by partnering with 
neighbors and local organizations to fulfill local needs through 
service projects, food and supply drives, youth programs, and many 
other community-centered initiatives. Through these efforts, FBCM 
continues to foster a spirit of faith, service, collaboration, and 
compassion throughout our district.
  Over the past 155 years, FBCM has been led by 13 pastors and 2 
interim pastors. Each one contributing to the growth of FBCM and 
leaving behind their own unique legacy of service. A few of those 
contributions include: the establishment of the Golden Ages Senior 
Saints Ministry, the construction of the Merrifield Child Development 
Center, the recovery of the original church bell, the creation of a 
youth mentoring program with Luther Jackson Middle School, the 
development of a tutoring outreach program targeting local students, 
and much more. FBCM and its congregation lead by faith and example in 
our community.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending First 
Baptist Church of Merrifield for its efforts to better the Northern 
Virginia region. Achieving 155 years of ministry is a milestone worth 
celebrating. It is a privilege to work alongside this great 
congregation in the community, and I wish them continued success 
through faith, family, and service.

     RECOGNIZING THE TOMBIGBEE ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE&#x27;S ACHIEVEMENTS

                                  _____
                                 

                        HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 6, 2025

  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the completion 
of Tombigbee Electric Cooperative&#x27;s commitment to bring reliable, high-
speed fiber internet access to more than 100,000 residents in Northwest 
Alabama.
  Tombigbee Electric Cooperative was established to meet the need for 
electricity among citizens in the rural areas of Northwest Alabama. 
Since its founding in 1941, Tombigbee has demonstrated an unwavering 
dedication to serving its community and strengthening the area it 
surrounds. Over the decades, the cooperative has provided safe and 
provide safe and reliable electric power and fiber-to-the-home 
internet.
  In 2017, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative set forth an ambitious goal 
to provide high-quality, high-speed internet service to 100,000 people 
across Northwest Alabama. Today, that goal has been achieved.
  Through the installation of more than 4,200 miles of fiber and a 
total investment of $145 million, made possible by $37 million in state 
and federal grants, as well as a $100 million investment by the 
cooperative itself, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has delivered on its 
promise to bridge the digital divide for rural Alabamians.
  Mr. Speaker, this milestone represents more than the completion of a 
project, it signifies a lasting investment in the prosperity and 
potential of rural communities. Thousands of citizens will now reap the 
benefits of this achievement, including expanded educational 
opportunities, strengthened economic development, improved access to 
health care, and an enhanced quality of life for countless families and 
businesses.
  Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has demonstrated that when vision, 
leadership, and commitment to community are combined, meaningful 
progress can be made.
  This accomplishment serves as a reminder that rural America must 
never be left behind. I commend Tombigbee Electric Cooperative for its 
steadfast dedication and leadership, and I look forward to seeing the 
continued benefits this investment will bring to the people of 
Northwest Alabama.
