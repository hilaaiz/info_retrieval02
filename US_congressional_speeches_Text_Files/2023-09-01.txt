          CELEBRATING REVEREND DOCTOR CHARLES EDWARD MCCOLLUM

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DONALD G. DAVIS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 1, 2023

  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
pay tribute to a visionary, dynamic, and God-fearing Pastor who has 
served Halifax County, North Carolina, for 50 years.
  Since 1973, when he was licensed to preach, Rev. Dr. Charles Edward 
McCollum has immersed himself in teaching and preaching the powerful 
word of God to countless individuals.
  For nearly 50 years, Rev. Dr. McCollum has been the Senior Pastor of 
Oak Grove PromiseLand Ministries in Littleton and Piney Grove Baptist 
Church in Halifax. During his pastorate, these churches have grown 
spiritually and numerically.
  Beyond church leadership, Rev. Dr. McCollum&#x27;s impact on the greater 
community has been significant. He served as Executive Director of the 
Halifax County Black Caucus. Under his guidance, the Caucus achieved 
substantial milestones in education and civic engagement.
  In addition, his dedication to education has been exemplary, 
evidenced by his unselfish service on the Halifax County Board of 
Education, 2 earned doctorate degrees, and the establishment in 1991 of 
Eastern Carolina Christian College in Roanoke Rapids, NC.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Rev. Dr. McCollum&#x27;s decades of service in 
adult corrections. He made a lasting difference as an educator in the 
Virginia Department of Corrections, helping inmates improve their 
literacy skills and prepare for re-entry into society. While serving as 
a transition specialist for the Department, he wrote many project plans 
that are now part of the correctional program, notably the Straight 
Project.
  In 1984, Rev. Dr. McCollum&#x27;s advocacy led to changes in employment 
practices at courthouse offices in Halifax County, where the offices 
employed a more diverse workforce. That same year, he and 18 other 
plaintiffs prevailed in a lawsuit that changed the method of electing 
county commissioners from an at-large voting system to a district 
system, thus enabling African Americans to elect commissioners of their 
choice.
  In 2016, Rev. Dr. McCollum led the effort to get the supplemental tax 
on the ballot in Halifax County, which later passed, and the revenue 
reinvested into the community. The additional funding from it bridged 
the gap between state funding and what was needed for the Halifax 
County Schools to operate efficiently. Some outcomes included hiring 
teachers and support staff and purchasing new curriculum materials, 
activity buses, athletic uniforms and supplies, playground equipment, 
and technology upgrades. His advocacy also led to the recognition of 
Sarah Keys Evans as a civil rights trailblazer and the creation of the 
Sarah Keys Evans Plaza in Roanoke Rapids, NC.
  Rev. Dr. McCollum has aired a weekly radio show called Real Talk on 
WMCY in Roanoke Rapids. The show exposed police brutality, the drug 
epidemic, environmental justice, and the existence of coal ash in 
Halifax County.
  Rev. Dr. Charles Edward McCollum&#x27;s life has been 1 of selflessness, 
leadership, and profound impact. I join the chorus of others in 
celebrating him for his outstanding contributions to the citizens of 
Halifax County, the First Congressional District of North Carolina, and 
the Nation. I eagerly anticipate his continued positive influence in 
the years ahead.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 1, 2023

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today I want to celebrate the legacy of our 
nation&#x27;s Rosie the Riveters in recognition of the dedication of the 
Rosie the Riveter Rose Garden in Garden City.
  During World War II countless women from across the nation and right 
here in Southeast Michigan took over jobs that had been previously 
performed by men. Three hundred thousand Rosie the Riveters held our 
country down during extremely trying times and became icons of women&#x27;s 
empowerment and strength. This Labor Day, I am proud to recognize these 
women who blazed the trail for women in the workforce and for their 
contributions to the labor movement and our history.
  As we gather to ring a bell for Rosie, please join me and the people 
of Garden City in Michigan&#x27;s 12th District Strong as we honor their 
legacy with the dedication of the Rosie the Riveter Rose Garden.

                          ____________________

State football games as often as possible.

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Scott 
MacLeod upon his retirement as an English and Journalism teacher from 
San Marin High School. Scott dedicated more than 2 decades to educating 
and mentoring students.
  Earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy from Harvard, Scott

as Senior Vice President at J. Walter Thompson and DDB Worldwide. After 
a cancer diagnosis and recovery, Scott shifted career paths and entered 
public service, where he discovered his passion for education. He 
worked with at-risk youth in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San 
Francisco, California before becoming the Director of Development for 
Breakthrough Collaborative, a National nonprofit

He is married to Linda Kislingbury, a Drama teacher at San Marin High 
School.
  Scott MacLeod exemplifies what it means to be a public servant. Mr. 
Speaker, I respectfully ask that you join me in expressing gratitude to

               HONORING THE HEROIC ACTIONS OF RICO BRIGGS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 1, 2023

  Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and recognize 
the extraordinary bravery and quick thinking of a precious young man, 
Mr. Rico Briggs of Bluff City, Tennessee.
  On the morning of August 20th, at just 4 years old, Rico found 
himself in a critical situation that would test the limits of his 
courage and maturity. At approximately 6:15 a.m., a structure fire 
began at 4988 Bluff City Hwy. When emergency responders arrived at the 
scene, they found residents of the apartment building outside, 
clutching their possessions, with smoke rising from the building.
  Upon further investigation, it was discovered that it was Rico Briggs 
who, upon seeing smoke in his own room, promptly alerted his mother, 
Ms. Moriah Briggs. Despite the overwhelming fear and chaos such a 
situation would induce, Rico&#x27;s swift actions ensured that his mother 
could notify all the tenants in the building&#x27;s other apartments, 
allowing them to safely evacuate. Their escape was particularly crucial 
given the failure of the building&#x27;s smoke alarm.
  It is no exaggeration to state that the actions of Rico Briggs were 
lifesaving. Without his immediate response, the outcome could have been 
gravely different. Such valor and presence of mind in a child so young 
are truly exceptional and worthy of the highest commendation.
  Moreover, in acknowledgment of Rico&#x27;s heroic act, the Town of Bluff 
City has proclaimed August 26th as ``Rico Briggs Day,&#x27;&#x27; as a testament 
to the profound impact of his actions on our community. On this day, 
every year, we will be reminded not only of the bravery exhibited by 
this young boy, but also of the importance of looking out for one 
another and the strength that lies in community bonds. It is sincerely 
my hope that as we celebrate Rico Briggs Day annually, it will inspire 
others, young and old alike, to act with the same courage and 
selflessness in times of crisis.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the courage of Rico 
Briggs. His actions are a testament to the spirit of our community in 
Tennessee and the values instilled in our youth. Today, we celebrate 
Rico, and may we all be inspired by his courage and the profound impact 
1 individual can make, regardless of age.

  Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of a local hero, Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue Battalion Chief 
Terryson Jackson, who sadly passed away on August 28, 2023, in the line 
of duty.
  Battalion Chief Jackson proudly served the people of Broward County 
for 19 years. He began his fire rescue career in March 2004 in 
Deerfield Beach and joined the Broward Sheriffs Office (BSO) in October 
2011. Chief Jackson joined the Air Rescue 85 team as a flight

[[Page E807]]

medic in July 2013, and on February 24, 2016, he was promoted to 
Captain. Broward County has acted to posthumously promote Chief Jackson 
from the rank of Captain to the rank of Battalion Chief.
  As a flight paramedic, he impacted the community daily, providing 
critical patients with the highest prehospital care. He consistently 
showed an unmatched passion for the job. He always provided expert 
care, compassion, and reassurance to those during their most 
significant time of need. He is survived by his parents, son, daughter, 
and siblings.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in remembering the life and service of 
Chief Terryson Jackson. May his memory bless his family, friends, and 
the Broward County community to whom he dedicated his life in service.

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th 
birthday of Leona Yost, an incredible mother, grandmother, great-
grandmother, and Wisconsinite from Oconto.
  Leona Yost was born on July 28, 1923. She was the daughter of Herbert 
and Mary Whiting, and she grew up on their family farm. Leona graduated 
from Lena High School in the year 1941 and after her graduation, she 
worked at the egg factory in Oconto and later the Grant Store in Green 
Bay.
  In 1943, Leona married George Yost and they proceeded to work 
together on the George&#x27;s family farm in Lena. Leona and George welcomed 
five beautiful children who went on to bless them with seven 
grandchildren, and 17 great grandchildren. Leona is noted for having an 
amazing memory and a deep interest in coin collecting and coin 
history--she loves to share these passions with her grandchildren and 
great grandchildren. Potentially of most importance, she is known 
throughout Oconto for her delicious potato salad.
  Leona has always been an active member of the community. She was an 
Oconto County 4-H leader for 37 years working for the Meadow Brook 4-H 
club. She also worked for several years for the town of Stiles as an 
election poll worker. Leona is a truly selfless woman who has worked 
hard her entire life to give back to others. She has lived an 
incredible life and has now reached a very rare milestone.
  I would like to ask all my colleagues to join me in wishing Leona 
Yost happy 100th birthday.

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding constituent, from my district, Rev. B. Gomez. We are 
celebrating 100 years of his life. As a dedicated citizen and voter, of 
this wonderful country, as he publicly states, Rev. Gomez brings to us 
an extraordinary plethora of history that he has encountered. Rev. 
Gomez was born in Puerto Rico on September 3, 1923.
  He attended the University of Puerto Rico and after his graduation 
made a decision to dedicate his life to ministry and furthered his 
education at the Seminary of Puerto Rico. Once graduated he moved to 
New York City and married his wife, Efigenia Gomez in New York City on 
August 1, 1954. While his wife continued raising two daughters and 
furthering her education to achieve her Degree in Education, Rev. Gomez 
became pastor of The First Reformed Parish in New York City, later was 
transferred to Chicago and finally settled into a parish in 
Philadelphia. At this parish, Rev. Gomez along with his wife began a 
Senior Center, Lady Steppers Marching for Parades, an after school 
program, and with the

[[Page E808]]

assistance of volunteer dentists, a dental facility for the community 
was added onto the parish.
  He takes pride in his three grandchildren: Thomas, Ronald &amp; Daniela.
  After retirement and the passing of his wife, he moved to Bucks 
County in Fairless Hills, PA. Rev. Gomez has truly achieved much in his 
100 years of life, and we are appreciative for the dedication he has 
given throughout his years to the many lives he has touched with his 
ministry.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ANDY HARRIS

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 1, 2023

  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shiela D. Corley 
for receiving a 2023 University of Kentucky Alumni Association 
Distinguished Service Award. This prestigious award is presented to 
those who have provided extraordinary leadership, dedication, and have 
a history of diligently serving the UK alumni and community.
  Shiela grew up on a farm in the small town of Greenville, Kentucky. 
She followed her dream of attending the University of Kentucky, where 
she received both her bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. After graduate 
school, Shiela began her career with the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
as a dedicated public servant with the National Agricultural Statistics 
Service and later the Food and Nutrition Service. I am pleased that she 
is currently serving on a detail assignment from USDA to the House 
Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I chair.
  While living in Washington, D.C., Shiela has been an active member of 
the University of Kentucky&#x27;s Nation&#x27;s Capital Alumni Club, serving as 
vice president from 2004 through 2009. She currently serves on UK&#x27;s 
Alumni Leadership Advisory Council and is active in the Washington, 
D.C. community as a member of the Junior League and other non-profits, 
including the Kentucky Society of Washington.
  In 2017, Shiela and her family established the Corley Family 
Endowment in memory of her sister Shannon, who was also a UK alum and 
avid Wildcat fan alongside Shiela. The endowment provides support to a 
member of their hometown community to attend the University of 
Kentucky. To date, they have awarded five scholarships, with the first 
recipient graduating this past May. Through this endowment, Shiela and 
her family help others realize their dream of attending the University 
of Kentucky while also memorializing and celebrating the life and 
Wildcat spirit of Shannon.
  It is my distinct honor to recognize Shiela D. Corley for her 
outstanding servant leadership to the University of Kentucky, USDA, and 
as part of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee team.

          RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF BERT HUNTER LANE

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 1, 2023

  Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the life and service of World War I veteran and hero, Boy First Class, 
Bert Hunter Lane.
  Bert Hunter Lane was born July 29, 1895, in Madison, Suwannee County, 
Florida, before relocating with his family to Lakeland, Florida in 
1909. Lane attended Lakeland High School, where he made honor roll and 
played in the band.
  As a young adult, Lane was a driver for the Standard Oil Company and 
Gulf Refining Company and attended First Baptist Church of Lakeland. 
After World War I broke out in 1914, Lane moved to Tampa, FL to join 
the U.S. Coast Guard on April 8, 1917 at 21 years old. He was given the 
rank Boy First Class and placed under the command of Captain Charles 
Satterlee on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Tampa, one of six assigned to 
convoy duty in Europe.
  The Tampa, armed with three-inch guns, had successfully escorted 
eighteen convoys and earned a special commendation for exemplary 
service. On September 26, 1918, soon after her 19th convoy, Tampa was 
torpedoed by the German submarine UB-91. In just three minutes, Tampa 
sunk, claiming the lives of 130 in the single largest loss of life for 
the Coast Guard during World War I.
  In 1928, the United States Coast Guard Memorial was dedicated at 
Arlington National Cemetery, memorializing the 111 coast guardsmen lost 
that day. The Purple Heart was not yet authorized, but in 1999 
Commandant Admiral James Loy awarded the Coast Guardsmen posthumously 
for their brave actions.
  One hundred five years after Tampa was lost, and 24 years after the 
first Purple Heart was awarded to one of her crew, no relatives have 
been located to receive the honor on Lane&#x27;s behalf. Today, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring Bert--his heroism, his service and 
most importantly his sacrifice.

               RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF RANDY COATES, SR.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, September 1, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize 
the late Randy Coates, Sr. and his accomplishments as a public servant. 
A graduate of East High School in the early 1970s, he enjoyed 
tremendous success with the football and track &amp; field teams. Upon 
graduation, Randy joined the United States Army in 1975 and was 
stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.
  Randy discovered his passion for coaching basketball upon returning 
to Buffalo. He started coaching in the Randy Smith Summer Basketball 
League, coaching a team in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s divisions. He 
took pride in his teams, and strived to not only teach basketball, but 
life lessons, as well. He left youth basketball to become the head 
women&#x27;s basketball coach at Daemen College, and later an assistant 
coach at Hilbert College.
  After a successful college coaching career, Randy focused back on 
developing and mentoring children in the community. In 1990, Randy 
began his career at the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs Bailey-Doat. At the Boys &amp; 
Girls Club, Randy formed great relationships with local youth and 
created a basketball team that won several Randy Smith Summer 
Basketball League Championships. Following years of success, Mr. Coates 
went to work at the Masten Boys and Girls Club, where he would 
eventually become director. There, Randy continued to coach basketball, 
but also introduced both in house football leagues and video games, 
which he would often bring from home for the children to play.
  Randy encouraged these young men and women to achieve and sustain 
success. He would often note that the work they put into their craft is 
what they are going to get out of it. On this, the official Randy 
Coates Sr. Day in the City of Buffalo, I am delighted to honor his 
memory. His legacy is celebrated by his wife, Ronnell, his children, 
grandchildren, and countless grateful community members who have been 
inspired by Randy&#x27;s unwavering dedication to the betterment of Buffalo.
