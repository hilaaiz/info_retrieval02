       HONORING CITY OF MISSION VIEJO CITY MANAGER DENNIS WILBERG

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. YOUNG KIM

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 26, 2024

  Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Mission Viejo 
City Manager Dennis Wilberg for his decades of service to our Mission 
Viejo community and to Orange County.
  His work in the public and private sectors of civil and 
transportation engineering, including 20 years as City Manager, has 
left an enormous impact across Mission Viejo and the County.
  From helping create the second-largest animal shelter in Orange 
County and building a water treatment facility, to increasing public 
safety and maintaining the City&#x27;s transportation network, there&#x27;s no 
question how he has become the longest-tenured city manager in Orange 
County.
  I thank him for his dedication to keeping our communities safe and 
connected.
  We are grateful for his leadership, and I wish him a wonderful 
retirement.

                          ____________________

[[Page E780]]

Eshoo, Ro Khanna, and Jimmy Panetta to recognize the accomplishments of 
Teatro Vision for 40 years of community building and social justice 
work in San Jose, CA.
  Teatro Vision was founded in 1984 in San Jose, California, with the 
mission of inspiring the people of Santa Clara County and surrounding 
areas. The theater was co-founded by Elisa Marina Alvarado, who is a 
director, actress, and dancer. Through Teatro Vision, Elisa Marina 
Alvarado established Instituto de Teatro, an educational program that 
teaches comprehensive training in theater for Latino communities.
  For the last 40 years, Teatro Vision has produced and presented 
projects that have been made accessible to the entire community, 
emphasizing activist theater and focusing on Latino and Chicano 
communities, integrating Latin American cultures. Teatro Vision&#x27;s 
recent projects include ``Miss You Like Hell,&#x27;&#x27; ``Luz: A Shadow Play 
Inspired by Senior Stories,&#x27;&#x27; and ``Raices, El Libro de los Caminos,&#x27;&#x27; 
performed at the Mexican Heritage Plaza in San Jose.
  Teatro Vision&#x27;s work is centered in the Mayfair neighborhood located 
in East San Jose where their main stage, the Mexican Heritage Plaza, is 
also situated. Over 77 percent of the Mayfair neighborhood is made up 
of Latinx; 66 percent of which speak Spanish at home. Teatro Vision&#x27;s 
programs give accessibility to Title I schools in Mayfair, where many 
students come from economically disadvantaged households.
  Teatro Vision has shared powerful stories and convictions that speak 
to the courage, compassion, and power of many minority communities. The 
team at Teatro Vision are strong leaders that our community needs now 
and in the future.

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Anna Osinski 
Perrong, a remarkable constituent from my district, who is celebrating 
her 100th birthday. Anna was born on July 27, 1924, in Sellersville, 
Pennsylvania. She graduated from Girls High School in 1941 and 
continued with her undergraduate degree at Temple University School of 
Pharmacy where she met her future husband, John Pierce Perrong. She 
graduated from Temple University in 1944.
  She participated in numerous (Rho Psi) sorority functions during her 
years at Temple University. Anna and John were married after he 
returned from World War II, where he served as an Army medic in 
Germany. Anna started her career at Dupont as a chemist and later 
worked at Sharp &amp; Dohme as a research chemist.
  Anna and John moved into their new home in Northeast Philadelphia in 
1950. They were blessed with a son and daughter, Robert and Carolyn.
  Anna took time out from her career to raise her children but after 
the children matured, she went back to work as a pharmacist at 
Germantown Hospital from 1968 to 1991 and later volunteered her time at 
the hospital for over 20 years. Aside from her pharmacy career and 
being a homemaker, she played the cello in the Olney Symphony Orchestra 
for nearly 50 years and was active in several string quartet groups. 
Additionally, Anna served as Personnel Chairman for the Olney Symphony. 
She still remains in contact with many friends she made over the years 
in music.
  Her favorite activities have always included making family holiday 
dinners. Besides her two children, Anna has two grandchildren, Jon and 
Rob, and two great-granddaughters, Emma and Ava which happen to be 
identical twins. Additionally, she has a very supportive son-in-law, 
Sean Corsaut, and a loving daughter-in-law, Karen Perrong.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to please join me in extending our heartfelt 
congratulations, sincere well-wishes, and all of God&#x27;s Blessings to 
Anna Osinski Perrong on the celebration of her 100th Birthday.

            RECOGNIZING CONGRESSWOMAN CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 26, 2024

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor a dedicated public servant, loving wife and mother, champion for 
America&#x27;s Military Families, and a distinguished member of this body, 
Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. Earlier this year, Congresswoman 
McMorris Rodgers announced that she would not seek re-election to 
return to the House of Representatives and, in turn, would be stepping 
down as the co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Military Family 
Caucus.
  Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers cares deeply about our Nation&#x27;s 
veterans and Military Families because of her background as a military 
spouse and parent. In 2006, she married her husband, Brian Rodgers, a 
U.S. Naval Commander, and her experiences as the spouse of a U.S. 
servicemember empowered her to become a strong champion for America&#x27;s 
Military Families who often face unique challenges as they live and 
work in and around military installations in the United States and 
across the globe.
  When our servicemembers enlist in the Armed Forces, they must 
relocate to military installations--often with their spouses and young 
children. On base, military spouses and children must quickly navigate 
a new landscape which can pose challenges: new housing, new schools, 
seeking employment, and sometimes even moving abroad.
  After recognizing these same challenges in my district, serving as 
the Member of Congress representing U.S. Army servicemembers and their 
families at Fort Moore, Georgia--Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers and I 
joined together in 2009 to form the bipartisan Congressional Military 
Family Caucus. For the past 15 years, I have been honored to serve 
alongside the Congresswoman as her co-chair.
  Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers record of public service is historic 
and worthy of admiration. Growing up, she worked at the family orchard 
and fruit stand in Kettle Falls, Washington. In 1994, she won a special 
election to serve in the Washington House of Representatives, 
faithfully serving her district for 11 years, including 1 year as House 
Minority Leader before successfully running for the United States 
Congress.
  During her third term in Congress, McMorris Rodgers was elected by 
the House Republican Conference as the Vice Chair, and she would hold 
this role for four years before becoming only the second woman to serve 
as Chair of the Republican Conference from 2013 and 2019.
  In January 2021, McMorris Rodgers became the first woman to serve as 
the top Republican on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee 
as Ranking Member, and in 2023 becoming Chair. Chair McMorris Rodgers 
has been a leader on countless issues affecting the American people 
including emerging technologies, strengthening rural communities, 
helping to strengthen American energy resiliency and independence, and 
of course fighting for Military Families and veterans.
  Every year since we founded the Congressional Military Family Caucus, 
Co-chair McMorris Rodgers and I have hosted the Military Family Caucus 
Summit--alternating between Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, 
Washington, and Fort Moore in Georgia in order to give the members of 
America&#x27;s Armed Forces, their spouses, and their children an 
opportunity to hear from Department of Defense leaders and subject 
matter experts, share their experiences and challenges, and bring 
forward policies that improve the quality of life for our Military 
Families around the world.
  Over the past 15 years, the Caucus has brought to the forefront 
numerous issues that affect our servicemembers and Military Families. 
Together, we have tackled issues such as food insecurity, medical care, 
spousal employment, family relocation challenges, childcare, and so 
much more. But we cannot tackle these issues without community input. 
The Caucus has been very successful in bringing together our Military 
Families and veterans, veteran service organizations, Blue Star 
Families, Chambers of Commerce, community activists, and more so that 
we can have the robust discussions that these important issues deserve.
  On a personal note, I will greatly miss Cathy&#x27;s partnership and 
friendship on the Congressional Military Family Caucus, and she 
certainly has big shoes to fill as co-chair. During our time together 
in Congress, I have been inspired by her advocacy on behalf of 
individuals with disabilities, her dedication to our veterans and 
Military Families, and her commitment to statesmanship and 
bipartisanship in the United States Congress. And while the 
Congressional Military Family Caucus will continue on after her 
retirement, I look forward to joining her for our last Congressional 
Military Family Caucus Summit together in Spokane this August.
  Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers has accomplished so much in her 
life, and this was made possible by the grace of God and the love and 
support of her husband, Brian, as well as their three children--Cole, 
Grace, and Brynn.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join my wife, Vivian, and me; along with the people of her District, 
her state, and the American people in recognizing and commending 
Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers for her dedicated service to 
people, especially her leadership and advocacy for our Nation&#x27;s 
Military Families. While her leadership will be greatly missed in the 
halls of Congress, we wish her and her family the best as she embarks 
upon the next chapter of her life.

      REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA JACKSON LEE

                                 ______

                           HON. JOYCE BEATTY

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday July 22, 2024

  Mr. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I rise today, I join my Congressional 
colleagues, the Nation, the city of Houston, and the loved ones of 
Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee in mourning her passing.
  She began her journey to greatness by breaking barriers as a Yale 
University student, municipal judge, and Houston City Councilwoman 
before continuing her fight against injustice in the U.S. Congress. 
Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a pioneering advocate and a tireless 
champion for justice and civil rights, standing up for the most 
vulnerable and holding those in power accountable.
  Her legacy includes creating the Juneteenth federal holiday and her 
relentless fight for reparations to address the painful history of 
Black Americans. It features innovations in reauthorizing the Violence 
Against Women Act and a passionate persistence in reintroducing the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in May 2024. My Congressional 
sister was tireless in her work for voting rights, healthcare, 
education, and labor.
  As Chair Emerita of the Congressional Black Caucus, I am especially 
grateful for her guidance, intellectual command of issues, and service 
as my legal advisor and parliamentarian. As a Black woman, I felt 
immense pride watching her on the U.S. House Floor, confidently 
addressing subject matter experts in any field and prevailing.
  I will deeply miss our friendship, debates, laughs, and travels 
together, but I will always remember her as a ``national treasure.&#x27;&#x27;
  Rest in power to my friend. May her legacy and dedication strengthen 
and encourage us in the days ahead.
