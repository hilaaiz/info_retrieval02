    CELEBRATING ASAAD KELADA&#x27;S CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMERICAN TELEVISION

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 18, 2023

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize 
Asaad Kelada, a director and producer of many of America&#x27;s favorite 
sitcoms over the last 40+ years. His contribution to American cinema is 
worthy of commendation.
  Born in Egypt, Asaad began his studies at the American University in 
Cairo. In 1961, he earned a student visa and he came to the United 
States where he studied directing at the Yale School of Drama. After 
years of teaching drama and directing stage plays, Asaad got his first 
big break in 1976 when, after spending five years working on the set of 
the sitcom Rhonda, he was given an opportunity to direct an episode.
  Since then, Assad has been entertaining generations of American 
families with shows like WKRP in Cincinnati, The Facts of Life, Family 
Ties, Who&#x27;s the Boss, Everybody Loves Raymond, Dharma and Greg, Two and 
a Half Men, and The Office. Immigrants have always enriched and 
strengthened the fabric of our nation, and Asaad has said ``I never 
tried to minimize who I am. For me, being an Egyptian was one of the 
strongest aspects of what I had.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in 
celebrating Assad Kelada for his almost five decades of incredible 
work. As a young man, he quickly dazzled us with his humor and has been 
making families laugh together for decades, all while never forgetting 
his family and where he came from. He is exemplary of everything we 
highlight when we speak about the American Dream, and I am sure he will 
continue to make us laugh for years to come. I thank Asaad for his 
contributions.

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize 
Barbara L. McQuade, currently a professor of law at the University of 
Michigan Law School. Her service to her nation and the state of 
Michigan is worthy of commendation.
  Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Barbara earned her bachelor&#x27;s 
degree from the University of Michigan in 1987 and her J.D. from the 
University of Michigan Law School in 1991. She began her career at the 
law firm of Butzel Long in Detroit before serving as a clerk for the 
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. From 1998 to 
2010, Barbara was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District 
of Michigan on top of being a professor of law at Detroit Mercy School 
of Law from 2003 to 2009.
  In 2010, Barbara was appointed by President Obama to be the U.S. 
Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, the first woman to serve 
in that position and a post she held until 2017. During her tenure, she 
oversaw cases involving public corruption, terrorism, corporate fraud, 
and healthcare fraud, among others. A brilliant legal mind, Barbara has 
been quoted in the New York Times, Politico, Newsweek, and Time 
Magazine as well as serving as a legal analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. 
Back here in Michigan, Barbara has been a recipient of the Neal Shine 
Award for Exemplary Regional Leadership as well as The Detroit News 
Michiganian of the Year Award. Since 2017, she has served as the Law 
Professor from Practice at the University of Michigan Law School.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in 
celebrating Barbara L. McQuade&#x27;s service to our nation and to our great 
state of Michigan. No matter what position she has held, she has always 
been a bulwark against those who would prey on the weak from positions 
of power. Barbara is an incredible role model for public servants 
everywhere, and the future of our country is brighter with her teaching 
our children. I thank Barbara for her service.

  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to congratulate 21 
rising and graduated seniors from Riverview High School in Searcy.
  Each of these gifted students have taken and passed a dual-credit 
history course from their high school in partnership with Arkansas 
State University-Beebe.
  With this complete, they will already be ahead in their college 
education and be set for success wherever they may go.
  I was delighted to welcome these talented students to our Nation&#x27;s 
Capital just a few weeks ago and show them the history of the United 
States firsthand.
  To make the trip, these young men and women tirelessly raised the 
funds themselves by working concession stands and hosting car washes.
  Their hard work inside and outside of the classroom will ensure that 
they achieve excellence in their future endeavors.
  It&#x27;s wonderful to see the hard work of our students and I wish them 
continued success in their future education.

ranks. He has earned over thirty merit badges and has held several 
leadership positions in the troop including Historian, Patrol Leader, 
and Quartermaster. For Connor&#x27;s

Eagle Scout project, he made enhancements to Veterans Memorial Park in 
Egg Harbor Township. The project involved the installation of 
additional pavers to expand the standing room for ceremonies conducted 
at the park. He is a junior at Atlantic County Institute of Technology 
specializing in the Computer-Aided Design and Drafting program and is a

Cohen. The trail to Eagle Scout is marked by milestones and

the ranks, to earning merit badges and honing skills, he has 
demonstrated a thirst for knowledge and a willingness to embrace 
challenges. Daniel makes giving back to his community a priority and 
that is evident through his Eagle Scout Project. In an effort to help 
retire flags in a respectful way, Daniel built a flag retirement box 
for his local VFW. I know Daniel has a bright future ahead of him and I 
wish him all the best. God Bless Daniel Cohen and God Bless the United

  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize October as 
National Spina Bifida Awareness Month and to pay tribute to my 
constituents with Spina Bifida and their loved ones. Additionally, I 
recognize October 25th, as World Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Day.
  There are currently an estimated 166,000 individuals in the United 
States living with Spina Bifida. According to the CDC, each year 
approximately 1,400 babies born in the United States have spina bifida. 
Those diagnosed with Spina Bifida can expect to spend most of their 
lives in a wheelchair, or walking with braces, and face the prospect of 
dozens of surgeries they turn 18.
  I have been honored to attend numerous events in the Capital Region, 
including the Spina Bifida Walk and Roll and the Spina Bifida Dare to 
Dream Gala, both of which are held by the Spina Bifida Association 
(SBA) of Northeastern New York, that have raised funds for research, 
brought awareness to the public, and told the stories of those in our 
community with this disease. I am heartened to attend events like 
these. which do so much to honor those with spina bifida, as well as 
their friends, families, and caretakers.
  I am so impressed with the breakthroughs in research that have helped 
to give those living with this disease a more fulfilling life. Thanks 
to the work of organizations like SBA, new medical treatments and 
technologies have been developed that allow most people with Spina 
Bifida to live a normal life span, ensuring they can have a full 
career, get married, and start a family--no different than those 
without this disease.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to ensure that organizations like the Spina Bifida 
Association continue to receive the funding and support they have 
earned. I also will continue to support federal research funding for 
better understanding the condition, the cause, and treatments. I hope 
that together we can continue to raise awareness.

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 18, 2023

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize 
Reverend Freddie Banks, the Pastor of New Testament Baptist Church in 
Ypsilanti, Michigan, on the occasion of his retirement. For the last 40 
years, the leadership he has displayed for his congregation and his 
greater community is worthy of commendation.
  Reverend Banks was born in 1937 in Merigold, Mississippi. His family 
would later move to Ypsilanti, Michigan where he graduated from 
Ypsilanti High School in 1957. Shortly thereafter in 1959, Reverand 
Banks married his wonderful wife, Evelyn. Their legacy now includes 4 
children, 6 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren.
  Reverend Banks began his journey with the St. John Missionary Church 
of Ypsilanti in 1965. There he served as Sunday School superintendent, 
President of the Usher Board, and Chairman of the Deacon Board. He 
would preach his first sermon in September 1977 and was ordained as 
Assistant Pastor in 1978. Reverend Banks attended classes at the 
Detroit Bible College, later the William Tyndale Bible College, where 
he graduated in 1984.
  Reverend Banks went on to serve at St. Mary Baptist Church in 1983 as 
their Assistant Pastor. Later, he was called to preach at Fellowship of 
Believers, which was later named New Testament Missionary Baptist 
Church. His service to the community includes execution of marriage 
ceremonies, providing marriage counseling, and providing funeral 
services.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in 
recognizing and celebrating the lifetime of work that Reverend Freddie 
Banks has been kind enough to share with us. He has spent his entire

           RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF LT. COL. GEORGE CARRUTHERS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. CHIP ROY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, October 18, 2023

  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the life and 
legacy of Lieutenant Colonel George Carruthers. October 22, 2023, marks 
Lt. Col. Carruthers 100th birthday and the awarding of the prestigious 
French Legion of Honor medal--the highest level of recognition awarded 
by the French Government for his service to the country during WWII.
  Lt. Col. Carruthers began his military career by joining the Army Air 
Corps at nineteen years old, where he proceeded to be a 2nd Lieutenant 
Bombardier during WWII. During the war, his B-17 was shot down, and he 
spent 22 months in the German POW camp Stalag Luft 3, home of the Great 
Escape, the largest escape by allied Air Force personnel of the war.
  After the war, he went on to have a thirty-plus year career in the 
United States Air Force, being awarded numerous medals, including the 
Distinguished Flying Cross, several Air Medals, and the Purple Heart in 
recognition of his outstanding and selfless service.
  We are able to live free today because of the courage of men like Lt. 
Col. Carruthers, who put their lives on hold and answered their 
country&#x27;s call when it needed them most. Love of family, country, and a 
life dedicated to service sum up the character of Lt. Col. Carruthers, 
a member of the Greatest Generation. These stories will inspire future 
generations of Americans to pursue a life dedicated to causes greater 
than themselves. I hope this testament to Lt. Col. Carruthers&#x27; life 
serves as an acknowledgment of the immeasurable debt of gratitude owed 
to him by the American people. On behalf of Texas&#x27; 21st Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
extraordinary life of Lt. Col. Carruthers and his dedicated service to 
our country. Today, a grateful Nation thanks him.

                          ____________________
