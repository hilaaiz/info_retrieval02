  COMMEMORATING GRAND RIVER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR WINNING AP PROGRAM 
                                 AWARDS

                                  _____
                                 

                        HON. HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 17, 2024

  Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the excellence 
of Grand River Preparatory, a High School of Michigan&#x27;s Third 
Congressional District. I commend the faculty at this high school for 
their dedication, perseverance, and performance. They were recently 
awarded with the 2023 AP Honor Roll Platinum Award and the 2023 AP 
Access Award for their ability to go above and beyond in making college 
preparatory resources accessible to students.
  These awards are given to schools in which the percentage of 
underrepresented and low-income students involved with the school&#x27;s AP 
Program is the same or greater than the percentage of underrepresented 
students in the school&#x27;s graduating class. In 2023, over 4,000 schools 
participated in the consideration of this award. On behalf of myself 
and our West Michigan community, I applaud Grand River Preparatory for 
becoming the only high school in Michigan to achieve this major 
accomplishment.
  The Grand River Preparatory High School has been a constant example 
of excellence by outperforming peers in surrounding schools by 3.5 
months each year, according to research done by Stanford University. 
The school&#x27;s teachers, students and employees have worked tirelessly to 
assure that all students can pursue their dreams in an equitable way.
  Mr. Speaker, once more I ask my colleagues to join me in commending 
the Grand River Preparatory High School. There is no doubt that these 
young students have a prosperous future ahead of them.

                          ____________________

   HONORING KARL KREISER FOR 28 YEARS OF COACHING AT COLUMBIA SCHOOL 
                                DISTRICT

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 17, 2024

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Karl Kreiser 
on his retirement after serving as a coach to Columbia High School 
Basketball for 28 years.
  Karl served a total of seventeen years as the Girls Varsity Head 
Coach, while also coaching the varsity boys&#x27; team for four years and 
acting as the skipper for the boys&#x27; junior high team for an additional 
seven years.
  Karl followed in the footsteps of his father, Elmer Kreiser, the 
Columbia Boys Basketball Coaching legend who established the program&#x27;s 
legacy across the Commonwealth.
  Respected on and off the court, Karl&#x27;s coaching was defined by his 
mentorship. The focal point of his leadership was ensuring his players 
knew the importance of giving back to the people in the community.
  The legacy of Coach Karl Kreiser is displayed all around the Crimson 
Tide gymnasium in the form of banners and trophies adorning the walls. 
Over his nearly three decades of coaching, Karl won 431 games. In his 
last four seasons with the Girls Varsity Team, Columbia won three 
section crowns, a league title, while making it to four district 
championships, and three state playoffs.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Coach Karl Kreiser on a 
remarkable career and wish him well as he begins his well-deserved 
retirement.

   HONORING THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TENNYSON CENTER FOR CHILDREN

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. DIANA DeGETTE

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 17, 2024

  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 120th 
anniversary of the Tennyson Center for Children in Denver, Colorado.
  Established in 1904, Tennyson Center for Children has been committed 
to serving Colorado&#x27;s most neglected and abused children.
  Their high-quality programs have changed lives and led to successful 
outcomes for many of those who use their services. Supporting at-risk 
youth and keeping families together helps to secure bright futures for 
children and puts them on a path to success, and Tennyson has worked to 
support families across Colorado.
  Ninety-one percent of the children who rely on Tennyson services have 
experienced trauma, neglect, or abuse. To address the complex needs of 
this population, Tennyson offers a breadth of services, including child 
and family therapy, parenting support, behavior management, education 
support, and childcare.
  Thanks to these services, 98 percent of families who sought 
assistance at Tennyson stayed together.
  In 2023, I worked with Tennyson to secure federal funding to assist 
in the construction of the mental health residential treatment center.
  This center focuses on the urgent and unmet mental health needs of 
vulnerable, low-income children with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities. The new center will help Tennyson better serve vulnerable 
youth in our communities by increasing access to essential mental 
health treatment.
  I look forward to our continued partnership to ensure Tennyson can 
continue to provide life-changing care to those most at risk of abuse 
and trauma.
  One hundred and twenty-nine years of service to Colorado is a 
tremendous accomplishment, and I congratulate the entire staff at 
Tennyson on achieving this milestone. Tennyson Center for Children is a 
fixture of our community, and I am honored to recognize its 120th 
anniversary.

                    OPPOSING H.R. 6603 AND H.R. 5826

                                  _____
                                 

                          HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 17, 2024

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise concerning my votes on H.R. 
6603 and H.R. 5826 on April 16, 2024.
  With regard to H.R. 6603, I fully support the use of the Foreign 
Direct Product Rule to restrict Iran&#x27;s ability to develop weapons 
technologies, especially technologies used by Iran for its April 2024 
attack on Israel. However, H.R. 6603 would represent a 
counterproductive restriction of the flexibility that has enabled the 
Commerce Department to effectively restrict Iran&#x27;s access to materials 
and technology that can be used to produce drones and missiles. While I 
have no concerns about expanding the application of the Foreign Direct 
Product Rule to include the additional categories enumerated within the 
bill, I believe this expansion must be done in coordination with U.S. 
partners to avoid creating an outcome that hurts our allies without 
addressing Iranian proliferation. This bill would threaten 
relationships with key partners, including the United Kingdom, 
Australia, Canada, and others that have allowed the United States to 
effectively counter malign actions by the Iranian government and I 
voted no as a result.
  With regard to H.R. 5826, I voted no out of concern that Section 8 of 
the bill could result in reciprocal actions from Iran to restrict the 
travel of Iranians to the United States--preventing asylum-seekers and 
others from escaping Iran&#x27;s authoritarian government. The bill would 
additionally prevent thousands of Iranian Americans from being able to 
visit family in Iran and similarly restrict visas by journalists, 
educators, and other visitors who contribute to positive connections 
between the people of Iran and the outside world. I also oppose 
provisions in Section 6 of H.R. 5826 that would break with decades of 
diplomatic precedent and undermine U.S. capacity to negotiate with Iran 
by restricting how Iranian government officials can travel to the 
United States to attend meetings at the United Nations Headquarters in 
New York City.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 17, 2024

  Mrs. HOUCHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National PEO 
Week, which starts May 19 and ends May 25, 2024.
  National PEO Week will celebrate the important contributions of the 
professional employer organization (PEO) industry, which provides 
payroll, employee benefits, compliance assistance, and HR services to 
hundreds of thousands of small and mid-sized businesses that employ 
more than 4.5 million people.
  PEOs play a critical role in helping businesses grow and thrive, 
during good times and bad. PEOs help their small business clients grow 
7-9 percent faster, have employee turnover that is 10-14 percent lower, 
and are 50 percent less likely to go out of business than businesses 
that do not use a PEO.
  PEOs help small businesses improve productivity and profitability and 
focus on their core mission. Through a PEO, the employees of small 
businesses gain access to important employee benefits such as: 401(k) 
plans; health, dental, life, and other insurance; dependent care; and 
other benefits they might not typically receive as employees of a small 
company.
  I know the value that PEOs provide. Before coming to Congress, I 
worked for a PEO and witnessed the positive impact they had on small 
businesses in my home state of Indiana.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the PEO industry for all 
they do to help our Nation&#x27;s small businesses and their employees 
prosper.

                       Wednesday, April 17, 2024

  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the significance and 
importance of Education and Sharing Day, a commemoration in honor of 
The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, and the values of 
education and moral cultivation for which he stood.
  The Rebbe emphasized the significance of moral and ethical education 
as the foundation of humanity and an essential characteristic of a 
thriving society. Throughout his lifetime, his work cultivated hope for 
a brighter future through the establishment of more than 6,000 
educational and social institutions across all 50 states and in 100 
countries spanning six continents.
  Over the last four decades, the U.S. Congress has set aside 
``Education and Sharing Day,&#x27;&#x27; and the recognition is proclaimed 
annually by presiding U.S. presidents on the anniversary of the Rebbe&#x27;s 
birth, in honor of his commitment to teaching the next generation of 
Americans the values that make our country strong. Remembering the 
Rebbe&#x27;s message of education and contribution to society, Education and 
Sharing Day provides the opportunity to recognize our responsibility in 
ensuring that our Nation&#x27;s youth have the tools to live a life of 
purpose and fulfillment.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in 
celebrating April 19, 2024 as Education and Sharing Day, to honor the 
birthday of Rabbi Schneerson.

 RECOGNIZING VERLA THOMAS GETTING HER FATHER A PURPLE HEART MEDAL 100 
                   YEARS AFTER HE WAS WOUNDED IN WWI

                                  _____
                                 

                        HON. HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Wednesday, April 17, 2024

  Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the commitment 
of my constituent Verla Thomas in getting her father, the late Corporal 
George Wills of Spring Lake, a Purple Heart medal over 100 years after 
he was shot and wounded in World War I. I also commend Dr. Chris Petras 
for his continued research and efforts to help West Michiganders secure 
such medals from the Army.
  Dr. Chris Petras has dedicated much of his time to researching 
Company F Grand Haven WWI soldiers. His work has led to 20 Purple 
Hearts being awarded to veterans, a feat that deserves recognition and 
applause. As a member of the Sons of the American Legion Squadron 28 
Grand Haven, Dr. Petras got his start in 2019 when he sought out to 
learn more about a significant figure in the post, Charles A. Conklin. 
After digging through National Archives documents, military documents, 
and numerous publications, he sent over the information he found for 
review to the U.S. Army who then affirmed Conklin&#x27;s eligibility for the 
Purple Heart. Dr. Chris Petras&#x27; determination in ensuring these 
soldiers are recognized for their sacrifice and service is truly 
admirable.
  I had the great honor of working alongside Dr. Petras to help Verla 
Thomas acquire the posthumous Purple Heart medal and WWI Victory medal 
for her father&#x27;s service. Several members of the military, veterans, 
and local residents attended the award ceremony in honor of her 
father&#x27;s legacy. It was a truly touching moment to present Verla with 
these awards. She serves as an inspiration for my team and our district 
as we seek to give others the recognition they deserve.
