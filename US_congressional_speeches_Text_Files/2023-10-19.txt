              CELEBRATING EDEN HOUSING&#x27;S 55TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ERIC SWALWELL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize Eden 
Housing, which will celebrate 55 years since it first opened its doors, 
on Friday, October 27, 2023. Eden Housing provides dignified, 
affordable housing to residents across the state of California.
  Eden Housing was founded in 1968 by community activists in Hayward, 
California. Led by California State University, Hayward Professor Bill 
Vandenburgh, Eden Housing&#x27;s mission is to provide safe, non-
discriminatory, affordable housing in Alameda County. Following this 
mission, Eden Housing&#x27;s first project was to rehabilitate six older 
homes in Oakland so that each family could keep making memories without 
sacrificing safety.
  Eden Housing also develops high-quality housing communities for low-
income families, seniors, veterans, and persons with disabilities 
throughout my district, the wider Bay Area, and California. Eden 
Housing properties ensure that residents receive supplemental resident 
and enrichment programs to support their well-being. These services 
include wellness checks, physical education, and financial workshops.
  Over the course of its history, Eden Housing has developed nearly 
12,000 affordable housing units across 155 properties in California, 
with more than 100,000 residents calling Eden Housing properties home. 
Since its inception, Eden Housing has also awarded over 620 
scholarships to residents totaling more than $1 million in support of 
their academic and professional goals.
  It has been my privilege to support Eden Housing&#x27;s work by passing a 
direct appropriation of $1 million for the development of a veterans&#x27; 
park in Livermore. Their hard work was also recently recognized by the 
Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund award of $10 million.
  In sum, Eden Housing is pivotal to improving California neighborhoods 
through nurturing relationships with residents and diverse community 
partners. I am grateful for the 55 years of hard work that Eden Housing 
has undertaken to become a leader in the establishment of affordable 
housing in our state. I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating 
Eden Housing&#x27;s legacy and wish it many more productive years to come.

                CLOSE AGENCY LOOPHOLES TO THE JONES ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I reintroduce the 
``Close Agency Loopholes to the Jones Act of 2023,&#x27;&#x27; which would close 
nearly 50 years of anti-Jones Act decisions--known as ``letter 
rulings&#x27;&#x27;--by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
  As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and 
having served as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation from 2013 to 2018, I am committed to rebuilding 
the U.S.-flagged fleet including international and Jones Act vessels. 
For decades, Congress has stood idly by while federal regulators 
chipped away at the Jones Act, allowing foreign vessels paying poverty 
wages to take jobs from Americans working in our maritime industry. 
That must stop.
  In December 2020, Congress enacted my amendment to the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act as section 9503 of the William M. (Mac) 
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 
(Public Law 116-283) affirming that the application of the 
Constitution, laws, and civil and political jurisdiction of the United 
States to the Outer Continental Shelf also applies to non-mineral 
energy resources and exploring for, developing, producing, 
transporting, or transmitting such resources. As I stated in my remarks 
on September 24, 2020 (Congressional Record, Vol. 166, No. 166), 
Congress always intended U.S. law to apply to any form of exploration, 
development, production, transportation, and transmission of energy 
resources under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953.
  On January 25, 2021, President Biden&#x27;s first executive order (no. 
14005) directed federal agencies to maximize the use of American 
mariners, American-built ships, and U.S.-flagged vessels under the 
Jones Act. In response to my amendment enacted in the FY21 NOAA, U.S. 
CBP issued a headquarters ruling letter ``HQ H309186&#x27;&#x27; on January 27, 
2021, correctly holding that the transportation of ``scour protection&#x27;&#x27; 
materials from the Port of Providence, Rhode Island to a wind project 
on the Outer Continental Shelf off the southeast shore of Martha&#x27;s 
Vineyard is a coastwise activity under the Jones Act.
  On March 17, 2021, the national trade association for the offshore 
wind industry sent a letter to the Commissioner of CBP requesting that 
the agency withdraw HQ H309186. In this letter, the offshore wind 
industry mischaracterized my September 2020 remarks from the 
Congressional Record as somehow supporting its request that CBP 
withdraw the January 27, 2021, letter ruling. On March 25, 2021, CBP 
issued a revised headquarters ruling letter (HQ H317289) contradicting 
its January 2021 letter ruling and the President&#x27;s stated policy, 
allowing foreign vessels to construct energy projects on the Outer 
Continental Shelf.
  To be clear, my September 2020 remarks in the Congressional Record 
stated that my amendment to Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act simply 
clarified that all forms of offshore energy development are indeed 
subject to the same U.S. laws that apply to the offshore oil and gas 
industry. That does not mean that I accept the validity of the many 
administrative loopholes to the Jones Act created by decades of bad 
letter rulings and poor enforcement by CBP. Rather, I have long held 
that many of the activities regulators have incorrectly allowed the 
offshore oil and gas industry to engage in using foreign-flagged 
vessels are clear violations of the plain text of the Jones Act and 
original Congressional intent.
  It is now clear to me that the regulators at CBP are unwilling to 
fully implement the Jones Act, as directed by President Biden&#x27;s 
Executive Order 14005. My `Closing Agency Loopholes to the Jones Act&#x27; 
would finally force federal regulators to enforce the law as Congress 
intended in 1920, maximizing job opportunities for American mariners, 
U.S.-flagged vessels, and domestic shipyard workers. In effect, my 
legislation would also compel CBP to implement the President&#x27;s stated 
policy by fully enforcing the Jones Act.
  On April 26, 2023, the House Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure passed two key sections from my bill in the ``Coast 
Guard Authorization Act of 2023&#x27;&#x27; (H.R. 2741 ). Sections 8 and 9 from 
my bill are now incorporated as Section 312 (Notification) and Section 
313 (Publication of Fines and Penalties) of H.R. 2741.
  Section 312 requires foreign-flagged vessels purporting to operate 
under a Jones Act exemption to notify CBP and post online its legal 
basis for operating on the Outer Continental Shelf. Currently, CBP uses 
an honor system for foreign vessels operating on the Outer Continental 
Shelf and their legal basis for doing, which undermines the agency&#x27;s&#x27; 
ability to enforce the Jones Act properly and enables outright fraud. 
Section 313 requires CBP to publish online any penalties against 
foreign-flagged vessels operating illegally on the Outer Continental 
Shelf, including for failing to notify the agency of the purported 
Jones Act exemption in advance.
  For this Congress, I also require in my bill that offshore energy 
developers on the Outer Continental Shelf pay a prevailing wage. Under 
current law, project developers operating in the United States&#x27; 
Exclusive Economic Zone at sea can pay poverty wages, exploiting 
foreign workers and undermining American mariners&#x27; ability to compete 
for this work. After decades of failed promises, we are finally 
building the clean energy economy of the future. American mariners are 
ready, willing, and able to work in the burgeoning offshore wind 
industry. But they cannot be expected to compete against foreign-flag 
vessels paying poverty wages to workers with no legally guaranteed 
collective bargaining rights or labor standards.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I encourage all members of the House to 
cosponsor this critical and long overdue legislation.

                          ____________________

                HONORING KATHLEEN AND WILLIAM WISNEWSKI

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor a true 
Long Island ``power couple&#x27;&#x27;--Kathleen and William Wisnewski--who are 
both retiring this year after distinguished multi-decade long careers 
at National Grid--the leading energy provider in my district. Bill 
began his service at National Grid--then known as LILCO--in 1986 as a 
meter reader making $7.50 an hour. A second-generation company 
employee, he put himself through night school and rose through the 
ranks as a gas and electric planner, field inspector, contractor 
supervisor, and finally field trainer, ensuring that future generations 
of National Grid employees will adhere to the same high standards and 
dedication he so diligently displayed over his long career. Bill was 
also long active in IBEW Local 1049 at times serving as a shop steward 
and on the executive board, effectively representing his fellow 
employees through several acquisitions and successful contract 
negotiations.
  Kathy started at the company in 1989 after graduating with a degree 
in business administration from Hofstra University. Initially hired as 
an energy specialist in the conservation services department, Kathy 
climbed the corporate ladder at LILCO, Keyspan and now National Grid 
eventually ascending to Director of Customer and Community Relations 
for all of Long Island. In this position--and all throughout her career 
at National Grid--Kathy worked every day to strengthen communities 
across the island and help my constituents access the essential energy 
resources that power their lives. There was no better example of this 
than Kathy&#x27;s work in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy--a historic storm 
that devastated my district in 2012. Kathy put in countless hours on 
behalf of National Grid customers, connecting them to critical disaster 
relief and working to restore their life sustaining energy service as 
safely and efficiently as possible. For these efforts she was 
recognized by several municipalities and community organizations 
including the city of Long Beach and its Martin Luther King Center.
  I also want to acknowledge Kathy&#x27;s service on the boards of Girls 
Inc. and Vision Long Island. Her leadership in these organizations 
dedicated to empowering young girls and building a more vibrant and 
livable community guarantees that her positive impact on Long Island 
will continue to be felt for decades to come.
  For over thirty years, through overnights, weekends, holidays and 
countless storms--Kathy and Bill did their part to make sure the lights 
and heat came on when their neighbors needed it the most. We thank them 
and thousands of National Grid employees just like them who work day-in 
and day-out to literally power our communities.
  While this is certainly a loss for National Grid and my constituents, 
their well-earned retirement will allow them to spend more time with 
their daughters Jennifer and Bridget and dogs Harley and Winnie. I am 
happy they are staying in Lindenhurst, the town they have called home 
since 1993 and wish them many years of smooth sailing as they captain 
their boat ``Club Wiz&#x27;&#x27; across the Great South Bay and along the South 
Shore communities in my district. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, please join 
me in congratulating William and Kathleen Wisnewski on this momentous 
occasion and thanking them for their years of dedicated service.

                          ____________________

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize our 
Texas-24 Hometown Hero, retired United States Secret Service Special 
Agent in Charge (SAIC) of the Dallas Field Office William Smarr. SAIC 
Smarr has spent more than two decades protecting our nation&#x27;s leaders 
before retiring on October 13, 2023.

[[Page E996]]

  Mr. Smarr began his career in 1999 in the Pittsburgh Field Office 
with subsequent assignments in the Houston Field Office and the 
Presidential Protective Division in Washington, D.C. In addition to 
providing protection to our nation&#x27;s leaders and investigating threats 
against the President, Mr. Smarr managed high-profile transnational 
fraud investigations involving the targeting of U.S. financial 
infrastructure and private industry victims. During his time as the 
Senior Executive for the North Texas District, SAIC Smarr led all 
operations involving executive protection and criminal investigations 
with offices in Dallas, Lubbock, Tyler and Waco. Before assuming his 
role in the Dallas Field Office, Mr. Smarr led as the Deputy SAIC in 
Houston, TX, where he oversaw the Secret Service&#x27;s investigative and 
protective portfolio covering all southeast Texas and the country of 
Mexico. SAIC Smarr has dedicated his life to the integrated mission and 
responsibilities of the United States Secret Service and fulfilled his 
role with honor. I thank SAIC Smarr for all he had done to protect and 
serve our great Nation. I wish him the best in his well-deserved 
retirement.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to honor the life of 
David Nixon, who passed away on October 1, 2023, at the age of 64 after 
a courageous seven year battle with cancer.
  Growing up in Roanoke, David and I first crossed paths in high school 
when we were on opposite sides of a political battle. He went to 
Glenvar High School, and I went to Andrew Lewis High School. Throughout 
the political debate to name the new high school in Salem, David always 
presented his views in a calm, honest manner. I knew from that 
experience that I had met a man of honor.
  I often think of the Abraham Lincoln quote when thinking of David, 
``the best way to destroy an enemy is to make him a friend.&#x27;&#x27; Instead 
of vilifying each other, we got to know each other and came to have 
deep respect for one another.
  It is remarkable to me how much our lives mirrored one another. After 
attending Roanoke College and Wake Forest University law school, he 
returned home to practice law, as I did to Salem after attending law 
school. He served as Chairman of the Roanoke City Republican Committee 
while I was Chairman of the Salem Republican Committee. I am thankful 
that he was a strong supporter of my many political campaigns over the 
years.
  During his life he was appointed Escheator by Governor Allen for 
Roanoke City, 1994, for 23rd Judicial District, 2001. He also served as 
Vice President of Legal Affairs, Blue Ridge Housing Development 
Corporation; Chairman, Roanoke City Fair Housing Board; and Member, 
Roanoke City Parks and Recreation Citizen Advisory Board.
  A devout member of New Century Church in Roanoke, Virginia, David 
served many years as a volunteer greeter. After being diagnosed with 
stage four cancer in 2016, David used his remaining years to grow 
closer to Christ, finding peace and joy in his diagnosis.
  David is survived by his son Kirk Nixon (Darlene Smith) and 
granddaughter Ella Nixon; daughter Jessica (Nick Blandy), grandchildren 
Finn and Declan Blandy; siblings, Carolyn ``Kack&#x27;&#x27; Lynch, John, and 
Debbie Nixon; twin sister, Denise ``Cee&#x27;&#x27; and Alan Campbell; as well as 
many nieces, nephews,

[[Page E997]]

great-nieces, and great-nephews; and, his many friends, some of whom 
David considered like family. I pray for all of his loved ones during 
this difficult time.
  David was a good Republican and a good Christian. He loved his family 
and friends deeply and lived his last days to the fullest, despite his 
diagnosis.
  I, and many others, will greatly miss him.

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, St. Louis and I rise to celebrate 
the 90th anniversary of the Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church 
in Missouri&#x27;s First District.
  The Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church has been a spiritual 
beacon in the St. Louis community. Under the leadership of Reverend 
Reginald D. Rogers, Sr., the church has provided meals for those in 
need and organized health fairs for residents in the surrounding 
neighborhoods.
  The church has also been an avid supporter of Annie Malone Children 
and Family Services. I am thankful for their work and commitment to 
community service, including partnering with Beyond Me Outreach, which 
sits under the North City Community Development Corporation.
  I wish the Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church success in their 
future endeavors, including their goal of constructing an educational 
facility to promote literacy among youth in the First District.
  St. Louis honors the Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church on a 
blessed 90 years of service and worship.

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I&#x27;m honored to recognize Living 
Spring Harrisburg Church, a parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of 
God, as it celebrates 20 years of Christian ministry on November 4, 
2023.
  The Living Spring congregation was founded on November 2, 2003, under 
the distinguished leadership of Senior Pastor Tunde Oyelowo and his 
wife, Pastor Yinka Oyelowo. The Church, over the past two decades, has 
inspired faith, community service, and spiritual enlightenment. Its 
incredible growth from 8 to 500 members now represents 33 nations and a 
unique array of lingual and ethnic communities throughout South Central 
Pennsylvania.
  The Church&#x27;s vision of transforming lives, empowering people, and 
impacting communities is carried out through its 60,000 square foot, 
state-of-the-art International Center, accompanied by 8 flourishing 
local churches that extend to Lancaster, Lebanon, York, and Carlisle. 
The Church&#x27;s reach, impact, and inspiration of unity and communal 
growth is yet another sign of God&#x27;s enduring faithfulness and 
blessings.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, on behalf of the 10th Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania, I&#x27;m honored and humbled to recognize Living Spring 
Harrisburg Church and 2 decades of success. Living Spring&#x27;s cultivation 
of moral values, charitable activity, and community faith is truly the 
epitome of God&#x27;s work, and I wish its community continued great health, 
happiness, prosperity, and success for many years to come.

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is my privilege to 
recognize and honor the United States Air Force 555th Civil Engineering 
Squadron, ``Triple Nickel,&#x27;&#x27; as one of the original RED HORSE units for

Initially designated as ``Prime BEEF Heavy Repair&#x27;&#x27; units, these 
squadrons quickly distinguished themselves, prompting leaders to coin 
the term ``RED HORSE,&#x27;&#x27; an acronym for Rapid Engineer Deployable, Heavy 
Operations Repair Squadron--Engineering. Their mission was crucial--to 
establish a long-term civil engineering presence and provide major 
repair capabilities in the combat zones of Southeast Asia.
  The deployment of RED HORSE units was a strategic move at a critical 
juncture in the war when the demands on Army and Navy construction 
units far exceeded their capacity. With the Army and Navy construction 
forces fully engaged, RED HORSE units emerged to fill the need. Upon 
deployment to Cam Ranh Air Base, South Vietnam, the Triple Nickel unit 
immediately began operations by hitting the beach with supplies and 
heavy equipment.
  Civil engineer units from across the United States were assigned to 
various Air Force installations throughout Vietnam, including Cam Ranh, 
with some of the most distinguished officers and airmen being selected 
for RED HORSE duty. The 1969 roster that served in the 555th CES was 
composed of four hundred civil engineer personnel, arriving in Vietnam 
at the height of the war and responding to urgent infrastructural needs 
following the Tet Offensive of 1968. which delivered damaging blows to 
American installations up and down the peninsula.
  Cam Rahn Air Base required significant infrastructure to sustain the 
war effort--from paved landing strips to dormitory housing for the 
troops. Triple Nickel not only repaired and constructed new facilities 
on Cam Ranh Air Base but also saw action at various American and 
Vietnam installations throughout the peninsula--from the Delta to the 
DMZ. In Vietnam, over two thousand RED HORSE troops deployed annually 
where they built both horizontal and vertical facilities to support the 
Air Force&#x27;s mission and engaged in numerous humanitarian projects for 
local communities.
  As the Vietnam War began to wind down in the early 1970s there were 
calls to deactivate units that had been formed during the war. However, 
thanks to the foresight of certain military and Congressional leaders 
who recognized the inherent value RED HORSE provides to the Air Force 
in both peace and war, multiple units remain in National Guard and 
Reserve organizations.
  In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, the bonds formed during the 
conflict were not only maintained but strengthened. Now, veterans of 
Triple Nickel who served together in Vietnam occasionally gather to 
celebrate the friendships, accomplishments, and bonds that were forged 
in the challenging environment of a war-torn country.
  It is my distinct honor to recognize the 555th Civil Engineering 
Squadron, ``Triple Nickel,&#x27;&#x27; for the critical role they held in the 
Vietnam War and the enduring bond they maintain today.

                      RECOGNIZING HILL TOP BAKERY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I rise to recognize the 
100th anniversary of the Hill Top Bakery in Kaukauna.
  For the past 100 years, the Hill Top Bakery in Kaukauna has provided 
exceptional customer service and delicious, daily made, old-fashioned 
baked goods for people throughout Wisconsin. Originally a horse stable, 
their building on 7th and Main in Kaukauna was repurposed into a bakery 
and opened in 1923, where it still remains to this day. To say baking 
runs in the family is an understatement. Mark and Lynn Engel have owned 
and operated the location for nearly 30 years after they took it over 
from Lynn&#x27;s parents, Harry and Diane Wirth, who ran the Bakery for the 
previous 26 years. The family&#x27;s commitment to outstanding service and 
quality products for more than 50 years has made Hill Top Bakery a 
staple in Northeast Wisconsin.
  In addition to offering delicious baked goods for people throughout 
Northeast Wisconsin, Hill Top Bakery is known for its unwavering 
support of Kaukauna and the greater Fox Valley community. The Bakery 
has donated goods to organizations like Project Purpose, a 
collaborative mural experience that centers around students in Special 
Education at Appleton East High School. During Breast Cancer Awareness 
Month in October, the Bakery donates a portion of its proceeds to the 
Breast Cancer Research Foundation. I commend the dedication and 
unwavering support that the Hill Top Bakery team has shown to our 
community.
  100 years in operation is no small feat and at Hill Top Bakery they 
have the perfect recipe for success, incredible people, a Northeast 
Wisconsin work ethic, and generations of family recipes that have been 
acquired over the last century. From their famous peanut squares to 
their cherry chip cookies, Hill Top Bakery provides top-notch baked 
goods to the people of Wisconsin. It is evident due to their continued 
success that the Hill Top Bakery is committed to providing homemade, 
authentic, and old-fashioned bakery items for people throughout 
Northeast Wisconsin, all the while making our community a better place.
  I invite all members of this body to join me in celebrating the 100th 
anniversary of Hill Top Bakery. I extend my sincerest congratulations 
to Mark and Lynn Engel and the entire Hill Top Bakery team on this 
remarkable milestone and wish them continued success for years to come.

                          ____________________

RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 2023 AMHERST CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
                             AWARD WINNERS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I am honored 
to recognize six businesses, organizations, and individuals that have 
been instrumental to the growth of Amherst, NY. As the pillar of the 
business community in Western New York&#x27;s most populous suburb, the 
Amherst Chamber of Commerce has the responsibility of identifying many 
of our community leaders. At this ``Excellence Event,&#x27;&#x27; there is no 
shortage of men and women who have put the interests of their neighbors 
ahead of their own.
  This year&#x27;s winner of the Stewardship Award is Goodwill of Western 
New York. Their mission of caring for others is not only commendable 
but has a tangible impact on countless individuals within our 
community. Goodwill&#x27;s programs give those seeking employment a chance 
to showcase their skills and ambition in a productive environment. They 
take pride in helping to lift those from unemployment or 
underemployment while collecting millions of pounds in local donations. 
Annually, Goodwill of Western New York supports well over 1,000 
individuals in their pursuit of workforce development programs. It is 
my hope that Goodwill can continue to expand their services and build 
on the success that earned them this year&#x27;s Stewardship Award.
  After more than six decades of serving Western New York families and 
businesses, Lawley Insurance is awarded this year&#x27;s Family-Owned 
Business Award. A third-generation family business, Lawley has become a 
premiere agency in the eyes of the community they serve. Since the 
beginning, their leadership team placed an emphasis on ethics and 
maintaining the strength of the Western New York region. With offices 
across New York, Connecticut. and New Jersey, the current stewards of 
Lawley Insurance have never lost sight of their home in Buffalo. With 
great pride in this local group, I wish Lawley Insurance a bright 
future in our region.
  Spectrum Reach, the advertising arm of Charter Communications, will 
receive this year&#x27;s Chairman&#x27;s Award. Just this year, Charter has 
mentored over 700 multicultural businesses.
  This program, ``Pay It Forward,&#x27;&#x27; is an effort to give businesses 
free advertising, creative services, and educational resources. In a 
fast-paced world so focused on the bottom line, it is reassuring to 
know that local partners at a company as large as Charter have a focus 
on bettering our community.
  Fittingly, Amherst Chamber of Commerce is bestowing Buffalo AKO Art 
Museum with the Commitment to Excellence Award. After nearly four years 
of construction, AKG has transformed their campus to become a 
nationwide leader in art and culture. This $230 million project was 
over a decade in the making and will undoubtedly be the hub to both 
local pride and outside tourism. As a longtime fixture in our 
community, it is nothing short of proper that we recognize the Buffalo 
AKG for their commitment to providing a welcoming atmosphere to feature 
world-class exhibitions while serving as a hub for creative and 
educational programs. Their new campus is nothing short of excellent 
and their recognition at this event is well-earned.
  This year&#x27;s Woman of Distinction Award is given to Jody Briandi, the 
President and Managing Partner of Hurwitz Fine P.C. A woman of numerous 
awards and recognitions, Jody has experience in state. federal, and 
appellate courts across New York State. Her sterling reputation as a 
professional litigator is matched by her willingness to improve her 
community and assist others. She has invested her time and attention to 
helping women realize their full leadership potential and advocate for 
diversity, equity, and inclusion. Jody is a success in all her 
endeavors and a model citizen in our community.
  Lastly, Gilbane Building Company is spearheading the project to build 
the new Buffalo Bills stadium and being recognized as the Business of 
the Year. A 1.35 million square foot structure, this task is no small 
feat, but will prove to be the home to our fans and community. 
Thousands of workers and hours of labor will be dedicated to this 
state-of-the-art facility under the leadership of Gilbane. Notably, 40 
percent of contracts for this project have been awarded to minority, 
women, or service-disabled veteran-owned companies. Gilbane is placing 
an emphasis on relationships with local businesses and residents to 
ensure that this project will benefit our local economy.
  Congratulations to the 2023 Amherst Chamber of Commerce honorees; 
Goodwill of Western New York, Lawley Insurance, Spectrum Reach, Buffalo 
AKG Museum, Jody Briandi, and Gilbane Building Company. I would like to 
thank each person, group, and company that continues to contribute to 
the growth and prosperity of Western New York.

                          ____________________

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize 
The Midwest Ismaili Arts Festival hosted by the Ismaili Council for the 
Midwestern United States. The Ismaili Arts Festival will be held at the 
Copernicus Center in Chicago, Illinois on Sunday, October 22, 2023.
  The Ismaili Arts Festival stands as a testament to the profound 
impact of the arts, serving as a platform for Ismaili artists to share 
their unique visions and creations with our community. This festival 
celebrates creativity, and promotes dialogue, diversity and 
understanding among residents of Illinois and visitors. These events 
elevate and illustrate the pluralistic values that are held by 
residents of Illinois and make Illinois a more vibrant and stronger 
community.
  This year, the Midwest Ismaili Arts Festival will bring together over 
200 Ismaili artists showcasing their artistic expression in the 
categories of performing arts, film festival and art gallery. The theme 
for this year&#x27;s festival is ``care,&#x27;&#x27; in which the artists will explore 
their personal interconnectivity with care for the environment, care 
for one&#x27;s heritage, and strengthening one&#x27;s identity.
  I am proud of the Ismaili Council for Midwestern United States and 
the Midwest Ismaili Arts Festival organizers, Ismaili Artists and 
Ismaili Volunteers who dedicate their time, knowledge, and passion to 
promote the arts.
  On behalf of the residents of the 9th District of the State of

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to honor the Pancretan 
Association of America (PAA) on their many achievements throughout 
their 94 years of dedicated service. I am thrilled to congratulate the 
PAA on the establishment of their first-ever National Headquarters at 
the Hellenic Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and on the recent election 
of their organization&#x27;s first female president, Diane Kounalakis.
  The PAA and the Pancretan Youth Association (PYA) offer a rich array 
of programs to cultivate and preserve the extraordinary heritage of the 
island of Crete. The PAA and PYA have supported the enrichment and 
personal development of both Cretan Americans and the general public 
through educational events, study abroad scholarships, dance and music 
workshops, and translations of Greek literature. The PAA also has a 
long and storied history of advancing essential causes on the island of 
Crete and throughout both Greece and the United States. From helping to 
establish Crete&#x27;s first public hospital in the 1950s to supporting 
orphanages, food pantries and disaster relief today, the PAA has made 
immense contributions.
  I have no doubt that President Diane Kounalakis, a longtime PAA 
member and volunteer, will be an exemplary leader for the PAA. Mr. 
Speaker Pro Tempore, I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding the 
PAA for its many decades of service, and in wishing the PAA all the 
best in the years to come.

     TRIBUTE TO DR. IRIS SHANNON, NURSE, EDUCATOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANNY K. DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, October 19, 2023

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I wish to pay 
my deepest respects to Dr. Iris Shannon--a nurse, educator and 
administrator. I met and got to know Iris Shannon in the late 1960s 
when I began to work in healthcare, first at the Dr. Martin King Health 
Center, the Westside Health Planning Organization and Mile Square 
Health Center.
  I knew Iris as a competent, involved nurse, as Director of Nursing at 
Mile Square, as Director of Nursing at Rush Medical Center and as a 
Nursing Professor at Rush Medical School. The late 1960s and early 
1970s were very serious health interest years and health activity due 
to the civil rights activity, changes in health law and the leadership 
of Democrats in government. These changes in health took place at all 
levels of government and Iris was what I call an activist.
  There were meetings about health all over the place and practically 
all of the time. Iris was often present at many of these meetings, 
sharing her knowledge, her expertise and her wisdom. Iris worked with 
nurse groups, administrative groups, community groups, women

[[Page E999]]

groups, black power group and the list goes on.
  If it was about health and health care needs, Iris was there. Iris 
was an organizer, a joiner, a promoter, a practitioner, a scholar, a 
teacher, a mentor and a role model, not loud, but a leader who became 
President of the American Public Health Association.
  Iris made her mark during what I call ``movement time&#x27;&#x27;, a period 
when Black Americans were greatly moving out of the shadows of society. 
As I mentioned earlier, Dr. Shannon was not loud, but she was proud and 
as black as the ace of spades, if you know what I mean.
  Iris possessed Black pride, expressed Black principles, stood up for 
Black people and exuded Black excellence. Iris was a caring and 
wonderful nurse, a great scholar, teacher and administrator, a 
visionary leader and an amazing friend.
  I am so glad to have known and worked with her. Dr. Iris Shannon was 
a role model to so many and will be missed by the multitudes, but her 
legacy of service shall endure.
