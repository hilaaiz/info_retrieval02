  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Catholic Schools Week 
across the Nation, we come together to recognize and honor the profound 
impact of Catholic education. On January 31st, we marked National 
Appreciation Day for Catholic Schools, a day that acknowledges the 
enduring commitment of these institutions to educate not only the mind 
but also the soul. Catholic Schools, like St. Ann&#x27;s in Wilmington, 
Delaware where my grandchildren attend, instill faith, academic 
excellence, and service in their students. Together, we are not just 
celebrating a week; we are celebrating the noble mission of Catholic 
education, to educate the whole child and transcend the boundaries of 
traditional learning. God bless our Catholic Schools and God Bless the 
United States of America.
