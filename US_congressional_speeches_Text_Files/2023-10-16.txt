     INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JUROR PAY PARITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 16, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I introduce the District 
of Columbia Juror Pay Parity Act, which would require D.C.&#x27;s local 
trial court, the Superior Court, to pay jurors the same amount federal 
courts pay jurors. Currently, the Superior Court pays jurors the same 
amount as federal jurors, but the Superior Court has sometimes paid 
less.
  Under the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government 
Improvement Act of 1997, Congress assumed responsibility for funding 
the local D.C. courts. The local D.C. courts, however, have always been 
under the direct control of Congress, even when they were funded by 
D.C. The D.C. Home Rule Act prohibits the D.C. Council from enacting 
any law with respect to any provision of Title 11 of the D.C. Code. 
Under Title 11, the Board of Judges of the Superior Court sets juror 
pay.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

    RECOGNIZING CHIEF JEFF GREGORY&#x27;S SERVICE TO THE PATTERSON FIRE 
                     DEPARTMENT UPON HIS RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN S. DUARTE

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 16, 2023

  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Fire 
Chief Jeff Gregory for his dedicated service to the Patterson Fire 
Department and, at this moment, celebrate his thoroughly earned 
retirement.
  Chief Gregory was raised in the Modesto area and has lived in 
Patterson since 1979. He is married and has two daughters. His 
involvement in the fire service began as a firefighter with the 
Patterson Volunteer Fire Department in June of 1986. Chief Gregory 
worked his way up through the Volunteer Fire Service ranks and became a 
Volunteer Captain on September 1, 2001. In December, he was promoted 
again to Volunteer Battalion Chief. On May 1, 2003, his full-time fire 
service career began when he was hired by the City of Patterson Fire 
Department, in a partnership with the West Stanislaus Fire Protection 
District, as the Division Chief. In this new role, Chief Gregory&#x27;s 
duties included training coordination, facilities maintenance, and 
overseeing the purchasing, maintenance, and repair of the fire 
apparatus and emergency equipment.
  Chief Gregory was ultimately appointed as the permanent Fire Chief on 
September 21, 2016. Throughout his tenure as Fire Chief, he has had 
numerous accomplishments and achievements that have improved the 
delivery of fire, rescue, and emergency medical services to Western 
Stanislaus County. One of his successes includes improving and 
expanding the Patterson Fire Department&#x27;s Advanced Life Support Program 
to ensure that both city fire stations and assigned apparatus have 
advanced life support equipment available to on-duty Fire Paramedics. 
Chief Gregory has also been instrumental in modernizing the fire fleet 
and emergency equipment for the City of Patterson and West Stanislaus 
Fire Agencies. Chief Gregory&#x27;s vision for the fire service has 
significantly improved the force and has also had a positive impact on 
his community.
  During the Covid-19 Pandemic, Chief Gregory would often work or 
remain on-call for over 100 hours per week to ensure that everyone in 
the City of Patterson or the West Stanislaus Fire District would 
receive help when they called 911 for assistance.
  Chief Gregory&#x27;s commitment to public service, spanning 37 years, is 
truly commendable. Every day, he tirelessly strived to serve the people 
of his community--sometimes at the expense of his own personal time and 
comfort. His service will be greatly missed by his community and 
everyone who worked alongside him.

                          ____________________

     RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION AT 
                  CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, FRESNO

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. KEVIN McCARTHY

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 16, 2023

  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 
100th Anniversary of Engineering Education at California State 
University, Fresno. Since its founding, the Lyles College of 
Engineering at Fresno State has prepared the Central Valley&#x27;s 
engineering workforce by providing a quality education for college 
students.
  The origin of Fresno State&#x27;s engineering programs dates back to the 
1922-1923 academic year, when Professor Herbert Wheaton was hired as 
the university&#x27;s first civil engineering instructor with 35 students 
enrolled in the program. In the decades to come, the College of 
Engineering would only continue to expand with the emergence of the 
civil engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering 
programs. Fresno State launched its geomatics engineering program in 
1979, which became the first accredited professional geomatics program 
in the United States to prepare students for careers in surveying and 
engineering related to the earth&#x27;s surface. Today, the Lyles College of 
Engineering offers a comprehensive set of seven undergraduate degree 
programs, including architectural studies, civil engineering, computer 
engineering, construction management, electrical engineering, geomatics 
engineering, and mechanical engineering, as well as five graduate 
degree programs.
  Over the past 100 years, Fresno State has educated tens of thousands 
of engineering students and has contributed to the development of a 
highly skilled engineering workforce for California and the nation. 
Fresno State graduates have made great strides in the Central Valley, 
the United States, and around the world. Today, over 60 percent of its 
students are the first to attend college in their families.
  Lyles College has produced presidents and CEOs of large corporations, 
astronauts, entrepreneurs, designers, construction managers, engineers, 
and innovators who have served in both public and private sectors. 
Notable alumni include: Sam Iacobellis, an icon of the aerospace 
industry who led the manufacturing of the B-1 bomber during the Cold 
War; James Kardach, a tech innovator who contributed greatly towards 
the development of the Bluetooth standard; and Colonel Rick Husband, 
astronaut and commander of the U.S. Space Shuttle Columbia. A total of 
26 alumni from Lyles College have been honored with Fresno State&#x27;s 
distinguished Top Dog Alumni.
  Today, Lyles College is an essential part of educating the future 
workforce and preparing students with the technological skills required 
to succeed. In addition to its impact on the students it serves, the 
Lyles College of Engineering has strong partnerships with local and 
regional industry groups and government agencies, and it is a catalyst 
for regional economic development.
  Lyles College has contributed valuable research in areas such as 
transportation, structural engineering, water technologies, deep space 
networks, and agricultural technologies. At the dawn of its second 
century, Lyles College is well positioned for growth in innovation, 
research, and academic programs, and it will continue its leadership 
and impact in the greater San Joaquin Valley of California and beyond.
  On behalf of the 20th Congressional District of California, I would 
like to congratulate the students, faculty, staff, and leadership at 
the Lyles College of Engineering for 100 successful years of 
engineering education at California State University, Fresno, and know 
that Fresno State will continue to be integral in graduating the next 
century of innovators of our Valley, State and Nation.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Monday, October 16, 2023

  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to express my 
sincere appreciation to Mr. Gary Carpenter for the excellent 
professional and dedicated service he has rendered as the Congressional 
Liaison for the United States Air Force Academy for the past 18 years.

[[Page E978]]

  He previously served his country in the U.S. Air Force from 1982 to 
2004, as an active-duty enlisted Public Affairs Specialist for the U.S. 
Northern Command/NORAD and the Uniformed Services University. The 
productive and collaborative relationships he has fostered between the 
USAFA Directorate of Admissions and congressional offices across the 
nation will be greatly missed. I have no doubt Mr. Carpenter will leave 
USAFA in good hands. His accomplishments attest to his integrity, 
quality of character and his dedication to the institution and country 
which he has served with such honor.
  It has been the privilege of my staff to work with him and his office 
throughout the years on behalf of potential Air Force Academy 
candidates from Texas. As he moves on to new challenges, Mr. Carpenter 
has had a tremendous and positive impact on the futures of thousands of 
students and military leaders.
  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, I extend my warmest regards to Gary Carpenter on a job 
well done and wish him all the very best in the future. He has our 
thanks and gratitude.
