          CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF ROSEMARY ENRICO

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. PAT FALLON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and 
service of Mrs. Rosemary Margo Enrico of Dallas, Texas, who peacefully 
passed away on May 6, 2025.
  Rosemary was born on September 28, 1944, in Chisholm, Minnesota, to 
Andrew and Rose Margo. She graduated from Marquette University in 1967 
with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in marketing. For 48 years, she was married to 
her childhood sweetheart, Roger Anthony Enrico, and they raised a large 
family with many children. Rosemary was a devout Catholic, 
schoolteacher, and generous philanthropist. Along with Roger, they 
founded the nonprofit Roger and Rosemary Enrico Foundation to support 
Catholic initiatives and provide life-changing scholarships to many 
economically disadvantaged students in North Texas.
  In her free time, Rosemary was passionate about the arts and was an 
avid traveler. She enjoyed spending time with her family and traveling 
around the world with Roger. I am deeply saddened to hear of Rosemary&#x27;s 
passing, as she brought compassion, kindness, and warmth with her 
presence wherever she went. The incredible impact she has made on our 
community will be remembered and felt for many years to come.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol in recognition of Rosemary&#x27;s life and contributions to North 
Texas. She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who 
knew her.

University. For many years, he worked as a congressional researcher for 
the Department of Agriculture and the Library of Congress. Afterwards, 
Alan taught Economics at Texas A&amp;M University and spent some time 
teaching in Armenia. In addition to his passion for teaching, Alan 
enjoyed hunting, gardening, taking care of his dogs, and telling good 
stories to those around him.

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate 
Illinois Fourth District Appellate Court Justice, James ``Jim&#x27;&#x27; Knecht, 
as he reaches the milestone of serving 50 years as a judge.
  Jim was born in Lincoln, Illinois in 1944 and graduated from Lincoln 
Community High School in 1962. Afterwards, he attended Illinois State 
University and earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Illinois 
College of law in 1973. While in law school, Jim was an editor of the 
Law Review and was honored as a member of the prestigious national law 
school honors society, the Order of the Coif.
  Jim began his judicial career as a law clerk to Illinois Supreme 
Court Justice Robert C. Underwood before serving as an Associate 
Circuit Judge for 3 years and as a Circuit Judge for 8 years. In 1986, 
Judge Knecht was elected to the Illinois Fourth District Appellate 
Court. Currently, he is the longest serving judge in Illinois court 
history and an accredited leader within the Illinois law community. He 
is a member of the Illinois State and McLean County Bar Associations, 
the American Judicature Society, the Illinois Judges&#x27; Association, the 
Appellate Lawyers Association, and is a fellow of the Illinois Bar 
Foundation.
  Outside of the courtroom, Judge Knecht is heavily involved in our 
Illinois communities and within his alma maters. He serves on the 
Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council and on the National 
Advisory Board of the Corporate Alliance to End Partner Violence. 
Additionally, he spent time as an adjunct professor at both Illinois 
State University and the University of Illinois College of Law. At 
Illinois State University, his time as an adjunct professor lasted 
nearly three decades and he is a recipient of their Distinguished 
Alumni Award.
  I want to congratulate Judge Knecht on this momentous achievement and 
thank him for his continued service to the state of Illinois. I wish 
Judge Knecht, his wife Ruth, their children and grandchildren many 
years of happiness and success in the future.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal Dennis C. 
Zavada USMC

[[Page E723]]

(Ret.), a proud United States Marine, Vietnam veteran, and the devoted 
parent of a U.S. military veteran. Mr. Zavada has served his country 
not only in uniform, but also through his unwavering dedication to 
preserving the Fallen Hoosier Heroes Memorial in Westfield, Indiana.
  Since 2009, Mr. Zavada has volunteered his time and labor to care for 
this living tribute to 210 Indiana service members, who lost their 
lives in the wars following September 11. The Memorial was founded by 
fellow Vietnam Veteran Command Sergeant Major Donald E. Peed, who 
initially placed white crosses on his property to honor the fallen. 
What began as a few simple crosses grew each year, becoming a powerful 
community landmark. The first cross honored Marine Sergeant Jeanette 
Winters, the first woman killed in combat during Operation Enduring 
Freedom. The most recent cross honors Marine Corporal Humberto Sanchez, 
who was killed outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan during the 2021 
withdrawal.
  Mr. Zavada has devoted hundreds of hours to maintaining the Memorial. 
He mows the grass, clears snow in winter, salts the walkways, replaces 
worn flags, and commissions plaques for newly fallen heroes. Beyond 
upkeep, he has become a steward of memory--sharing the stories behind 
each cross and ensuring that every name is remembered with dignity.
  Each spring, local elementary school students visit the Memorial, 
where Mr. Zavada teaches them about the service and sacrifice 
represented there. Through his words and care, young people learn the 
deep cost of freedom and the value of honoring those who gave 
everything.
  Local businesses support his work anonymously, providing funds for 
flagpole upgrades, flowers, and supplies. The Carmel VFW also 
contributes to maintenance and expenses, helping preserve this hallowed 
ground.
  On behalf of Indiana&#x27;s 5th District, I thank Corporal Dennis Zavada 
for his honorable service in Vietnam, his continued care for the Fallen 
Hoosier Heroes Memorial, and his lasting contributions to the community 
and the country.

                       HONORING DR. BARBARA NEMKO

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. 
Barbara Nemko, Ph.D., on the occasion of her retirement after 28 years 
as Napa County Superintendent of Schools and a lifetime of service to 
education.
  Dr. Nemko was born in the Bronx, New York, where her journey in 
education began. She earned her Bachelor of Arts and Master&#x27;s degrees 
from Queens College, and started her career as a second-grade teacher 
in New York City. Her academic work continued at the University of 
California, Berkeley, where she earned her Ph.D. in Reading and 
Evaluation of School Programs in 1981, a milestone that also began her 
love affair with California.
  After joining the Napa County Office of Education in 1991, Dr. Nemko 
was appointed as the Napa County Superintendent of Schools in 1997, and 
later elected to the position in 1998. Dr. Nemko held this role for an 
unprecedented 28 years. At the time of her retirement, Dr. Nemko was 
the longest-serving county superintendent in office in our state. Her 
tenure transformed Napa County&#x27;s education system, establishing the 
Office of Education as a regional leader in early learning, special 
education, career technical education, mental health services, and 
professional development for educators.
  Dr. Nemko was known for her forward-thinking leadership, particularly 
in advancing educational technology. She was an early advocate for 
closing the digital divide, securing technology and internet access for 
thousands of students in Napa County. She pioneered programs like the 
Superintendent&#x27;s Fund to provide children with eyeglasses, orthotics, 
and other critical needs not covered by existing budgets.
  Her leadership has extended beyond the classroom. Dr. Nemko served on 
the Community Corrections Board and Juvenile Justice Committee for her 
entire tenure as Superintendent, completed Leadership Napa Valley in 
1999, and later joined its Board of Directors. She also served as 
President of the Rotary Club of Napa from 2013 to 2014. In recognition 
of her advocacy, she was named Woman of the Year for the 7th Assembly 
District by the California Legislature in 2009, received the Public 
Policy Advocate Award from the International Society for Technology in 
Education in 2014, and earned the Platinum Disk Award from Computer 
Using Educators in 2019.
  Beyond her professional accomplishments, Dr. Nemko is deeply 
committed to her family

[[Page E724]]

and the arts. She has performed in numerous community theater 
productions with Dreamweavers, Lucky Penny, and Valley Players. She is 
married to Dr. Marty Nemko, an accomplished career coach, author, and 
writer. Together they raised their daughter, Amy Zubrensky, who served 
as a researcher in the Clinton White House, earned her law degree from 
Yale, and now serves as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. 
Department of Justice. Dr. Nemko and her husband are the proud 
grandparents of Lea and Sara Zubrensky.
  Mr. Speaker, for nearly three decades, Dr. Barbara Nemko has 
dedicated herself to strengthening Napa County&#x27;s education system and 
enriching her community. It is fitting and proper that we recognize her 
extraordinary career, leadership, and service here today.

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to a courageous advocate, passionate man of faith and service, 
and devoted son, partner, and friend--Robert (Bobby) Edward 
Pietrangelo. We honor Bobby following his passing on January 3. 2025.
  Born on December 14, 2001, in Abington, Pennsylvania, Bobby entered 
the world showcasing true strength and resilience. He spent the first 
five and a half weeks of his life in the neonatal unit, but he quickly 
grew to be the smart, funny, and compassionate person his family and 
friends cherished.
  Bobby attended Upper Moreland schools and Pennridge High School, 
where he excelled in the honors and gifted programs, even taking 
college courses at Bucks County Community College while still in high 
school. His talents also shone through his musical ability. By playing 
the trombone and trumpet, competing in jazz competitions, and singing 
every song he knew. Bobby expressed his passion and creativity with 
infectious enthusiasm.
  Beyond the classroom and his love for music. Bobby grew up serving 
his community. After years of dedication with Boy Scout Troop 354. he 
became an Eagle Scout--just one example of his passion for leadership 
and service. He also volunteered as a firefighter for the Silverdale 
and Perseverance Fire Company in Souderton, Pennsylvania.
  Bobby continued his devoted service into his young adulthood. In 
April 2022, Bobby traveled to Ukraine to support humanitarian relief 
efforts. On this noble mission, he initially assisted in rescuing and 
recovering the injured and deceased from bombed civilian areas, 
including a maternity ward. Working with the Believe Family Foundation, 
he became a combat life-saver trainer to provide aid and deliver 
medical supplies to the front lines.
  In June 2024, Bobby courageously enlisted in the Ukrainian military--
standing shoulder to shoulder with brave Ukrainian men and women to 
defend Ukraine. He was deployed to the front multiple times, even 
surviving a drone attack in October 2024, which left him with a severe 
concussion and brain injury. Despite this, Bobby returned to the fight 
as soon as he was medically able--once again showcasing his true 
determination and spirit.
  In an effort to defend Pokrovsk from Russian invasion, Bobby gave his 
life to protecting the people of Ukraine. A true hero, he was a man who 
transformed his values into action--exhibiting resilience and valor in 
every chapter of his journey.
  It is with profound respect that I honor Bobby&#x27;s memory. I send my 
heartfelt condolences to all who had the privilege of knowing him.

    INTRODUCTION OF A RESOLUTION REAFFIRMING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE 
                   CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today I introduced a House resolution 
along with my colleague, Representative Lizzie Fletcher (TX-08), to 
reaffirm the principles of the Constitution of the United States of 
America, including the separation of powers, checks and balances, the 
independence of the judiciary, and the power of Congress to control 
spending, declare war, and conduct oversight. This resolution also 
reaffirms the key individual protections enshrined in the Constitution, 
including due process and equal protection under the law.
  This resolution comes six months into President Donald Trump&#x27;s second 
term, a period which has been marked by escalating erosions of 
constitutional norms and executive overreach by his administration.
  Article I of the Constitution grants Congress broad powers, including 
the power to declare war, regulate commerce, raise revenue, appropriate 
funds and conduct oversight. For decades, Congress has gradually ceded 
more of these Constitutional responsibilities to the executive branch. 
As our country&#x27;s founders warned, this has created a dangerous 
situation ripe for Presidential abuse. It is essential that Congress 
reclaim its legitimate authority as the first branch of government.
  My resolution declares that appropriations made by Congress are law, 
not mere suggestions. It quotes James Madison, who said ``this power 
over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and 
effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate 
representatives of the people.&#x27;&#x27; I urge my colleagues to hear this 
message today.
  This resolution is endorsed by more than a dozen public interest and 
legal advocacy organizations, who stand united in reasserting the 
essential roles of the legislative and judicial branches and in 
declaring unequivocally that no individual--especially the President--
is above the law.
  This resolution affirms what should be nonpartisan truths: that the 
separation of powers is vital for a functioning republic, that Congress 
controls the public purse, and that the rule of law and the protection 
it affords are for everyone. In the face of escalating threats to our 
constitutional order, Congress must not remain silent. This resolution 
is a declaration of principle and a call to action.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of the House to cosponsor this 
important resolution.

  RECOGNIZING LAKE COUNTY SCHOOLS ON EARNING AN ``A&#x27;&#x27; RATING FROM THE

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to 
recognize Lake County Schools in Lake County, Florida, for their 
outstanding achievement in earning an ``A&#x27;&#x27; rating from the Florida 
Department of Education for the 2024-2025 school year.
  Lake County Schools currently operates 49 schools, serving students 
from pre-kindergarten through grade 12, with approximately 48,285 
students and 2,696 teachers. This marks the first time since 2008 that 
the Lake County School District has earned this prestigious 
distinction, reflecting the district&#x27;s unwavering commitment to 
academic excellence, student achievement, and community support.
  Under the leadership of Superintendent Diane Kornegay and the 
dedicated members of the Lake County School Board, the district earned 
this ``A&#x27;&#x27; rating by achieving a high percentage of points based on 
student performance across a wide range of academic indicators. These 
include standardized assessments in English Language Arts, Mathematics, 
Science, and Social Studies, as well as learning gains in English 
Language Arts and Mathematics.
  Among the most notable improvements were a 15 percent increase in 
Algebra 1 proficiency, a 7 percent increase in English Language Arts 
for grades 9 and 10, a 4 percent overall increase in English Language 
Arts scores, and a 4 percent improvement in Civics end-of-course exam 
performance. Additionally, the district proudly reports a high school 
graduation rate of 93 percent, a significant achievement that speaks 
volumes about the commitment of the students, educators, and families 
of Lake County.
  I am pleased to join our community in congratulating the teachers, 
administrators, support staff, and especially the students of Lake 
County Schools for their hard work, diligence, and determination in 
making this achievement possible. I thank them for their continued 
pursuit of educational excellence.

                        RECOGNIZING PAIGE KITTS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Ms. SCHOLTEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Paige Kitts. Paige is a member of Girl Scouts of 
Michigan Shore to Shore, Troop 4504. She has exemplified extraordinary 
leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a demonstrated commitment 
to making a lasting, positive impact by earning the most prestigious 
award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.
  Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing 
to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities with 
measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn the Girl 
Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify and 
investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead a 
team of experts and community members to implement a project that 
produces lasting change. Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award 
Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and 
leadership, distinguishing them from their peers. Through their 
resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to 
truly make the world a better place.
  Paige&#x27;s project, ``Growing Hope&#x27;&#x27;, in partnership with Growing Roots, 
addressed the challenge of finding accessible programs and 
opportunities for those with disabilities in our community. Paige took 
action by designing and building a wheelchair-accessible garden bed to 
help existing programs become more inclusive. She created an 
instruction manual to share with other organizations, providing a 
supply list, step-by-step instructions for building, and insights 
regarding the benefits of wheelchair-accessible garden beds. This 
project will have a positive impact on our community for years to come.
  On behalf of Michigan&#x27;s 3rd Congressional District, congratulations 
to Paige Kitts for achieving the highest distinction in Girl Scouting, 
the Gold Award. We thank Paige for her leadership and for making such a 
positive, enduring change in our community.

                          ____________________

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. AARON BEAN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a heavy heart, 
but a grateful spirit, to honor the life of my friend, Commissioner 
Carrol Eugene Franklin, who passed away peacefully in Hilliard, 
Florida, at the young age of 76. Born in Booneville, Mississippi, 
Carrol lived a life shaped by hard work, deep faith, and a quiet but 
profound dedication to others.
  He was a proud combat veteran who served in the U.S. Army&#x27;s 9th 
Infantry Division during the Vietnam War. That same courage and resolve 
stayed with him throughout his life, whether it was in service to his 
country, in business, or in leadership with the Nassau County Ocean 
Highway &amp; Port Authority.
  Carrol was a man who showed up--not just when it was easy, but when 
it was needed. He believed in faith, integrity, and perseverance. He 
loved his family dearly. And for 42 years, he stood side by side with 
his beloved wife, Judy, raising their sons, Garrett and Greg, and 
cherishing their granddaughter, Diana Del.
  To his church family at First Baptist of Boulougne, his brothers and 
sister, and his many friends, nieces, nephews, and neighbors who knew 
him--Carrol was the kind of man whose legacy is etched not in 
headlines, but in the lives he lifted.
  Mr. Speaker, we say goodbye to a veteran, a man of character, a 
family man, and my friend. It hurts, because that&#x27;s the impact that 
Carrol has had on so many. May his memory continue to inspire us all to 
serve with heart, live with purpose, and love without hesitation.

                          ____________________

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. CHRISTOPHER R. DELUZIO

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and 
memory of my constituent, James Anthony Vitale, who passed away 
recently at the age of 66.
  Mr. Vitale was a dedicated civic leader in Moon Township.
  He was a dedicated public servant, serving on the Moon Township Board 
of Supervisors for nearly 18 years, holding the positions of Chairman 
or Vice Chairman for 11 of those years.
  And he was committed to his community, representing the township on 
the Board of Directors of the South Hills Area Council of Governments 
for 15 years.
  Public service was in Jim Vitales&#x27; bones.
  In Western Pennsylvania, a life like his--devoted to his family and 
community--shows exactly who we are.
  Humble, proud, and always ready to do our part: Jim embodied the very 
best of Western Pennsylvania values: hard work, service, and 
dedication.
  I am holding Jim&#x27;s wife, Luanne Vitale, his family, and his entire 
community in my heart as we celebrate his life and mourn his passing.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. WESLEY BELL

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 23, 2025

  Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember the Honorable 
William Lacy Clay, Sr.
  ``We have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent 
interests.&#x27;&#x27;
  Our country lost a trailblazer. Congressman Clay passed away after a 
lifetime of service that reshaped St. Louis and our Nation.
  Already a civil rights icon before he was elected, he didn&#x27;t come to 
Washington to play politics. He came to fight for working people, Black 
families, union members, and those too often left out and unheard. He 
carried their voices into this chamber and made sure they echoed.
  Bill Clay was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
I--and so many others--would not be here without the doors he opened 
and the example he set.
  I&#x27;m holding his son, my friend and predecessor Lacy Clay, the entire 
Clay family, and the St. Louis community in my prayers.
