      CELEBRATING FULTON UNITED SOCCER CLUB&#x27;S FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 15, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Fulton 
United Soccer Club in Gloversville, New York and congratulate them on 
their fifty-year anniversary.
  The Fulton United Soccer Club is a nonprofit soccer league that has 
given students from Pre-K to 7th grade an opportunity to play soccer 
since 1975 and currently has 544 children signed up to participate in 
the club&#x27;s spring season. Students are coached in a wide range of 
soccer skills from teamwork to advanced ball coordination by parent 
volunteers, many of whom were players themselves.
  The legacy of this recreational soccer league is truly admirable and 
contributes to our district through its commitment to providing 
athletic opportunities to our youth, which is made possible by the 
enthusiasm and generosity of members of our community.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I would like to 
acknowledge and appreciate the Fulton United Soccer Club for its 
tremendous positive impact on so many children in our communities for 
so many years.

                          ____________________

located in El Paso, Texas.
  The Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Veterans Home opened its doors to

  Ambrosio Guillen Home has provided quality and outstanding care to 
thousands of distinguished veterans, ensuring that a welcoming, safe,

social needs, along with treatment plans that prioritize creativity and 
expression.
  I am incredibly thankful to the medical professionals and staff of 
the Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Home for their dedication and tireless 
work to provide care and attention to our veterans and their families. 
The long-term care facility would not be what it is today without them.
  I ask all Members to join me today in honoring the Ambrosio Guillen 
Texas State Veterans Home for their 20 years of service and their 
profound support to our Texas Veterans and families.

                         Tuesday, July 15, 2025

  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and recognize the 
Minnesota Frisbee Association (MFA) on their 50th anniversary. Since 
their founding on July 19, 1975, the Minnesota Frisbee Association has 
been recognized nationally and internationally as one of the most 
innovative and successful flying disc clubs.
  The Minnesota Frisbee Association has been a trailblazer in 
Minnesota, building a foundation on the principles of education, 
communication, community, and competition. They created the MFA Sport 
Development Grant Program to educate, expand, and increase 
accessibility to the sport across Minnesota. As a result, the grants 
have created a boom in frisbee infrastructure, programing, and 
organizational support across the state.
  The Minnesota Frisbee Association has also partnered with sports 
teams such as the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings, and Minnesota&#x27;s 
ultimate frisbee team, Wind Chill. They have leveraged these 
relationships to engage enthusiasts across the state, host local, 
national, and international competitions, and create a lasting and 
dedicated community among neighbors and athletes.
  Members of the Association can be found competing with their friends 
and neighbors, or in the Hall of Fame for their contributions to the 
sport. This dedication to the flying disc community is seen off the 
field--they engage and uplift their neighbors by donating and 
fundraising for various local and national charitable causes.
  Minnesota Frisbee Association is an example of dedication and passion 
not only to the sport, but also to their community. Please join me in 
celebrating the enduring achievements of Minnesota Frisbee Association 
throughout their 50 years.

                         Tuesday, July 15, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor United States Navy 
veteran John T. Golden, Sr.
  John T. Golden. Sr. was born in the Bronx, New York, on April 11, 
1926. He graduated from Long Beach High School and attended CW Post 
College before enlisting in the U.S. Navy on February 5, 1943. John was 
trained in Diesel Mechanics, Demolitions, and was submarine qualified. 
After beginning his military career as a Fireman, he went on to serve 
as a Motor Mechanics Mate.
  During World War II, John was stationed at forward Naval Amphibious 
Assault bases in England and served aboard an LST ship during the D-Day 
Invasion and subsequent transport operations. Later, he was assigned to 
the transport ship USS General Leroy Eltinge for Operation Magic 
Carpet, which took him to China before being transferred to the USS 
General W.F. Hase, which brought him back to the United States. Upon 
being honorably discharged on March 18, 1946, John was awarded the Good 
Conduct Medal, the Asiatic-Pacific Theater Medal, the European Theater 
Medal, and the WWII Victory Medal.
  Returning to civilian life, John built a family and a distinguished 
career. He married Geraldine K. Wood on September 1, 1951, and together 
they raised five children. John served 20 years with the Nassau County 
Police Department&#x27;s 4th Precinct, working as a Detective in the 
Narcotics and Homicide Divisions. After retiring from the police 
department in 1972, John and Geraldine relocated to the Town of Day, 
New York. He then worked at the International Paper Company in Corinth 
until his retirement in 1988.
  Outside of his professional life, John was deeply engaged in his 
community. He was a member and past Commander of the Hudson-Sacandaga 
VFW Post No. 5836, a member of the William J. Varney American Legion 
Post 862, and the Roosevelt Rod and Gun Club. His commitment to 
veterans&#x27; organizations and community activities reflected his lifelong 
dedication to service.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I am honored to 
recognize World War II Veteran and Motor Mechanics Mate John T. Golden, 
Sr.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Noah Sarnoff, an 
exceptional student-athlete from my district who has been awarded the 
Olympiad Student Athlete by the Jewish War Veterans. Established in 
1972, this award honors the memory of the 11 Israeli athletes 
tragically killed during the Munich Olympics and celebrates the 
academic and athletic excellence of remarkable high school students. 
Noah exemplifies those values. A proud representative of Vineland High 
School, he has consistently excelled both in the classroom and in 
athletics, balancing a demanding academic schedule with a standout 
athletic career. On the soccer field, Noah is a four-year varsity 
player and two-year team captain. He leads with talent, integrity, and 
a spirit of sportsmanship that sets him apart. He treats teammates and 
opponents with respect, leads by example, and represents his school and 
community with pride. His lasting impact comes not only from his 
performance, but from the way he uplifts and inspires those around him. 
Noah truly embodies the spirit and values that the Olympiad Award was 
created to honor. I congratulate Noah, and thank him for making South 
Jersey proud. God bless Noah and God bless our United States of 
America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.

                         Tuesday, July 15, 2025

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Daniel McClave, 
whose extraordinary commitment and character have earned him the 
highest honor in the Boy Scouts of America, the Eagle Scout. Daniel 
began his Scouting journey twelve years ago, steadily advancing through 
the Cub Scout ranks, achieving the rank of Scout in 2019, before his 
resilience, dedication, and selfless service led to the achievement of 
Eagle Scout this past December. Throughout his time in Scouting, Daniel 
earned an impressive 41 merit badges and was awarded four Eagle Palms--
a clear reflection of his extraordinary determination to exceed 
expectations and lead by example. For his Eagle Scout project, Daniel 
transformed a storage room at Clayton High School into a fully 
functional and accessible food bank, ensuring that students and 
families in need had a reliable source of support and nourishment. Even 
after achieving the rank of Eagle, Daniel&#x27;s service did not stop. He 
has continued to give back by serving as an Assistant Scoutmaster and 
Merit Badge Counselor, guiding and mentoring the next generation of 
Scouts with the same wisdom, integrity, and leadership that defined his 
own journey. I congratulate Daniel on this outstanding achievement. His 
leadership, generosity, and commitment to his community are inspiring. 
My district and the Boy Scouts of America are better because of young 
men like him. God bless Daniel and God bless our United States of 
America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.

Michael L. Testa, Sr., a respected attorney and leader from South 
Jersey, who was recently awarded the

[[Page E676]]

CEO Group&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award. Michael is a Managing Partner 
at Testa Heck Testa &amp; White, P.A., and has spent more than five decades 
building a legacy of legal excellence and public service. A certified 
civil and criminal trial attorney, he has been named to the lists of 
New Jersey Super Lawyers and Top Ten Lawyers more than ten times each--
an extraordinary testament to his professional reputation and courtroom 
skill. But Michael&#x27;s impact goes far beyond the courtroom. He has 
dedicated his life to serving the people of South Jersey through 
various municipal and educational roles, including as solicitor for 
Buena Municipal Authorities Association, Deerfield Township, and Rowan 
College of South Jersey. His service on the boards of the 
Rehabilitation Hospital of South Jersey, Sun National Bank, and the 
Landis Theatre Foundation reflects a deep commitment to strengthening 
local institutions and opportunities. Michael&#x27;s legacy is not only 
defined by his distinguished legal career but also by his selfless 
dedication to civic leadership, education, and charitable causes 
throughout Cumberland County. I congratulate Michael on this well-
earned Lifetime Achievement Award, and thank him for his decades of 
service and commitment to South Jersey. May God bless Michael Testa, 
Sr., and may God bless the United States of America, the greatest 
country on the face of the Earth.

                         Tuesday, July 15, 2025

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, one of the most commendable milestones a 
young man can reach is earning the rank of Eagle Scout. This past 
weekend, I had the distinct honor of congratulating Robert Corcoran on 
achieving this prestigious award. Robert&#x27;s journey began in 2012 when 
he earned his first Cub Scout rank of Bobcat. Over the past decade, 
through dedication, perseverance, and strong character, he climbed the 
ranks and ultimately attained the highest honor of Eagle Scout. Along 
the way, Robert earned 34 merit badges, including the Light of Christ 
Award, a testament to his deep and abiding faith in our Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ. For his Eagle Scout project, Robert demonstrated 
compassion and creativity by upcycling 31 insulated coolers into feral 
cat shelters. These shelters were distributed through the Homeward 
Bound Pet Adoption Center, providing warmth and protection to South 
Jersey&#x27;s stray cat population during the harsh winter months. I 
congratulate Robert on this remarkable achievement. With his unwavering 
faith, tireless work ethic, and heart for service, there is no doubt in 
my mind, he will thrive in all his future endeavors. God bless Robert 
and God bless our United States of America, the greatest country on the 
face of the Earth.
