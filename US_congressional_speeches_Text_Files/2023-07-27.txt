         CELEBRATING 15 YEARS OF DEUTSCHE BANK IN JACKSONVILLE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 15th 
anniversary of Deutsche Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. Over the past 15 
years, Deutsche Bank has played an integral role in supporting our 
region&#x27;s thriving financial sector and community.
  While Deutsche Bank&#x27;s roots in America go back to 1872, their 
Jacksonville office began as a small operation in 2008 consisting of 
approximately 100 employees. Since then, the Jacksonville office has 
grown to become Deutsche Bank&#x27;s second largest location in the 
Americas, employing approximately 2,400 talented individuals and 
generating significant local economic activity.
  The Deutsche Bank Jacksonville office is a multi-functional site that 
generates new business and provides client and bank-wide support 
services with a significant presence and expertise in sales and 
trading, anti-financial crime, compliance, technology, cyber security 
services, client onboarding and operational support. In the last 15 
years, the office has created thousands of jobs, financed local 
businesses, and supported many community causes such as public 
education, the arts, combating hunger, work readiness, 
entrepreneurship, and financial literacy.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize and congratulate Deutsche Bank 
for 15 years of operation in Jacksonville. On behalf of Florida&#x27;s 5th 
Congressional District, I wish Deutsche Bank Jacksonville and its staff 
continued success in their future endeavors.

                          ____________________

  COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANNY K. DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, today, I wish to commemorate the 
33rd anniversary of the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, or ADA. This core civil rights law prohibits discrimination 
against Americans with disabilities by requiring public and private 
institutions to provide equal access to goods, services, and 
opportunities, such as employment, public transportation, and 
telecommunication.
  Today, 1-in-4 U.S. adults has a disability that substantially impacts 
life. The law provides a framework to make the United States fully-
accessible to tens of millions of Americans, whether in workplaces, 
housing, schools, transit, or businesses. I applaud the successes that 
the disability advocates have secured over the past decades. We know 
the passage of the ADA law was the beginning and not the end. According 
the Federal Transit Administration, 99 percent of all busses are ADA-
accessible, in contrast to just 65 percent prior to the ADA. However, 
we still have metros, trains, and planes that are not accessible. A 
2020 GAO report found that two-thirds of school districts had 
facilities with barriers that could limit access for people with 
disabilities. We also know that advocates have waged and continue to 
wage the legal battles to improve access to buildings and 
transportation that should have occurred 33 years ago.
  Although disability advocates have secured important accomplishments 
over the past decades, much more is needed to achieve an equitable 
society for Americans with disabilities. Americans with disabilities 
face an unemployment rate of 6.8 percent compared to 3.7 percent for 
their peers without disabilities. According to a new analysis by the 
National Partnership for Women &amp; Families: only 36 percent of

[[Page E740]]

women with disabilities are employed compared to 70 percent of 
nondisabled women; only 31 percent of employed women with disabilities 
are economically secure; and American Indian/Alaska Native and Black 
women with disabilities are the least likely to be employed. These gaps 
reveal unacceptable disparities in employment opportunities. 
Furthermore, Americans with disabilities face barriers to receiving 
quality health care, such as service providers with inadequate training 
on how to properly treat patients with disabilities and medical 
facilities that have yet to make appropriate accommodations. Affordable 
housing, businesses, airplanes, bathrooms, and playgrounds still are 
not uniformly accessible. This restricted access reduces quality of 
life and presents obstacles that none of us should tolerate.
  I am proud that I helped improve health care for those with 
disabilities during my tenure in Congress, including provisions in the 
Affordable Care Act that I championed to encourage community-based 
services for individuals with disabilities. We must continue to work to 
make choice for receiving care in one&#x27;s community mandatory, not just 
optional. People should have the freedom to choose where they live and 
receive care. I am proud that I also have helped strengthen Medicare, 
Medicaid, and ACA marketplace health insurance to improve healthcare 
for Americans, including people with disabilities. For example, a 
recent study by researchers at the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services (Creedon, Zuvekas, Hill, Ali, McClellan, &amp; Day, December 2022, 
Health Services Review, Volume 57, Issue S2) found that adults with 
disabilities who were newly-eligible for Medicaid experienced 
significant increases in health coverage, receipt of primary care 
services, and lower out-of-pocket costs from the federal expansion of 
Medicaid via the Affordable Care Act. Further, the Inflation Reduction 
Act expanded premium tax credits and reduced drug prices to further 
lower healthcare costs.
  I am proud that so many organizations and advocates in Illinois 
actively fight to protect Americans with disabilities. For example, 
Access Living is a Chicago-based, advocacy nonprofit that has worked 
for over 4 decades to increase accessibility to transportation, 
housing, and education. The Legal Council for Health Justice uses legal 
services to dismantle barriers to healthcare and to help individuals 
access services and benefits. Equip for Equality serves as a federally-
mandated legal advocate and watchdog. The Arc of Illinois advocates for 
people with disabilities to so that Illinoisans can fully participate 
in their communities, providing education and advocacy services. 
Chicago ADAPT promotes disability and civil rights, be in through 
housing accessibility, workforce accessibility and equity, or promoting 
community-based care. And, the City of Chicago&#x27;s HomeMod program 
removes barriers to housing by working with home remodeling companies 
to provide home accessibility modifications.
  Every American deserves equal opportunity. The Americans with 
Disabilities Act stands as testament to the determination and 
unrelenting will of thousands of activists, advocates, and 
policymakers. As we celebrate its anniversary, I renew my commitment to 
fight to realize the fundamental right of every American to an 
accessible America.

                         HONORING COLLEEN DOLAN

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent 
Colleen Dolan, from Chicago, for a successful career and to 
congratulate her on her much-deserved retirement.
  Graduating from Lewis University with a degree in sociology and 
psychology, Colleen Dolan entered the workforce in 1975 as a bank 
teller at the First National Bank of Winnetka. After a year, she took 
the first step in what would be an impressively steep climb up the 
human resources corporate ladder as a Profit-Sharing Analyst in 
corporate accounting at the Continental Illinois National Bank. At 
Continental, she held several positions, rising to the rank of Sales 
Director--Personal Banking Relations at the end of her 13-year stint at 
the bank. Along the way, she had two boys, Shaun and Ryan Dolan, and 
instilled confidence in her late father, a Zenith Business Executive, 
that her degrees would be useful in carving out a promising career in a 
field he was only beginning to understand.
  In 1989, Colleen made a considerable leap forward as the U.S. 
Director of Human Resources for Leica Microscope, a position she held 
for 10 years before transitioning into the world of commercial real 
estate: first as the Vice President of Compensation &amp; Benefits for a 
year at Equity Residential before moving to Transwestern, where she 
would spend the last and most fulfilling 23 years of her career. She 
embodied the company&#x27;s purpose statement: empowering good people to do 
extraordinary things together, Colleen started at Transwestern as Vice 
President and ascended to hold the roles of Senior Vice President and 
Executive Vice President before ultimately

[[Page E739]]

joining the C-suite as the Chief Human Resources Officer.
  Of her many achievements and affiliations, Colleen is the proud 
recipient or member of the following: Transwestern Executive Committee 
and Board of Directors, Human Resources Management Association of 
Chicago, American Management Association (AMA), Society of Human 
Resources Management (SHRM), Chicago Compensation Association (CPC), 
Transwestern Founder&#x27;s Award Recipient, Real Estate Forum&#x27;s Women of 
Influence Recipient, Notable Leader in Human Resources by Crain&#x27;s 
Chicago Business, and a member of Transwestern&#x27;s Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion program both at the Steering Committee level and through 
leadership on both the Training and Belonging committees.
  I send my heartfelt congratulations to Colleen Dolan for a career 
spent putting people first, bettering the lives of others, and defining 
company culture based on her principles of inclusion, fairness, and 
deep compassion. I know she is looking forward to spending even more 
time with her grandchildren, Parker, Hadley, and Patch, her sons Shaun 
and Ryan, and their wives Ashley and Lizzie. I am hoping Colleen enjoys 
this time with her family, as she has earned it.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to extend my heartfelt 
congratulations to Israel Nitzan for successfully completing his 
distinguished tenure as the Acting Consul General of Israel in New 
York, a role he has admirably held from 2018 to 2023.
  The Office of the Consul General, or the Lishka, plays a pivotal role 
in fostering strong ties between the State of Israel and influential 
organizations and agencies in the New York Metro area. Throughout his 
tenure, Consul General Nitzan has been instrumental in bolstering 
Israel&#x27;s positive image in the media, while keeping the local community 
abreast of significant developments within the Israeli community and 
political landscape. He has effectively rallied support for Israel, 
inspiring both members and young leaders to take proactive and 
supportive measures for the nation. Additionally, his initiatives in 
organizing missions to Israel and fostering enduring relationships with 
local, state, and national elected officials have proven invaluable in 
enhancing understanding and cooperation between our Nations.
  Beyond his tenure in New York, Consul General Nitzan&#x27;s illustrious 
career has spanned the globe. He notably served as the Spokesperson in 
the Israeli Embassy in Egypt from 2002 to 2005, followed by his role as 
Deputy Chief of Mission from 2009 to 2011. In his subsequent role as 
Minister-Counselor for Political Affairs at the Permanent Mission of 
Israel to the United Nations, Consul General Nitzan represented 
Israel&#x27;s interests before the UN Security Council, effectively 
monitoring and advancing Israeli political engagement and policies 
within the UN system.
  Israel Nitzan&#x27;s dedication and tireless efforts have undeniably 
advanced America&#x27;s relationship with 1 of our closest and strongest 
allies As he concludes this chapter in his career, I extend my sincere 
gratitude for his invaluable contributions. May he be commended for his 
outstanding service, and may his future endeavors continue to be marked 
by success and dedication to the cause of international diplomacy.

  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of my friend, Terry Stone, from International Falls, Minnesota.
  Terry embodied the spirit of northern Minnesota throughout his life. 
He started a radio club while attending Falls High School and later

  He was a local businessman who was actively involved in his 
community, and even served as the president of the local Chamber of 
Commerce.
  Terry also spent time as a volunteer with the International Health 
Service in Honduras where he helped provide medical and dental care to 
those in need. He even used his passion and expertise in radio to help

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Harry 
Edman Sexton, a U.S. Marine Corp Colonel who graduated from my alma 
mater, Anaheim High School, in 1950.
  Born in Anaheim, Colonel Sexton passed away Feb. 15, 2023, after 
living 90 years of a full life that included a distinguished military 
career.
  He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps 2 years after graduating from 
Anaheim High and served for 26 years.
  A Navy Cross awardee, our country&#x27;s second-highest award for bravery, 
Colonel Sexton flew more than 400 combat missions during two tours of 
Vietnam. During his first tour, he commanded the only Marine F-8 
Crusader Fighter Squadron to deploy from Navy Carrier USS Oriskany.
  On his second tour, he commanded a squadron of HMLA-367 ``Scarface&#x27;&#x27; 
Cobra Helicopters, providing air support, day or night, under all 
weather conditions, to Marine ground combat units.
  He received the Navy Cross for heroism during Operation Tailwind as 
he and his fellow ``Scarface&#x27;&#x27; Cobra Gunships engaged the enemy to 
provide cover for the extraction of a nearly overwhelmed force of U.S. 
Army Special Operators out of Laos.
  He was also awarded two Legion of Merits with Combat ``V&#x27;&#x27;, a 
Distinguished Flying Cross, 44 Air Medals/Strike Flight Awards, and was 
inducted into the Golden Eagles for his distinguished career as an 
aviator.
  His wife of 65 years, Ann, son Harry Jr., and daughter Stacie will 
remember him as a husband and father who lived for others, giving 
freely of his time, skill, and love to all who were fortunate enough to 
have known him. He is also survived by 4 grandchildren; and a great 
grandson.
  I thank the Colonel for his service.

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Gerald W. 
Duncan, who passed away on July 10, 2023, after a valiant three-plus 
year fight against Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease.
  After receiving his undergraduate degree from Virginia Tech and a 
master&#x27;s in business administration from Radford University, Mr. Duncan 
began his career in 1967 as a software developer with the Research, 
Development, &amp; Acquisition Information Systems Agency, Department of 
the Army, where he was honored with many awards during his 35 years of 
service.
  He then pivoted careers, being elected as Treasurer of Giles County 
in 2000. His success as Treasurer led him to being voted Treasurer of 
the Year for the State of Virginia. Mr. Duncan loved serving the people 
of Giles County and had an open-door policy during his time as 
Treasurer.
  When not working, Mr. Duncan loved to hunt deer, bears, and turkey 
throughout the country. He was elected president of the Virginia State 
Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation for 3 consecutive terms, 
championing conservation of the wild turkey.
  But most importantly, Mr. Duncan&#x27;s proudest achievement was being a 
husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.
  Mr. Duncan is survived by his wife, Ruth Duncan of Blacksburg; oldest 
son, Troy Duncan and wife, Heather, of New Castle; youngest son, Mark 
Duncan and wife, Eva, of Catawba; daughter, Margee Sisson and husband, 
Dougie, of Shawsville; grandchildren, Haley Chandler of Clearfield, 
Utah, Hagan Chandler and wife, Kierston, of Riner, Tanner Duncan of 
Richmond, Andrew Duncan of New Castle, Elijah Duncan of Catawba, and 
Summer Norwood of Shawsville; great-grandson, Myles Chandler of Riner; 
and great-granddaughter, Everly Chandler of Riner. I wish them 
condolences on the loss of their loved one.
  Mr. Duncan was known by his friends and family as being extremely 
kind and having unwavering determination throughout his life, always 
offering a helping hand to those in need. I know he will be greatly 
missed.

MOURNING THE LOSS OF FORMER MARYLAND STATE SENATOR NORMAN R. STONE, JR.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my dear friend 
former Maryland State Senator Norman R. Stone, Jr., who sadly passed 
away last month at the age of 87. I join many Marylanders and Americans 
in mourning his loss and in giving thanks for his life of service.
  Elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1962 and later to the 
State Senate in 1966, Norman served in the Maryland General Assembly 
for 52 years. We became good friends and close colleagues during our 
time in the State Senate together. He had become the longest-serving 
member of the Maryland General Assembly by the time of his retirement 
in 2015. Not only was the length of Norman&#x27;s tenure admirable, so too 
was his character.
  Norman was 1 of the most steadfast, trustworthy, and honest people 
I&#x27;ve known. Although I did not agree with him on every issue, he never 
judged me or anyone else for a difference in opinion. He was humble and 
forthright--never 1 to resort to showmanship and politicking. You 
always knew where he stood on an issue. And you always knew that Norman 
would do what he thought was right for his constituents. He was truly 
an exemplary legislator.
  Norman showed devotion not only to public service but also to his 
family. My prayers are with his wife of 38 years Joanne; his children 
Norman, David, Jerry, and Lori; his stepson Lennie Lehner, Jr.; his 7 
grandchildren; and the rest of his family. I like so many others 
throughout our community and state, grieve with them.
  I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Norman, who lived a 
life worthy of emulation--a life of service, character, and conviction.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of Philip 
Brunelle, world-renowned conductor, organist, and choral scholar, in 
celebration of his 80th birthday.
  Throughout his life and career, Mr. Brunelle has promoted the choral 
arts in all its forms. At age 19, he became the youngest member of the 
Minnesota Orchestra, and by age 25, he was appointed choirmaster of the 
Plymouth Congregational Church in Minneapolis, MN, a position that he 
still holds today. In 1969 Mr. Brunelle founded VocalEssence, 1 of the 
largest and most prestigious choral organizations in the country. Under 
his leadership, VocalEssence has commissioned more than 300 works to 
date, promoting rarely heard works from the past in addition to 
remarkable new music. VocalEssence has brought great distinction to the 
Twin Cities arts community, earning numerous recognition and awards 
from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, as 
well as the Margaret Hillis Achievement Award for Choral Excellence, an 
outstanding achievement and an unparalleled honor in the choral music 
community.
  Mr. Brunelle is an institution within the choral music community, and 
a brilliant artist in his own right. Mr. Brunelle has conducted 
symphonies across the country, including the New York Philharmonic, the 
Seattle Symphony, and the Minnesota Orchestra, and directed choral 
festivals and operas around the globe. For more than 40 years, Mr. 
Brunelle served as a guest conductor and pianist on American Public 
Radio&#x27;s A Prairie Home Companion, appearing on its first and final 
broadcasts. In 2002, Mr. Brunelle brought choirs from around the world 
to Minnesota for the International Choral Music Symposium, and in 2020, 
he was awarded The American Prize in Choral Conducting and was 
presented with the Honorary Member award by the Society for American 
Music.

  Mr. Brunelle has left an indelible mark on the world of choral music 
globally and at home in Minnesota He has spent his life working 
enthusiastically to foster new talent and to expose new audiences to 
choral and orchestral music of every genre and style We are so 
fortunate to benefit from his boundless talent, and happily, he shows 
no signs of stopping.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to honor Mr. Brunelle today and 
celebrate him on his 80th birthday.

  RECOGNIZING THE 99TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
                                TURKIYE

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Turkish American Cultural 
Association of Michigan, it is my honor to recognize the 99th 
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkiye. For nearly a 
century, Turkiye and the Turkish people have served as a beacon of 
cooperation, democratic ideals, and good citizenship.
  Over the course of my career, I have had the opportunity to travel to 
Turkey, meet with Turkish leaders, and get to know the Turkish-American 
community in Michigan Turkish Republic Day is an annual milestone and 
has been celebrated with great pride and joy since the republic&#x27;s 
founding on October 29th, 1923, by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk By replacing 
an aging empire with a vibrant democratic republic, Turkiye facilitated 
its own modernization and established itself on the National stage, 
including by being an important member of NATO for 70 years. Today, 
Turkiye remains a vital ally--from our work together against terrorist 
organizations, to countering international adversaries like Russia
  In Michigan, the Turkish diaspora community and those of Turkish 
descent have had a lasting impact on our state&#x27;s culture, economic 
development, and education system, and have personified Michigan&#x27;s 
ideal citizen This especially includes the Turkish-American Cultural 
Association of Michigan, which has worked to promote Turkish culture 
and support programs benefitting the welfare of citizens throughout the 
state. The impact of their work on the people and communities of 
Michigan cannot be understated
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Turkish Republic Day and the 
99th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkiye. I join 
with my constituents in celebration with the Turkish people, and wish 
them the best as they venture into the future

    RECOGNIZING WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT JUSTICE PATIENCE ROGGENSACK

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Wisconsin 
Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack&#x27;s 20 years of service on the 
Wisconsin Supreme Court.
  Justice Roggensack&#x27;s legal legacy will be long remembered. She helped 
to guide the court throughout her tenure during some of its most 
important times. She has mentored countless attorneys and judges and 
will continue to serve as an important role model for the next 
generation of judges. She will always serve as their fiercest advocate.
  Justice Roggensack led a historic career. Before serving on the 
Supreme Court, Justice Roggensack served on the Wisconsin Court of 
Appeals for 7 years. She was elected to the Supreme Court in 2003. I 
had the great honor of working for Justice Roggensack shortly after law 
school and saw her dedication to the law, her diligent work ethic, and 
her compassion for serving Wisconsin. Everyone who has worked with 
Justice Roggensack, including myself, has benefited from her 
mentorship.
  12 years after her election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Justice 
Roggensack became the first Justice to be elected by her colleagues in 
the court to the position of Chief Justice. She held the position of 
Chief Justice for 6 years until relinquishing it in 2021. Justice 
Roggensack&#x27;s incredible service, dedication, and outstanding 
accomplishments will be long remembered after her July 31, 2023 
retirement.
  I congratulate Justice Patience Roggensack on her retirement and 20 
years of service to Wisconsin.

 SUPPORTING RESEARCH FUNDING FOR EPITHELIOID HEMANGIOENDOTHELIOMA AND 
                           OTHER RARE CANCERS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JAMIE RASKIN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 27, 2023

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the urgent need 
for research funding for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE). EHE is 
a rare and devastating cancer that can affect anyone of any age and 
that grows in the cells that make up our blood vessels, often appearing 
in the liver, lungs, and bones. This disease is very rare, affecting 
one in one million people, and is also exceedingly difficult to 
diagnose.
  According to the National Cancer Institute, patients suffering from 
EHE often live with severe pain, broken bones, disability, and 
respiratory infections. Studies show that EHE is more common in women, 
but more fatal for men. Because of its status as an exceedingly rare 
form of cancer, there is no standard treatment available and meager 
funding for lifesaving research.
  This rare cancer is extraordinarily difficult to treat and often does 
not respond to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Because there is 
no standard, effective treatment for EHE, many patients must resort to 
organ transplants and undergo a vascular embolization, where doctors 
block the artery supplying blood to the tumor.
  One of my constituents recently lost his beloved cousin, Brianna Rae 
Carney, to this terrible disease. To honor her courageous, selfless 
spirit, he wrote me to encourage this body to raise awareness of EHE 
and invest in robust medical research
  Mr. Speaker, as a cancer survivor who owes my life to the excellent 
and effective medical treatment that I was fortunate enough to receive, 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting increased federal 
support for finding more effective treatments and ultimately a cure for 
this terrible disease.
