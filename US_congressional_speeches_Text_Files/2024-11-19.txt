CONGRATULATING IAN NOEL MERRIMAN AND JEREMY PAUL YOAKAM FOR EARNING THE 
                          RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RYAN K. ZINKE

                               of montana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 19, 2024

  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor two 
exceptional young men from Livingston, Montana, Ian Noel Merriman and 
Jeremy Paul Yoakam, for their remarkable achievements and dedication to 
the principles of Scouting. Their commitment to service, leadership, 
and community exemplifies the values that Scouting instills in young 
men.
  Growing up in Whitefish, Montana, the outdoor and survival skills 
that I learned, as well as the friends I made as a Boy Scout have 
stayed with me to this day. The Eagle Scout Oath to do my best to God, 
to my country, and to scout law is something that set me on the right 
track to serve my country as a SEAL and as Member of Congress. These 
two young men have lived up to that oath and deserve the honor and 
recognition that comes with the Eagle Scout title.
  Ian, a senior at Park High School, began his Scouting journey in the 
Cub Scouts in 2013. He achieved the rank of Webelo Scout and earned the 
Arrow of Light, the highest rank in Cub Scouting, in 2018. 
Transitioning to Boy Scouts in May 2018, Ian has consistently 
demonstrated exceptional leadership and dedication.
  Ian has participated in numerous community service projects, 
including annual ``Scouting for Food&#x27;&#x27; drives, Yellowstone River Clean-
ups, and serving veterans at the American Legion Post No. 23 Veterans 
Day dinner. His involvement in activities such as erecting and taking 
down flags in Sacajawea Park and local cemeteries on significant 
patriotic holidays underscores his commitment to community service.
  For his Eagle Scout Project, Ian raised funds to purchase and install 
two bicycle repair stations on local bike trails, benefiting the 
Livingston Bicycle Club and the community. Ian&#x27;s perseverance, positive 
attitude, and compassion for younger Scouts are truly inspiring.
  Jeremy Paul Yoakam, a senior who splits his education between 
homeschooling and the Learning Bench Academy, also embarked on his 
Scouting journey in 2013. Achieving the Arrow of Light in 2018, Jeremy 
joined Boy Scouts in May 2018 and has since been an active and 
influential member of his troop. His service projects display 
dedication to community improvement, including food drives, river 
clean-ups, and veterans&#x27; support.
  Jeremy&#x27;s Eagle Scout Project involved building two flag collection 
boxes for the community to appropriately dispose of worn flags. This 
project honors the American flag and those who have served, and it 
highlights Jeremy&#x27;s innovative thinking and commitment to service.
  To go along with his excellent academic achievement, Jeremy balances 
his Scouting activities with a rich array of extracurricular pursuits, 
including church youth group, jiu-jitsu, backpacking, hunting, fly-
fishing, and shooting sports. His work at Woodland Ridge Tiny Home 
Crafters speaks to his industrious nature and varied interests.
  Mr. Speaker, the dedication and achievements of Ian Noel Merriman and 
Jeremy Paul Yoakam are commendable. Their contributions to their 
community and Scouting exemplify the best of our young citizens. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in honoring these outstanding young men for 
their exemplary service and leadership.

                                 ______

                       Tuesday, November 19, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Police 
Chief Darren Pytel, upon his retirement after 41 years of service to 
our Davis community. Chief Pytel&#x27;s career exemplifies commitment to 
community, service, and excellence, and his legacy in Davis will 
continue to inspire future generations
  Chief Pytel grew up in Davis, choosing to remain in his hometown, 
where he would ultimately dedicate his life&#x27;s work to enhancing public 
safety and community trust. Chief Pytel earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 
criminal justice at Sacramento State University, and later a Juris 
Doctorate at Lincoln Law School.
  Chief Pytel began his career as a police cadet in 1983 and advanced 
through nearly every rank within the Davis Police Department. He served 
as a bike enforcement officer, police officer, sergeant/watch 
commander, lieutenant, and Assistant Police Chief before being named 
Police Chief in 2015. His leadership has guided the department through 
some of its most challenging moments, including the tragic loss of 
Police Officer Natalie Corona, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the spring 
2023 homicides.
  Throughout his tenure, Chief Pytel led the Davis Police Department 
with a focus on progressive policing, building trust, and fostering 
partnerships with the community. In recognition of Chief Pytel&#x27;s 
innovative approach to policing, he received the Multi-Cultural 
Community Council Administration of Justice Award for establishing the 
Alternative Conflict Resolution process, which allows for peaceful 
conflict mediation and community-based resolution.
  Chief Pytel has also served as an educator, teaching aspiring public 
safety professionals in Sacramento City College&#x27;s Administration of 
Justice Department since 2007. After his retirement from the police 
department, Chief Pytel will continue his teaching role at the college 
while residing in Fair Oaks with his wife, Melissa. Together, they look 
forward to spending more time with their four children and five 
grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, we honor Chief Darren Pytel today for his service, his 
commitment to our Davis community, and the integrity with which he led 
the Davis Police Department. His career and leadership have left an 
indelible mark on our community, and his contributions will continue to 
benefit our city of Davis for years to come. It is truly fitting and 
proper that we recognize Chief Pytel&#x27;s legacy here today.

                                 ______

                       Tuesday, November 19, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Leon 
Garcia, as we celebrate his retirement as American Canyon&#x27;s longest 
serving mayor.
  After moving to American Canyon in 2000, Mr. Garcia quickly began his 
career in public service. In 2002, he was sworn in as a city council 
member, marking the beginning of his service to the community. 
Following his council term, Mr. Garcia made history as American 
Canyon&#x27;s first elected mayor. Known affectionately by his team as the 
`listener-in-chief,&#x27; Mr. Garcia&#x27;s attentive approach earned him 
nineteen years in the mayor&#x27;s office.
  As mayor, Mr. Garcia earned his resident&#x27;s trust by putting them 
first. He promoted healthy growth and expansion measures including 
overseeing the expansion of hundreds of new homes, ushering in 
warehouses in industrial areas, and supporting the Watson Ranch 
wetland&#x27;s trail access initiatives. Mr. Garcia has been a strong 
advocate for the City&#x27;s Broadway District Specific Plan since 2017. 
This project is designed to transform Highway 29 from an auto-oriented 
commercial area into a multimodal town center.
  Beyond his mayoral duties, Mr. Garcia&#x27;s dedication to service extends 
to numerous organizations at local, regional and statewide levels. He&#x27;s 
been an active member of Napa Valley Waste Management Authority, Napa 
County Flood and Water Conservation District, American Canyon Community 
&amp; Parks Foundation, Napa Valley Transportation Authority, Napa County 
League of Governments, Association of Bay Area Governments, the League 
of California Cities North Bay Division, and the Napa Climate Action 
Committee. He has also served on the board of important not-for-profits 
organizations such as the Napa County Hispanic Network and Community 
Action of Napa Valley.
  In his professional career, Mr. Garcia was a registered nurse for 
thirty-four years: twenty-seven at Napa State Hospital and seven at 
Yountville Veterans Home. Mr. Garcia is also a family man. He&#x27;s proud 
of his large, blended family of six adult children, three 
grandchildren, and his lovely wife Eva.
  Over the decades, Mr. Garcia has demonstrated his dedication and 
commitment to American Canyon, and we wish him well in his retirement. 
As such, it is fitting and proper that he be honored for his 24 years 
in public service.

                                 ______

                                   of

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 19, 2024

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague 
Congressman Mike Thompson to honor Terry Lindley in celebration of his 
retirement after thirty years of service on the Sonoma County Junior 
College District Board of Trustees. We commend his outstanding service 
to the students and faculty of the Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC).
  Raised on a family ranch in Humboldt County, Mr. Lindley developed an 
appreciation for farming at an early age. While attending Ferndale High 
School, Mr. Lindley met Steve Olson, his then agriculture teacher who 
went on to become a lifelong friend and mentor. His counsel and 
guidance steered Mr. Lindley to embark on a distinguished career 
focusing on community leadership and agriculture. After graduating high 
school in 1976, Mr. Lindley began studying agribusiness at SRJC.
  After earning his degree, Mr. Lindley was hired as a loan officer and 
appraiser at American AgCredit. Over the course of forty years with the 
company, Mr. Lindley&#x27;s knowledge of agribusiness helped him achieve 
increasingly prominent roles, including senior vice president and chief 
marketing officer. Mr. Lindley&#x27;s aptitude for hard work, deep 
understanding of agriculture and business acumen made him a remarkable 
pioneer in the agribusiness industry. Through his leadership, American 
AgCredit established the first marketing department in all of the Farm 
Credit System.
  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Mr. Lindley has made 
many enduring and positive impacts on the community during his decades 
of public service. For thirty years. Mr. Lindley has been a trustee of 
Sonoma County Junior College District, which oversees SRJC, during 
which he has demonstrated his incredible commitment to providing high-
quality education to generations of students throughout our community 
in the North Bay. While he will be greatly missed in his retirement, 
Mr. Lindley&#x27;s enduring legacy will be remembered through the newly 
opened Lindley Center for STEM Education at SRJC. This new lecture and 
lab hall provides state-of-the-art facilities for hands-on learning in 
the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.
  Mr. Lindley&#x27;s leadership in agriculture and agribusiness education 
has not gone unnoticed by our community leaders. He has been awarded 
numerous accolades in recognition of his service including the SRJC&#x27;s 
President&#x27;s Medallion, the 4-H Foundation&#x27;s Shining Star Award, the 
Spirit of Sonoma County Award, and Sonoma County&#x27;s North Bay Rancher of 
the Year award.
  Mr. Speaker, it is evident that Mr. Lindley has been an excellent 
steward of Santa Rosa Junior College and a dedicated community member 
of Sonoma County&#x27;s agricultural community. Therefore, it is fitting and 
proper that we honor him here today.

                   MOURNING THE LOSS OF DON VALPREDO

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 19, 2024

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of my friend 
Donald John Valpredo, a respected member of our community and a pillar 
of modern agriculture.
  Mr. Valpredo passed away on October 31, 2024, at the age of 85, 
leaving behind a remarkable legacy of leadership, determination,

[[Page E1166]]

and family pride. Whether through the many companies he founded and 
managed or as a respected horseman, Don&#x27;s loss is deeply felt by all 
who knew him.
  Born on January 5, 1939, to Jeanne and John Valpredo of Mettler, 
California, Don inherited a proud Italian heritage, fitting his later 
affectionate moniker of ``The Don&#x27;&#x27; or ``El Don.&#x27;&#x27; His father had 
likely been the first pioneer to drill deep enough to find water in the 
Mettler area and the Valpredos established their roots there. After Don 
graduated from Garces Memorial High School, he then attended the 
University of California, Davis, where he graduated with a degree in 
Agronomy. He then went to serve our country in the U.S. Coast Guard, 
which, coupled with its premier academic training, provided a firm 
foundation to become a true visionary of agricultural excellence in 
Kern County.
  Returning to Mettler after his service, Don partnered with his 
father, John, in farming. Don was gifted and soon found himself serving 
in a variety of executive roles. He served as President of Ridge 
Ginning Company and became an aggressive entrepreneur by founding Kern 
Ridge Growers, Val-Mar Farms, Bako Sweet, and Country Sweet Produce, 
among other companies. As a mark of the prevailing Valpredo family 
legacy, Don&#x27;s son, Michael, was also a founder of Country Sweet Produce 
and continues to serve as its President. Under Don&#x27;s leadership, his 
farms have grown to now produce over 20 crops year-round across 
thousands of acres. His businesses today are marked by innovations like 
water conservation, recycling, and employee co-ownership.
  Nor can we forget Don&#x27;s lifelong passion for horses, which adhered to 
him after the first horse he bred won her first race. Don&#x27;s leadership 
within the horseracing industry shaped the California 
ThoroughbredBreeders Association (CTBA). Don served as CTBA President 
four times and once as chairman. In 2017, Don was inducted into the 
CTBA Hall of Fame for his forty years dedicated to building the sport 
and the California Cup Sprint. His work in helping to establish the 
California Cup Sprint--which was later renamed in his honor and is held 
at Santa Anita Park every January--stands as a lasting tribute to his 
leadership in developing this industry and racing community in 
California. Don served as a Commissioner and Vice-Chairman of the 
California Horse Racing Board, director of the Thoroughbred Owners of 
California for thirteen years, and served on the board of directors of 
the Breeders&#x27; Cup. Yet Don was not only a leader in equine 
associations, but also a winner of competitions. Don&#x27;s `Soviet Problem&#x27; 
won Calbred Horse of the Year in 1994, and he would always look back 
fondly on his time with that special steed.
  Don is survived by his wife Sally, son Michael, daughters Natalia 
Fritz and Alexis Mosely, and seven grandchildren. Amanda and I send our 
condolences to this incredible family who have lost a great patriarch 
and leader.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me as we celebrate Don 
Valpredo&#x27;s amazing life and legacy. From the fields of Mettler to the 
racetrack at Santa Anita Park, Don Valpredo will be dearly missed.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, this past September, I had the honor of 
commemorating the historic 100th Anniversary of the Oceanville 
Volunteer Fire Company, a milestone that marks decades of exceptional 
service to our community. Oceanville Fire is the oldest fire department 
in Galloway Township, established in 1924 by local community members. 
These visionary individuals, primarily farmers and shell-fishermen, 
recognized the urgent need for fire protection and rescue services. 
Their selfless dedication set the foundation for the department we know 
today. The department, now consisting of 39 men and women, continues to 
serve the township with unwavering commitment. Their dedication as 
extraordinarily well-trained firefighters echoes the spirit of the 
founding members many years ago, providing a sense of security to the 
township. Through the years, Oceanville Fire has proven to be a vital 
part of the community and has played a crucial role in making its 
residents feel safe. I am deeply grateful to the Oceanville Volunteer 
Fire Company for their century of great service and may they continue 
to protect and serve for many more. God bless Oceanville Fire 
Department, and God bless our United States of America.

                       Tuesday, November 19, 2024

  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the passing of former 
Mayor Bert Massey of Brownwood, Texas on November 13, 2024. Mr. Massey 
was born in Brownwood on October 3, 1943, and he was a pillar of 
leadership in his community throughout his life. Mayor Massey graduated 
from Brownwood High School and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts from 
the University of Texas in August 1967, followed by a Doctor of 
Jurisprudence from the University of Texas School of Law in January 
1969. He served on the District Court for the Northern District of 
Texas and the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
  Mr. Massey served on the city council from 1978 to 1984 and as Mayor 
of the City of Brownwood from 1984 to May 2010, while practicing law as 
a partner for Massey &amp; West. As the longest-serving Mayor, Mr. Massey 
was instrumental in countless public infrastructure and quality-of-life 
projects. Among these are the renovations of the Depot Civic and 
Cultural Center, the construction of the Martin &amp; Francis Lehnis 
Railroad Museum, the relocation of City Hall to Center Ave., the 
construction of the Joint Law Enforcement Center, the relocation of the 
Senior Citizens Center, the construction of the Bert V. Massey II 
Sports Complex and the Camp Bowie Family Aquatic Center.
  Along with his years of service to his community, Mayor Massey was a 
devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He was known for his wealth 
of knowledge, engaging stories about his beloved community and his warm 
smile. Mayor Massey&#x27;s dedication to the Brownwood area and love for his 
family will be deeply missed by all. I am proud to honor Mayor Massey&#x27;s 
many incredible contributions to the City of Brownwood, and I extend my 
deepest condolences to his family and all who had the privilege of 
knowing him.

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, William `Will&#x27; John Ostertag was born on 
March 2, 1996, to parents Stephanie Clemans and Jack Ostertag. He was a 
chubby baby with the biggest head anyone had ever seen, covered in 
bright orange hair. Will passed away November 14, 2024, from a sudden 
cardiac arrest. He was 28 years old. Heartbroken isn&#x27;t a big enough 
word.
  Will grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, where he attended St. Francis 
of Assisi Elementary School and St. Xavier High School. When Will was 
two, his brother Thomas came onto the scene. They fought like only 
siblings that close in age know how to. They supported each other in 
the same way.
  Will was a shy but smiley toddler. He grew into a handsome, 
confident, and--to his nerdy family&#x27;s surprise--exceedingly popular 
high schooler. He was a great tennis player, an Eagle Scout, a UK 
basketball superfan, and the host of more than a few unauthorized house 
parties.
  After graduating from Miami University, Will spent two years in 
Indianapolis with the Teach for America program. He earned his master&#x27;s 
degree in education while teaching math at a

middle school sorely in need of smart and caring educators. Mr. 
Ostertag stayed late coaching basketball and track and was a regular 
feature in the kids&#x27; TikToks. In his first year, test scores 
skyrocketed, with 90% of his students far surpassing the school&#x27;s 
average.
  Will thought the point of life was to help people. From campaigning 
with the Montana Democratic Party to working on Capitol Hill, he 
pursued a better future. Most recently, Will worked as an Investment 
Strategy Analyst with the Department of Energy. Coworkers say Will&#x27;s 
ability to create meaningful relationships with all kinds of people 
helped send more than $10 billion toward clean energy initiatives.
  On Halloween night 2021, Will met a girl at a party. He texted a 
friend that she was ``perfect.&#x27;&#x27; Will had always been exceptionally 
bright, so he knew that this girl was way out of his league. He would 
have been delighted to know that Zehra was talking to friends too, 
saying Will was the funniest person she had ever met. At 25, Will had 
found what some people go their whole lives without--he had fallen in 
love and was overjoyed to be loved just as deeply in return.
  Will would have wanted us to thank Andy Samberg, the other members of 
The Lonely Island, and the cast and crew of ``Hot Rod,&#x27;&#x27; for creating 
the building blocks for his sense of humor and, possibly, his entire 
personality. Will routinely made friends and family cry from laughter. 
When he laughed, which was often and easily, he threw his entire head 
back. He was an enthusiastic and surprisingly coordinated dancer. He 
checked in on the people he cared about, celebrated others&#x27; 
accomplishments, and always remembered birthdays. His biggest dream was 
to be a dad--he would have been an amazing one.
  Because Will chose to be an organ donor, he will save lives. The 
people who know him, know this is fitting. Will&#x27;s family would like to 
thank the bystanders who tried to save Will&#x27;s life and all of those who 
cared for him at MedStar Washington Hospital.
  Will is survived by his partner, Zehra Khan; his parents, Stephanie 
Clemans (Mark French) and Jack Ostertag (Lisa Atwell Tong); his 
brother, Thomas Ostertag (Kelly Ostertag); stepsisters, Elizabeth and 
Savanna Tong; his grandmother, Nancy Sandman Ostertag; and many loving 
aunts, uncles, and cousins. He was preceded in death by his 
grandparents, Judy Clemans, Joseph Clemans, and Jerome `Jerry&#x27; William 
Ostertag.
  Will will be remembered most for the way he made people feel--light 
and fun, seen and supported, optimistic, engaged, and cared for. Will 
spent most of his days thinking seriously and meaningfully about how to 
make this world a betterplace. Unfortunately--incomprehensibly--that 
task now falls to those who loved him. We&#x27;ll try to do our best.
  We will be celebrating Will&#x27;s life on Saturday, November 23. A 
visitation will be held at Highlands Funeral Home, 3331 Taylorsville 
Road, 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, followed by a funeral service at St. Francis 
of Assisi at 6:30 pm. In lieu of flowers, please donate to one of the

 SUPPORTING H.R. 8371, ELIZABETH DOLE 21ST CENTURY VETERANS HEALTHCARE 
                      AND BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 19, 2024

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, every day, we lose an average of 17 
veterans to suicide. This statistic is not just a number; it represents 
real lives, families, and communities torn apart by tragedy. Behind 
each of these 17 daily losses is a story of service, sacrifice, and 
struggle. These are our neighbors, friends, and family members who have 
worn the uniform with pride and honor. They are mothers and fathers, 
sons and daughters, whose absence leaves an irreplaceable void in 
countless lives. The ripple effect of each suicide extends far beyond 
the individual, impacting spouses, children, parents, friends, and 
fellow veterans. It creates a cycle of grief and trauma that can 
persist for generations.
  As members of Congress, it is our responsibility to address this 
heartbreaking reality with the urgency and dedication it demands. 
Answering the call of duty to our veterans, I was proud to work with 
Senate Veterans Affair Committee Chairman Jon Tester to put forward 
H.R. 4157, Not Just a Number Act, legislation included in this Veterans 
omnibus package as Section 149 that would require the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to expand its scope when studying veteran suicide 
data. Instead of focusing solely on VA health care utilization, this 
bill mandates a more holistic approach, considering factors such as 
education, job training, housing, and other relevant socioeconomic 
factors. By broadening our perspective, we aim to gain a more 
comprehensive understanding of the complex, interconnected factors that 
contribute to veteran suicide. This approach will paint a more accurate 
picture of the multifaceted challenges our veterans face, enabling us 
to develop more effective support systems and interventions.
  While the Not Just a Number Act is a crucial step forward, we must 
recognize that addressing veteran suicide is an ongoing commitment. 
This bill lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding, 
but our work will not end with its passage. We must be prepared to 
adapt our strategies based on the insights gained and continuously 
improve our support systems. This is merely the beginning of a long-
term mission to safeguard the lives and well-being of our veterans.
  We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that can never truly be 
repaid. It is our responsibility to ensure that they feel our 
unwavering support and appreciation every single day. Let us honor our 
troops not just in words, but in our actions, by standing alongside 
them and their families. Together, let us ensure that they feel the 
depth of our appreciation and support at every step of their journey. I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical 
legislation. By passing the Not Just a Number Act as Section 149 of the 
Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits 
Improvement Act, we demonstrate our commitment to those who have served 
our nation and do everything in our power to prevent veteran suicide. 
If you or a veteran you know is in crisis, please call the Veterans 
Crisis Line at 988 and Press 1, or text 838255. Help is available 24/7, 
and you don&#x27;t have to be enrolled in VA benefits or health care to 
connect with caring, qualified responders.
