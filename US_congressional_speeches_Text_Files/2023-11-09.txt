   CELEBRATING ST. PHILIP BENIZI CATHOLIC CHURCH OF SMILEY, TX 60TH 
                              ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL CLOUD

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate St. Philip Benizi 
Catholic Church of Smiley, Texas, on its remarkable 60th anniversary 
this year. This incredible achievement stands as a powerful testament 
to the Congregation&#x27;s unwavering commitment to the faith and the Lord&#x27;s 
goodness to His people.
  The Church&#x27;s story is one of God&#x27;s timeliness, faithfulness, 
provision. It dates back to February 15, 1963, when Reverend Benton 
Thurmond wrote a letter to Archbishop Lucey requesting the need for the 
people to have a place to teach and freely practice their faith. It was 
decided that two Divine Providence Sister Catechists, working out of 
Gonzales, Texas, came to Smiley one full day a week to help Father 
Thurmond&#x27;s jurisdiction.
  At the time, the plans for the St. Philip&#x27;s Church were going through 
approval of construction plans and financing--and with any similar 
project comes financial challenges that often seem insurmountable. Yet, 
the Lord provided a donation through the Catholic Church Extension 
Society that summer, and by the Fall of 1963, all plans were approved 
for the new Church--beginning with a cornerstone donated by Robert 
Pessek of Hallettsville, Texas.
  In the years ahead, the Church became a rock in the community, 
serving as a place for neighbors to connect, gather, and worship. But 
more than anything, St. Philip&#x27;s milestone is a true testament to God&#x27;s 
grace toward his people. Today, Father Naveen Thumma continues St. 
Philip&#x27;s longstanding tradition of faith and spirit in the parish, 
leading the congregation into an incredible 60th year of service.
  Philippians 4:19 says ``And my God will supply every need of yours 
according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&#x27;&#x27; There is no better 
example St. Philip Benizi Catholic Church, sustained through God&#x27;s 
goodness.
  On November 10 and 11, the Church will observe its 60th birthday with 
a celebration, and I want to congratulate them and extend them well 
wishes on behalf of Texas-27. May God continue to bless them and 
provide for them in the coming years ahead.

  Mr. Speaker, congratulations to St. Philip&#x27;s Church on this memorable 
day. May God continue to bless the Church, their leaders, and the 
congregation in the present and future.

                          ____________________

 CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOTORCITIES NATIONAL HERITAGE 
                                  AREA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the MotorCities 
National Heritage Area (MCNHA) on the 25th anniversary of their 
founding. Their preservation and promotion of our area&#x27;s unique 
automotive and labor history is worthy of commendation.
  The MCNHA was inspired by the 100th anniversary of the automobile, an 
invention that shaped not only our state but the entire 20th century. 
In 1896, Henry Ford test drove his first automobile, the Quadricycle, 
through the streets of Detroit. Legislation co-sponsored by two 
Michigan Congressmen, John D. Dingell and Joe Knollenburg, was signed 
into law in 1998 by President Clinton. This law designated over 10,000 
square miles, 260 municipalities and townships. and 1,200 auto and 
labor related sites as the MotorCities National Heritage Area.
  The automotive and labor history of the region begins with Henry Ford 
and the Ford Motor Company, founded in 1903 in Dearborn, MI. Key 
investors in that company were brothers Horace and John Dodge, who 
would go on to found their own brand of vehicles in 1914. The moving 
assembly line that Ford introduced in 1913 at their Highland Park Plant 
would revolutionize not only industry, but labor as well. Daily wages 
were more than doubled to $5, shifts were reduced from 9 to 8 hours 
long, and the mass production of vehicles allowed automobiles to become 
much more accessible to the average American. Major international 
automotive brands, like GM (1908), Chevrolet (1911), and Chrysler 
(1925), were also founded in the Detroit region at that time. Decades 
later, car factories were converted to produce bombers in order to help 
in the Second World War. The factories of this area, like Willow Run in 
Ypsilanti, were so crucial to the effort that this region came to be 
known as the ``Arsenal of Democracy&#x27;&#x27;.
  Over the last 25 years, the MCNHA has built an appreciation in both 
residents and visitors for how the automobile changed Michigan, the 
nation, and the world. With the vast number of heritage sites across 
the region, the MCNHA started a grant program to focus on partnerships, 
connecting organizations and providing resources critical for 
preservation and promotion. It has directly provided over $1 million in 
grants to over 100 organizations to make these preservation, tourism, 
and educational projects a reality. The MCNHA has also been a boon for 
the State of Michigan, generating over $400 million in economic impact 
annually while supporting over 4,500 quality jobs.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
25th anniversary of the MCNHA. Our auto and labor industry helped 
establish and expand the United States as an industrial power and was a 
driving force for the creation of the middle class, and we thank the 
MCNHA for their great work in promoting and preserving our unique 
legacy. Just last year they were reauthorized for another 15 years, and 
we are excited to see how they will continue to tell our incredible 
story. Thank you to MCNHA.

                          ____________________

     CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LEGENDARY COACH BOB KNIGHT

                                 ______

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy 
of a legendary Hoosier, Coach Bob Knight, I would like to include

[[Page E1084]]

in the Record the obituary provided by Indiana University Athletics:

                   Coach Bob Knight Passes Away at 83


                      Indiana University Athletics

       Bloomington, Ind.--Bob Knight, one of the most successful 
     and influential figures in the history of college basketball, 
     passed away on Nov. 1, 2023 surrounded by family and friends. 
     He was 83 years old.
       Knight&#x27;s coaching accomplishments are legendary. He went 
     902-371 during a 42-year head coaching career that included 
     stops at Army (1966-71), Indiana (1972-2000), and Texas Tech 
     (2002-08). Those 902 wins ranked No. 1 all-time when he 
     retired in 2008, and currently ranks sixth. He was a four-
     time National Coach of the Year, a five-time Big Ten Coach of 
     the Year, and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall 
     of Fame (1991), the College Basketball Hall of Fame (2006), 
     and the IU Athletics Hall of Fame (2009).
       While he enjoyed tremendous success at each of his three 
     head coaching stops, he became a larger-than-life figure in 
     the sport thanks to his accomplishments in Bloomington. Hired 
     by IU at the age of 30 in 1971, he led the program to three 
     NCAA titles (1976, 1981, 1987), five Final Fours (1973, 1976, 
     1981, 1987, 1992), and 11 Big Ten Regular Season 
     Championships (1973-76, 1980-81, 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991, 
     1993) in his 29 years as head coach. Knight&#x27;s 1976 team, 
     which went 32-0 on its way to the NCAA title, remains the 
     most recent to go undefeated on its way to an NCAA title. His 
     1975 and 1976 teams, meanwhile, each went undefeated (18-0) 
     in Big Ten play, and no Big Ten team has gone undefeated in a 
     single season in league play since. Indiana&#x27;s 37 consecutive 
     Big Ten wins during that period also established a new 
     conference standard that has never been seriously threatened.
       Knight&#x27;s dominance at IU stretched through all three 
     decades that he coached in Bloomington. The 1970s included 
     four Big Ten titles, two Final Fours, and one of the greatest 
     teams in college basketball history with the undefeated 1976 
     national champions. As great as the 1970s were, the 1980s 
     were even better. College basketball&#x27;s most successful team 
     during the decade, Knight&#x27;s teams captured two NCAA titles 
     and five Big Ten championships. In the 1990s, the Hoosiers 
     won two more league crowns, advanced to another Final Four, 
     earned 10 NCAA tourney bids, and four straight Sweet 16 
     trips. The 1990s also featured one of Knight&#x27;s greatest teams 
     to not win an NCAA title, as the 1993 team went 17-1 in the 
     Big Ten, was the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, 
     and featured four players that would eventually be first-
     round NBA Draft picks.
       In addition to his accomplishments representing Indiana 
     University, Knight also enjoyed similar success on the 
     international level. He assembled and coached arguably the 
     greatest amateur men&#x27;s basketball team in history, as he led 
     the 1984 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal in Los Angeles, 
     and guided the U.S. team to the 1979 Pan American Games gold 
     as well.
       While his teams excelled on the court, Knight&#x27;s student-
     athletes also embodied what it meant to be a student-athlete. 
     During his IU coaching career, 98 percent of his four-year 
     players earned their degrees.
       Besides being one of the sport&#x27;s most successful coaches, 
     Knight was also one of the most innovative. He revolutionized 
     and popularized the `motion offense,&#x27; an offensive style 
     originally credited to one of Knight&#x27;s mentors, Henry Iba. 
     Unlike traditional `set&#x27; offensive plays, the motion offense 
     relied on player movement, proper spacing, passing, cutting, 
     and screening to create scoring opportunities, It&#x27;s a style 
     of play that became synonymous with Knight and his IU teams, 
     and it remains very much a staple of many of the game&#x27;s most 
     successful coaches to this day. Defensively, Knight was 
     equally committed to a single style, as he had a deeply-
     rooted belief in the merits of the man-to-man defense.
       The successes of both styles were enormous throughout his 
     IU tenure, as his Hoosier teams were traditionally one of the 
     Big Ten&#x27;s most efficient offensively and one of the most 
     difficult to score against defensively. As a result, Indiana 
     won 73.5 percent of its games during Knight&#x27;s tenure, the 
     best among all Big Ten programs during that period. IU also 
     earned 24 invitations to the NCAA Tournament during his 29 
     years, going 42-21 (.667) in those games. Overall, 28 of 
     Knight&#x27;s 29 IU teams earned postseason invitations.
       While Knight&#x27;s system and his unwavering belief in those 
     coaching philosophies were a big part of his success at IU, 
     an even more important component of his success was the 
     abundance of exceptional student-athletes that he attracted 
     to and developed in Bloomington.
       In all, Knight coached nine Big Ten MVPs and 27 All-
     Americans at IU. His first Big Ten MVP was Steve Downing, who 
     earned the honor in 1973 after leading Knight&#x27;s second 
     Hoosier team to the program&#x27;s first Big Ten title in six 
     years and its first Final Four trip in 20 seasons. The next 
     to win the award was Scott May, the Big Ten&#x27;s MVP in both 
     1975 and 1976 who also became Knight&#x27;s first National Player 
     of the Year in 1976. Calbert Cheaney became Knight&#x27;s second 
     National Player of the Year in 1993 after guiding IU to a Big 
     Ten title, an Elite Eight berth, and becoming the Big Ten&#x27;s 
     all-time leading scorer with 2,613 points, a mark that stands 
     to this day.
       The list of Knight&#x27;s legendary IU players doesn&#x27;t end 
     there. Far from it. Quinn Buckner was a two-time All-
     American, a three-time Big Ten champion, an Olympic gold 
     medalist, and a future NBA champion whom Knight often 
     referenced as the greatest leader in program history. Isiah 
     Thomas was a 1981 All-American who guided IU to the NCAA 
     title that same season before going on to a Hall of Fame and 
     championship professional career with the NBA&#x27;s Detroit 
     Pistons. Steve Alford was a Big Ten MVP and two-time All-
     American who led the 1987 team to an NCAA title. And current 
     IU coach Mike Woodson was a two-time All-American and 1980 
     Big Ten MVP who was Knight&#x27;s first IU player to score 2,000 
     career points.
       Knight was born on Oct. 25, 1940, in Orrville, Ohio. A 
     multi-sport standout at Orrville H.S., Knight played 
     basketball at Ohio State for Hall of Fame Coach Fred Taylor 
     from 1958-62. A key reserve on those Buckeye teams, Knight 
     played alongside future Hall of Famers John Havlicek and 
     Jerry Lucas and helped OSU to the 1960 NCAA title and NCAA 
     runner-up finishes in both 1961 and 1962.
       After graduating from Ohio State in 1962, Knight spent one 
     year coaching high school basketball at Cuyahoga Falls (Ohio) 
     H.S. before enlisting in the Army in 1963. While in the Army, 
     Knight accepted an assistant coaching position with the men&#x27;s 
     basketball team, and two years later was promoted to head 
     coach at the age of 24. He went 102-50 in six years with the 
     program and earned four NIT invitations before IU Athletic 
     Director Bill Orwig announced his hiring as IU&#x27;s new head 
     coach on March 27, 1971.

  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Barry R. Feirstein 
and the memory of Holly Peyton Good Feirstein, who both worked to

 HONORING PASTOR ROGER SPRADLIN, FOUNDER OF THE VALLEY BAPTIST CHURCH, 
                              BAKERSFIELD

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
remarkable life of Pastor Roger Spradlin.
  Born in Oklahoma in 1955, Pastor Spradlin graduated from Oklahoma 
Baptist University in Shawnee in 1977. He then enrolled in Criswell 
College in Dallas, Texas, where he began to formulate his vision to 
open a grand church in California.
  Pastor Spradlin arrived in Bakersfield, California, in the late 
1970s, serving as both a pastor and the Baptist Student Union Director 
at California State University, Bakersfield, During this time, he began 
demonstrating to our community that he was a man of resilient faith and 
steadfast compassion. Pastor Spradlin boldly embarked with other local 
pastors on a mission to create a Bakersfield-area Baptist campus.
  Valley Baptist Church was born and grew in size over the next decade 
to a 2,000-seat auditorium by the late 1990s Under Pastor Spradlin&#x27;s 
leadership and vision, Valley Baptist would incorporate three 
additional campuses in the Bakersfield area. where services are now 
conducted in four different languages to meet the needs of our 
community.
  In addition to his work in Bakersfield, Pastor Spradlin proved 
himself a renowned leader in the California Southern Baptist 
Convention. Exemplifying the highest standards of moral and spiritual 
leadership, Pastor Spradlin served as chairman of the trustees of the 
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, as well as chairman of the 
Executive Committee of the Southern Baptist Convention.
  While Pastor Spradlin held an impressive list of accomplishments in 
Southern Baptist Convention leadership, he is remembered most fondly 
for his lasting, positive impact on countless lives. His sermons 
underpinned his passion and commitment to the salvation of all those 
with whom he spoke, balancing truth with the tenderness of grace.
  Pastor Spradlin lived a remarkable life as a true pillar of 
Bakersfield. He cared for those in need with humility and grace, and 
made a difference in countless lives, including mine. He helped spread 
the message of God&#x27;s love not only throughout our community, but around 
the world. While Pastor Spradlin will be greatly missed, I am certain 
that his legacy will live on through Valley Baptist Church and the 
Valley Baptist church family who I know will continue to strive to 
sustain the vision he brought to our community.
  Judy and I offer our sincere condolences to Pastor Spradlin&#x27;s 
family--his wife of 46 years. Ginger, their 3 children, Andrew, 
Matthew, and Faith, and 10 grandchildren. We will always cherish his 
friendship, remember the wisdom he imparted on us and our community, 
and keep his family and all those who attend Valley Baptist in our 
prayers.
  On behalf of the 20th Congressional District of California, I would 
like to honor the life and legacy of Pastor Roger Spradlin for his 
dedication to Christ, leading a great congregation, and for being a 
beacon of compassion and love that the whole Bakersfield community will 
miss.

   HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF FORT WAYNE POLICE OFFICER DAVID 
                                TINSLEY

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM BANKS

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of 
Fort Wayne Police Officer David Tinsley, who five years ago died in the 
line of duty, and to commemorate the designation of the Officer David 
Tinsley Memorial Parkway in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
  Officer Tinsley was known to his colleagues as a committed, 
professional police officer devoted to the force and to his craft. 
Across his sixteen years in the Fort Wayne Police Department, he led by 
example, developing a reputation as a faithful servant to his 
community, his fellow officers, and his family and loved ones.
  The Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway will honor its namesake, 
encompassing a stretch of Fort Wayne&#x27;s roadway that Officer Tinsley 
would frequently patrol. It also passes by his home church of Emmanuel 
Lutheran and serves as a gateway for visitors entering downtown Fort 
Wayne from the west. I cannot imagine a more fitting tribute.
  Each time they travel along the parkway, residents of northeast 
Indiana will celebrate Officer Tinsley&#x27;s service and recognize what an 
indispensable role he played in his community. We will never forget his 
memory, and the Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway will stand as an 
enduring testament to his valor and service.

                          ____________________

  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Lula 
``Mae&#x27;&#x27; Parker-Harris, a pillar of the Dutchess County community who 
was beloved by all who knew her. Mae recently passed away on August 27, 
2023, at the age of 79.
  Mae attended public schools and was educated at Dutchess Community 
College. She spent her career at various organizations including 
Dutchess Community Day Care Center, Wassaic Developmental Center, and 
Astor Head Start.
  Mae was known throughout the community for her selflessness and 
integrity. A devoted member of the Smith Metropolitan AME Zion Church, 
she was committed to civil activism, social responsibility, and equity 
and equality in and around her community. Her contributions to 
Poughkeepsie, NY and Dutchess County will endure for generations to 
come, and she will be dearly missed by all who knew her.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in 
recognizing the life of Lula Mae Parker-Harris, a remarkable woman who 
made a lasting difference in her community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SERVICE ACADEMIES DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EQUALITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Service Academies 
District of Columbia Equality Act, which would give the District of 
Columbia the same number of appointments and nominations to the U.S. 
service academies as states. Currently, each Member of the House and 
each senator is allocated five appointments to each service academy--
the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air 
Force Academy--and each Member of the House and each senator is allowed 
10 nominations for each appointment. Therefore, since D.C. has no 
senators, D.C. is deprived of 10 appointments and, assuming all 
appointments are vacant, 10 nominations to each service academy. I am 
pleased Senator Tim Kaine has introduced the companion bill.
  This bill would provide equality for D.C. residents who choose to 
serve their country by applying to a service academy. It is remarkable 
that D.C. residents volunteer to serve a country that denies them 
statehood, congressional voting rights and full home rule. D.C. 
residents have fought in every American war, and D.C. residents, who 
pay all federal taxes, including paying more federal taxes per capita 
than the residents of any state, deserve the same opportunity to attend 
our prestigious service academies as residents of states.
  D.C.&#x27;s population (690,000) is larger than that of two states and is 
in line with the six states that have a population under one million. 
D.C. servicemembers have helped secure voting rights for people around 
the world, yet have always been denied those same rights when they 
returned home. D.C. residents deserve equality at the service 
academies.
  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Orange High 
School&#x27;s Marine Corps Junior ROTC Program and its cadets.
  In 1955, Master Gunnery Sergeant James H. Fearns petitioned to 
establish the first ever Marine Corps JROTC Program in any Orange 
County High School. His request was repeatedly denied, but the Master 
Gunnery Sergeant remained committed and traveled to Washington, D.C. to 
demand a meeting with the

[[Page E1083]]

Commandant of the Marine Corps. After speaking with the General a few 
days later, Master Gunnery Sergeant Fearns returned to Orange County 
having secured the charter.
  Today, Orange High School has one of the largest Marine Corps JROTC 
Program in the Western United States. The JROTC Program instills in its 
162 cadets the values of citizenship, service to others, self-
discipline, and personal responsibility.
  Personal success after high school is an integral part of this 
program, exemplified by the James H. Fearns Marine Corps JROTC Memorial 
Scholarship. This scholarship awards cadets who wish to attend college 
or pursue a vocational school certification. Last year, 12 cadets 
received this prestigious award.
  As we prepare to celebrate the 248th birthday of the U.S. Marine 
Corps, I am proud to recognize Orange High School&#x27;s JROTC program and 
its cadets. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring these 
accomplished students as they grow to become the leaders of tomorrow.

      TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Thursday, November 9, 2023

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to all the men 
and women who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States and 
risked their lives to defend our freedoms and way of life and took and 
lived the oath to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.&#x27;&#x27;
  Our Veterans have borne ``true faith and allegiance to the same, an 
obligation they took freely, without any mental reservation or purpose 
of evasion.&#x27;&#x27;
  Veterans are truly heroes walking among us.
  I want to thank all of our armed servicemen and women for their 
selfless dedication to our protection every day.
  Veterans Day is a reminder to all of us who live in freedom that as 
President Kennedy said, ``The price of freedom is high, but Americans 
have always paid it.&#x27;&#x27;
  This Veterans Day is a welcome opportunity to remember the fallen who 
gave the last full measure of devotion to their country on battlefields 
around the world--in places whose names may be unforgettable--or 
locations that have slipped into the pages of history.
  We will never forget:

       Revolutionary War--Valley Forge; York Town;
       Civil War--The Battle of Antietam; The Battle of 
     Gettysburg;
       World War I--The Battle of Argonne; Flanders Field; Verdun;
       World War II--Pearl Harbor; Battle of Bataan; The Battle of 
     Midway; D-Day; Battle of the Bulge; Battle of Anzio; Battle 
     of Corregidor;
       Korean War--Inchon; Heart Break Ridge; Pork Chop Hill;
       Vietnam--Tet Offensive; Battle of Hue;
       Desert Storm--September 11, 2001; Pentagon Attack (125 
     killed);
       Operation Enduring Freedom; Battle of Kandahar;
       Operation Iraqi Freedom; Second Battle of Fallujah; 
     Operation Allies Refuge; Operation Allies Welcome.

  The memory of the fallen is never forgotten.
  Mr. Speaker, each Veterans Day, Americans come together to remember 
those who have served our country around the world in the name of 
freedom and democracy.
  The debt that we owe to them is immeasurable.
  Their sacrifices, and those of their families, are freedom&#x27;s 
foundation.
  Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, 
marines and Coast Guardsmen and women and their families, our country 
would not live so freely.
  I offer my deepest gratitude to our nation&#x27;s 1.4 million troops and 
reservists, their families, and the 16.2 million veterans, including 
22,809 here in the 18th Congressional District.
  16.2 million brave men and women are veterans of our nation&#x27;s 
military service.
  This includes more than 1.7 million women, 2.7 million African 
American men and women, 1.32 million Hispanic men and women, 342,000 
Asian American Pacific Islanders, and 113,000 American Indians.
  Of the veteran population in the country, 1.5 million veterans call 
Texas their home.
  We use Veterans Day to show our veterans and military families how 
important they are to us and how grateful we are for them each day.
  November is National Caregivers Month to show our caregivers how 
grateful we are for them.
  It is only fitting that we thank those caregivers who serve our 
military today.
  5.5 million spouses, parents, children, and other loved ones care for 
our wounded warriors and 15 percent of caregivers spend 40+ hours a 
week providing care for our military families.
  As a senior member of the House Committees on Judiciary and Homeland 
Security, I care deeply about our veterans.
  In Congress, I have sponsored many legislative proposals and co-
sponsored more than 50 pieces of legislation that will positively 
benefit our veterans and their families.
  Including H.R. 232, the Real Justice for Our Veterans Act of 2023, 
which looks to prioritize veterans court treatment programs, ensuring 
equal access for women, as well as racial and ethnic minorities who 
have served.
  Additionally, I introduced H.R. 236, which would create a ``Battle 
Buddy Check Week,&#x27;&#x27; meant to provide outreach and education, as well as 
peer wellness checks for Veterans.
  On the battlefield, the military pledges to leave no soldiers behind.
  As a Nation, let it be our pledge that when they return home, we will 
leave no veteran behind.
  This day and every day, let us honor their service with actions that 
fulfill our commitment to our troops, their families, and our 
veterans--and that are worthy of our grateful Nation.
