  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, in April, I had the pleasure 
of attending the 25th anniversary celebration of Big Sky Aviation in 
Millville, South Jersey. As a full-service, fixed-base operator, this 
aviation center provides a valuable and enriching experience to our 
South Jersey residents through its many services. These services 
include hangar leasing, aircraft cleaning, jet fueling, pre-purchased 
inspections, airframe repairs, tie downs, car services, catering, and 
much more. They also offer personalized flight school programs working 
directly with students to create a strategy that aligns with their 
individual needs and objectives. The experienced team of aviation 
professionals at Big Sky Aviation ensure that your visit to South 
Jersey is as convenient and enjoyable as possible. I thank all the 
staff at Big Sky Aviation for sharing their passion for aviation with 
our South Jersey community for the past 25 years. God Bless Big Sky 
Aviation, and God Bless our United States of America.

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to recognize and 
congratulate BCI Solutions, Inc. in Bremen, Indiana on being inducted 
into the Indiana Manufacturers Hall of Fame this month.
  I often say that Hoosier manufacturing is second to none, and I am 
proud to represent the Manufacturing Capital of the World here in 
Indiana&#x27;s Second District. The professional, high-quality work that BCI 
has done for more than 80 years has played a meaningful role in 
allowing our District to have and maintain that distinction.
  Founded in 1939 as Bremen Gray Iron Foundry, BCI has grown into a 
renowned name and a leading provider of castings, machining, and 
complex assemblies. Because of their continuous commitment to improving 
and investing in advancing technologies, BCI is on the forefront of 
providing products to the defense, agricultural, healthcare, lawn and 
garden and automotive industries, among others.
  Additionally, BCI&#x27;s example as a successful family-owned business now 
operating in their fifth generation is an inspiration to those looking 
to start their own companies, as well as a source of pride for many 
Hoosiers.
  Congratulations again to BCI Solutions, Inc. on being recognized for 
this impressive distinction. I join Hoosiers in thanking them for their 
many contributions to Marshall County and communities throughout the 
Second District. I wish them continued success and many more years in 
business and accolades to celebrate going forward.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I honor the 100th 
birthday of Dorothy Helen Dougherty, a woman of great character and 
dedication. Dorothy was born on October 7, 1923, and grew up in a 
loving, multi-generational household in Pennsylvania. After attending 
secretarial school in Philadelphia and working as a secretary for 
several years, she married her husband in January 1948. Together, they 
settled in Ocean City, South Jersey and built a successful residential 
construction and real estate business while raising three sons. Dorothy 
remained active in her church and community, and she volunteered in 
various charitable efforts, including helping the less fortunate 
through food and clothing donations. Tragically, she lost her husband 
at 58 but found solace in Lake Worth, Florida, where she became an 
active member of her church and excelled as a shuffleboard champion. 
Most importantly, Dorothy&#x27;s legacy continues through her loving family, 
including three sons, eight grandchildren, and thirteen great-
grandchildren who affectionately know her as ``GiGi.&#x27;&#x27; So, on Dorothy&#x27;s 
100th birthday, we honor her remarkable life and her enduring impact on 
her family and community. God Bless Dorothy Dougherty and God Bless the 
United States of America.

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I want to commend the 
achievements of Eustace Mita, a prominent figure in South Jersey&#x27;s 
luxury real estate industry. Mr. Mita serves as Chairman and CEO of 
Icona Resorts, Chairman of Mita Management, and CEO of Achristavest, 
all of which have left a significant mark on South Jersey&#x27;s luxury real 
estate sector. He founded ICONA Resorts in 2013, quickly establishing a 
highly regarded brand of luxury hotels in South Jersey, including the 
top ranked Icona Diamond Beach resort. Currently, ICONA operates seven 
hotels along the South Jersey shore in Avalon, Cape May, Wildwood 
Crest, and Spring Lake. Mr. Mita&#x27;s business ventures extend to high-end 
luxury home development with Achristavest and strategic investments in 
local real estate and the automotive sectors through Mita Management. 
Outside of business, he is a devoted family man to his wife, Susie, and 
their five children and sixteen grandchildren. He is a respected leader 
in the Catholic Church&#x27;s service initiatives and his contributions were 
recognized by Pope Francis during the 2015 World Meeting of Families in 
Philadelphia. He also serves as the first lay president of the Papal 
Foundation, a charity that funds Papal requests for charitable grants 
and scholarships. It is an honor to celebrate Eustace Mita&#x27;s 
contributions to South Jersey&#x27;s luxury real estate and commitment to 
community service. His entrepreneurial spirit and dedication have left 
a lasting impact on our South Jersey community. God Bless Eustice Mita 
and God Bless the United States of America.

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I rise in celebration of 
the grand reopening of Kountry Kitchen Soul Food Place, a beloved 
Indianapolis establishment specializing in southern-style soul food.
  Located in Indiana&#x27;s 7th Congressional District, Kountry Kitchen was 
established in 1988 by Ms. Jessie White to bring her southern-style 
home cooking to the neighborhood, under the name Jessie&#x27;s Place. Ms. 
Jessie&#x27;s daughter, Nell Wilson, later joined to grow the family 
business and introduce her own recipes. Nell and her husband, Isaac, 
renamed the diner to Country Kitchen. After Nell&#x27;s passing, Isaac 
remarried, and with his wife Cynthia, they renamed the business Kountry 
Kitchen. Isaac and Cynthia continue to honor this legacy by serving the 
recipes passed down to them by Ms. Jessie and Nell.
  A nationally recognized restaurant, Kountry Kitchen has caught the 
attention of many notable figures, including Jimmy Fallon, former 
President Barack Obama, and Indianapolis native Mike Epps.
  In early 2020, Kountry Kitchen suffered a devasting fire. Thankfully, 
there was no loss of life, but the establishment suffered extensive 
damage. With the help of a $400,000 grant, assistance from local 
organizations, and the entire Indianapolis community coming together, 
Kountry Kitchen broke ground on its new location in the summer of 2022. 
One year later, we are proudly celebrating their grand reopening.
  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our 
congratulations and thanks to a beloved community staple and 
recognizing the enduring legacy of this iconic Indianapolis 
destination.

 HONORING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 349TH AIR MOBILITY WING (RESERVE)

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize the 349th 
Air Mobility Wing (Reserve), assigned to the Air Mobility Command, 
Scott Air Force Base, II. The 349th, celebrated its 80th anniversary on 
October 14, 2023.
  The 349th AMW (Reserve). located at Travis Air Force Base, 
California, is the largest associate wing in the United States Air 
Force Reserve. 349th AMW personnel fly the C-5 Galaxy, the C-17 
Globemaster III, and the KC-10 Extender, and are now transitioning to 
the KC-46 Pegasus. The missions of the wing&#x27;s aircrews include 
airlifting personnel and material worldwide as well as aerial refueling 
a wide variety of aircraft.
  The 349th AMW is also home to the 349th Aeromedical Evacuation 
Squadron, responsible for treating patients during medical airlift; the 
349th Airlift Control Flight, tasked to enter austere locations and 
prepare for USAF aircraft arrival; and the 349th Medical Squadron, 
capable of providing hospital services worldwide, in a contingency 
environment.
  The mission of the 349th AMW is to ``generate and sustain combat-
ready mobility Airmen.&#x27;&#x27; This makes the wing responsible for training 
almost 3,500 Reservists who, in turn, work side-by-side their active-
duty counterparts in the 60th AMW, also stationed at Travis.
  In November 1943, 349th Troop Carrier Group was activated at Sedalia 
Army Air Field, Missouri. The 349th TCG had five troop carrier 
squadrons assigned, including what is now the 312th Airlift Squadron, 
which is still assigned to the 349th.
  The 349th, like the other reserve troop carrier wings, was completely 
equipped and ready to move with only a few hours&#x27; notice as was the 
case during the Cuban call-up. Only four hours after the first call to 
report for duty was made, 95 percent of the wing&#x27;s flying personnel had 
checked in and were ready to move. This proved the value of the Air 
Force Reserve&#x27;s ``Ready Now&#x27;&#x27; concept and the wing&#x27;s motto ``In Omnia 
Paratus.&#x27;&#x27; In all things prepared.
  A recall to active duty was again initiated on January 26, 1968, for 
the Vietnam War, and many hundreds of tons of cargo were carried across 
the Pacific. Upon deactivation in 1969, the 349th moved to Travis AFB, 
CA.
  In 1972, the 349th joined the active component in flying and 
maintaining the C-5 ``Galaxy&#x27;&#x27; making the 349th a two-weapon system 
reserve strategic airlift wing.
  On February 1, 1992, the 349th was re-designated the 349th Airlift 
Wing, deleting the word ``military&#x27;&#x27; from its name to conform with the 
active-duty Air Force&#x27;s reorganization and realignment policies.
  In September 1994, the KC-10 ``Extender&#x27;&#x27; tanker mission was added to 
the Wing and became an ``Air Mobility Wing,&#x27;&#x27; the only Air Force 
Reserve unit at the time to fly three types of aircraft: the C-141 
``Starlifter,&#x27;&#x27; the C-5 ``Galaxy,&#x27;&#x27; and the KC-10.
  With the C-17 ``Globemaster III&#x27;&#x27; arrival at Travis in Summer 2006, 
the wing and its host became the only units in the country to fly three 
major weapons systems. On May 25, 2006, the 301st Airlift Squadron 
converted from the C-5 to the C-17 and on June 25, 2006, the 945th 
Aircraft Maintenance Squadron was activated to support the Globemaster 
III.
  Most recently the 349th Aeromedicine Squadron deployed reserve 
medical personnel in support of New York City&#x27;s response to the

[[Page E986]]

Covid-19 pandemic, and 61 Wing Airmen deployed in support of Operation 
Allies Refuge.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore and colleagues, please join me in praising 
the dedicated service of the Air Force reservist assigned to the 349th 
Air Mobility Wing (Reserve), Travis AFB, CA, who give and have given of 
their time and talents to serve our Nation and support our military 
readiness. I thank them for their commitment and sacrifice to help keep 
our U.S. Air Force strong and prepared for action when called upon.

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. TED LIEU

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize the life and 
service of Ukrainian Air Force Major Andrii Pilshchykov, a fighter 
pilot who tragically lost his life in the fight to defend his country 
from the Russian invasion. Mr. Pilshchykov reached the rank of Captain 
in the 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade of the Ukrainian Air Force, 
before being posthumously promoted to Major.
  Born in Kharkiv only 30 years ago, Andrii fulfilled his life-long 
dream to fly some of the fastest and toughest airplanes in the world. 
From a young age, Andrii was fascinated with airplanes and jets and 
eagerly took on the little-known hobby of ``Planespotting,&#x27;&#x27; in which 
participants track the movement and record photos of desired aircraft 
all around the globe. As soon as he could, Andrii enrolled in Ukraine&#x27;s 
Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University. It was in this academy 
that Andrii learned to fly MiG-29 fighter jets, which he would go on to 
fly during the current war to save his country. Andrii&#x27;s peers and 
instructors were so impressed with his abilities that he was assigned 
to be an instructor for certain classes even though he was still a 
cadet.
  After graduating from the academy in 2018, Andrii joined the 40th 
Tactical Aviation Brigade at Yasylkiv Air Base, where he would become 
an Air Force Captain. During his first year, Andrii traveled to my home 
state of California, where he completed an internship with the 144th 
Fighter Wing of California&#x27;s Air National Guard in the City of Fresno. 
As he learned how to fly F-15 fighter jets, Andrii took his learning 
experience in California very seriously, earning the nickname ``Juice&#x27;&#x27; 
because he would only order juice as he refrained from alcohol. He took 
this nickname back home with him, and for a time he was the only pilot 
in the Ukrainian Armed Forces with an official call sign: ``Juice.&#x27;&#x27;
  After leaving the Air Force for only a brief period, Andrii did not 
hesitate to sign up again for service in February 2022 as the Russian 
invasion threatened the people and very sovereignty of Ukraine. It was 
not long before he resumed flights, fighting to keep Ukrainian skies 
safe over Kyiv and other major battle areas. During Andrii&#x27;s service, 
he flew over 100 combat missions and destroyed dozens of the enemy&#x27;s 
command posts. In May 2022, Andrii was awarded the Order for Courage 
(3rd Class) for his valiant service.
  Because of his keen interest in promoting the modernization of 
Ukraine&#x27;s Air Force, and his proficiency in English, Andrii and a small 
contingent of his colleagues were sent to Washington, D.C., to 
illustrate and emphasize the urgent need to supply Ukraine with F-16 
fighter jets. I had the honor of meeting Andrii. After his visit to 
Capitol Hill, the Ukraine Fighter Pilots Act was introduced, which I 
was proud to cosponsor.
  I want to express my deepest appreciation for the invaluable service 
rendered not only to the nation of Ukraine, but in the fight for 
democracy itself, by Major Andrii Pilshchykov. My deepest condolences 
go out to his family, the people of Ukraine and all those impacted by 
his loss.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NO FENCING AT THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL COMPLEX ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I introduce the No 
Fencing at the United States Capitol Complex Act, which would prohibit 
the installation of new permanent fencing on the grounds of the United 
States Capitol complex. I am pleased that Senator Chris Van Hollen is 
introducing this bill in the Senate.
  After the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, 
the Capitol complex became an untraversable fortress surrounded by 
frightening fences capped with barbed wire--typical of authoritarian 
regimes. Although more needs to be done to protect the Capitol complex, 
the failure of Capitol security leaders to plan for the predictable and 
openly announced attack on the Capitol on January 6th does not justify 
closing the complex to the public, to whom it belongs. We can and must 
maintain our commitment to security without sacrificing public access 
by using the least restrictive means necessary to address security.
  The January 6th attack on the Capitol, which had little to do with 
the lack of permanent fencing, was the greatest intelligence and 
security failure in the history of our nation&#x27;s capital. There were 
countless security failures on January 6th that we can and must 
address, including: taking threats of extremist violence seriously at 
an earlier stage; closing the Capitol building grounds during high-
profile and high-threat events, as is typically done, but was not done 
on January 6th; manpower; building security; and training. Permanent 
fencing, which is incredibly imprecise, would not address those 
security lapses. It is more likely to keep out children, joggers and 
tourists than a coordinated attack on the Capitol. In fact, it is a 
form of security theater--it would make the Capitol ``look&#x27;&#x27; safer but 
mask the lack of state-of-the-art security measures that could prevent 
attacks in the future. Every threat to the Capitol since January 6th 
has been stopped by longstanding and new security measures and the 
excellent work of the Capitol Police. Permanent fencing would not aid 
the Capitol Police in stopping threats but it would create an image of 
authoritarianism, secrecy and inaccessibility. The Capitol complex is 
for all the American people, and, with proper security, must remain 
open to them.
  Permanent fencing would send an un-American message to the nation and 
the world, by transforming our democracy from one that is accessible, 
transparent and of the people to one that is closed off, secretive and 
fearful of its own citizens. It would tell the world that the most 
powerful nation must rely on crude barriers for safety instead of 
state-of-the-art intelligence and security protocols. The Capitol has 
welcomed First Amendment protests and demonstrations for centuries 
without becoming a fortress, The openness of the Capitol and our 
democracy is our strength, not a security weakness that needs to be 
rooted out. Any further consideration of permanent fencing is 
desperate, distasteful and disrespectful of our history and 
institutions.
  Furthermore, the Capitol complex does not exist in a vacuum. It is 
immediately surrounded by residential neighborhoods and local 
businesses, which form the heart of the District of Columbia. Permanent 
fencing would cause serious damage to the fabric of these communities. 
After January 6th, these residents and businesses were more than 
understanding as their neighborhoods turned into militarized zones. 
They waited patiently as officers checked their identification on their 
walks home or took alternative routes when they found blocked streets. 
Permanent fencing would infringe on their ability, as well as the 
general public&#x27;s ability, to enjoy the public spaces that define our 
nation&#x27;s capital.
  The distance between government and the people has grown, with trust 
in government at historic lows. Installing permanent fencing at the 
Capitol complex would only increase that distance.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER OF CAPE COD

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in honor of 
Community Health Center of Cape Cod&#x27;s 25th anniversary.
  Community Health Center (CHC) of Cape Cod was first established in 
1998 by a group or volunteer doctors and nurses committed to providing 
free healthcare services to uninsured residents of the Cape and 
Islands. CHC originally started as the Falmouth Free Clinic in the 
basement of Falmouth Hospital and

[[Page E985]]

served 600 patients in its first year. Today, CHC serves over 25,000 
patients and has locations in five towns across the Upper Cape. It was 
also recently announced that CHC received a five-million-dollar grant 
through the American Rescue Plan to open a new location to serve more 
patients on Cape Cod. The new facility will be LEED silver certified 
and include affordable housing to support the community and workforce.
  Since 2003, CHC has been led by CEO, Karen Gardner. Under Ms. 
Gardner&#x27;s leadership, CHC continues to grow and evolve to better serve 
its patients. Over the last two decades, CHC has built a 33,000 square 
foot facility in Mashpee; added oral health, women&#x27;s health, 340B 
pharmacy, and vision services; implemented an electronic medical record 
system; and was designated a federally qualified health center in 2006.
  Whether it be transportation or insurance costs, Community Health 
Center of Cape Cod continuously works to break down barriers to 
accessing quality healthcare. By combining the different skills and 
backgrounds of its board members and staff, CHC always strives to 
provide the best healthcare to the community that it serves, especially 
those from vulnerable populations. Over the last 25 years, CHC has 
operated with the goal of providing high-quality, comprehensive, and 
affordable care regardless of a person&#x27;s ability to pay and has 
established itself as a pillar of the Cape Cod community.
  Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to honor Community Health Center 
of Cape Cod, and I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating its 
25th anniversary and wishing CHC continued success in the years to 
come.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I would like to recognize Dawn 
Futch, her husband Mike Futch, and their daughter Stephanie Futch for 
their charitable service towards the people of Brevard County. After 
the sudden and tragic passing of Dawn and Mike&#x27;s son Michael-Gene, the 
Futch family created the Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation.
  When Michael-Gene Futch passed away in November of 2010, his family 
requested basketballs instead of flowers due to Michael-Gene&#x27;s love of 
the sport. When over 1,500 basketballs came, the Futch family decided 
to donate those basketballs to underprivileged children in Brevard 
County.
  This charitable donation led to the creation of the Michael-Gene Kids 
Basketball Foundation, which aims to help underprivileged families. 
Since the Foundation was formed, it has grown far past donations of 
basketballs. While continuing basketball donations year-round, the 
Futch Foundation also hosts a back-to-school drive, sponsor-a-family 
thanksgiving, and a gift drive for the holiday season.
  The Futch Family also holds an annual black-tie affair to raise money 
for charity. The Futch family plans to continue their many years of 
charity work for the children of Brevard County.
  I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to 
join me in recognizing the Futch family and saluting their selfless 
service. The Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation is an inspiration 
and blessing to underprivileged children, and families in our 
community.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor and 
remember the life of United States Army veteran Richard Edward 
Santspree.
  Richard was born in Troy, New York on July 28, 1950. After graduating 
from Cohoes High School, Richard enlisted with the United States Army 
in October 1967. He served in the Army for three years, rising to the 
rank of Specialist Fourth Class, before he was honorably discharged in 
October 1970. For his service, Richard was awarded the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and M16 Expert and 
M14 Sharpshooter badges. Richard remained with the Army Reserves until 
1973.
  Returning to civilian life, Richard married the love of his life 
Christine Hogan Santspree in April 1971. They moved to Cohoes and 
started their family together, raising three children; Kimberly, 
Richard Jr., and Thomas. Richard spent his professional career with 
General Electric in Schenectady, working as a machinist for four 
decades before retiring in August 2010.
  Richard was a well-rounded member of the Cohoes and Troy communities, 
participating in his local church, veterans&#x27; organizations, and 
recreational activities. He was a member of the Cohoes Moose Club, the 
Cohoes-Waterford Elk&#x27;s Lodge 1317, and the American Legion Ruane Post 
476. Richard competed in a league at the Cohoes Bowling Arena, along 
with the Cohoes Rod and Gun Club&#x27;s Dart and Horseshoe League. Richard 
assisted with St. Rita&#x27;s Church&#x27;s annual bazaar, as well as the Rod and 
Gun Club&#x27;s kids&#x27; fishing contest at the Van Schaick Island pond. More 
than anything, he was a proud family man who enjoyed travelling and 
spending time with his wife, children, and three grandchildren.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I am honored to 
recognize the life of Mr. Richard E. Santspree, defined by exemplary 
service to his community and his country.

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I want to honor the 
accomplishments of Aiden Inman, Ethan Scattone, and William Will, 
students at Oakcrest High School who competed in the SIFMA Foundation 
Capitol Hill Challenge and placed tenth in the Nation. They 
participated as a part of their Stock Market and Investments class 
under the guidance of their teacher, Joe Cirigliano and their 
supervisor Nicole Gazia. This exemplary group of students participated 
in a 14-week competition where they managed a hypothetical $100,000 
online portfolio of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ESG investments, and 
cash. Out of a student participation of over 6,500 students, Oakcrest 
placed in the top ten performing teams in the nation. I am incredibly 
proud of these students and all of their accomplishments, and I can&#x27;t 
wait to see the big things they do in the future. God Bless these 
students and God Bless the United States of America.

                       Tuesday, October 17, 2023

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this August, I had the 
pleasure of attending Thomas Tran&#x27;s Eagle Scout Court of Honor. Thomas 
has been actively involved in the Scouts since the third grade when he 
joined as a cub scout. He quickly climbed the ranks and became an 
active member of Troop 94, leading the group as their Patrol Leader. 
Since then, he has earned an impressive 28 merit badges for his hard 
work and dedication. The proudest moment of Thomas&#x27;s Scouting journey 
was his Eagle Scout project where Thomas organized the removal and 
replacement of an old billboard welcome sign at the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars Post 8098 in Egg Harbor Township. This massive undertaking 
demanded 130 hours of his time and the South Jersey community is 
thankful for his efforts. God Bless Thomas Tran and God Bless the 
United States of America.
