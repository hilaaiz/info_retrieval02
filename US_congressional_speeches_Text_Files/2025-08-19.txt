                         HONORING GLORIA GLOVER

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
recognize Gloria Glover for her remarkable dedication and service as 
Youth Director at New Green Grove Church of Faith in Greenwood, 
Mississippi. For over 20 years, Ms. Glover has been a steadfast leader, 
guiding and inspiring young people in her community through spiritual 
growth, education, and outreach.
  Under her leadership, the youth ministry has flourished, encompassing 
a praise team, praise dancers, and numerous community service 
initiatives. Ms. Glover, alongside her daughter, LaFonda Knox, and 
youth minister Robert Keyon Beamon, has played an essential role in 
creating a vibrant and supportive environment where young members can 
grow in faith and contribute meaningfully to their community.
  Bishop Milton Glass, pastor of New Green Grove for 30 years, affirms 
that the youth ministry&#x27;s success has been vital to the church&#x27;s growth 
and vitality. Thanks to Ms. Glover&#x27;s tireless efforts, the ministry has 
grown to welcome new young members every month, many of whom have been 
baptized and actively participate in church life.
  The young people under Ms. Glover&#x27;s guidance have dedicated 
themselves to serving others. They have organized and delivered meals 
to seniors, collected and distributed socks and blankets to nursing 
home residents, gathered food for the Community Kitchen and disaster 
victims, and supplied hygiene products to the Delta Correctional 
Facility. Their outreach also includes toy drives supporting children 
during family visits to the prison, reflecting a deep commitment to 
compassion and community service.
  Despite challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and concerns 
over gun violence, Ms. Glover and the youth ministry have persevered, 
fostering a spirit of resilience and faith. Her leadership ensures that 
the church continues to be a beacon of hope and growth, especially for 
the young people who represent its future.
  Today, I commend Gloria Glover for her outstanding commitment to 
empowering youth, strengthening her church, and serving her community. 
Her work exemplifies the profound impact that dedicated individuals can 
have on shaping lives and nurturing the next generation.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Gloria 
Glover&#x27;s exceptional service and lasting legacy.

                HONORING JOAN GROWE ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ANGIE CRAIG

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great Minnesotan, 
Joan Growe, ahead of her 90th birthday on September 28, 2025.
  Born Joan Ruth Anderson in 1935, Joan was introduced to public 
service early in her life. Her father, Arthur Anderson, served as mayor 
of her hometown of Buffalo, Minnesota, where she would later graduate 
from Buffalo High School. She then went on to earn a teaching degree 
from St. Cloud State University and spent the following years giving 
back to her community as a teacher and a homemaker.
  In 1972, Joan launched a bid for an open seat in the Minnesota State 
Legislature. While critics mocked her ``Housewives Campaign&#x27;&#x27;, she 
embraced the network of women she&#x27;d met through the League of Women 
Voters. She met people where they were, attending coffee parties, book 
clubs, and PTA meetings. This coalition carried her to victory, and she 
spent her time in the Minnesota House fighting for election integrity 
and voting access. She championed Minnesota&#x27;s same-day voter 
registration law, the first of its kind in the Nation.
  Her election as secretary of state in 1974 made her the first woman 
in Minnesota&#x27;s history to win a statewide election without prior 
appointment. Her 24-year tenure also made her the second longest 
serving secretary of state in our state&#x27;s history. During this time, 
she found creative ways to encourage voter participation, from voter 
education campaigns to friendly contests between cities. As a result, 
Minnesota was named the Nation&#x27;s ``Votingest State&#x27;&#x27; under her watch--
beginning a legacy of strong voter turnout that continues to this day.
  Since leaving public office, Joan has worked tirelessly to ensure 
that all elections remain accessible and secure. She has been selected 
to serve as an official election observer in various foreign elections 
and served on the advisory committee for the Hubert H. Humphrey 
Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. Her 
expertise in voting and elections is known worldwide, and she continues 
to make our state proud wherever she goes.
  I thank Joan for everything she has done for our shared democratic 
values, for every glass ceiling that she&#x27;s broken, and for being such a 
dear friend. I wish her a Happy Birthday.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the remarkable life and legacy 
of my friend Marc Saltzberg. He passed away peacefully on June 27, 
2025, surrounded by his loving family following a prolonged battle with 
cancer.
  After his retirement from a successful career in information 
technology, Marc dedicated himself to political activism. He became an 
integral member of local advocacy organizations, tirelessly supporting 
causes that he was passionate about. More than just a supporter, Marc 
sought to create spaces for open and thoughtful civil and political 
discourse within his community, fostering engagement at the grassroot 
level in ways that uplifted those around him.
  Born in Chicago, Marc&#x27;s journey took him to Carleton College, where 
he met his beloved wife, Nancy. Their shared passion for travel led 
them to countless adventures as a couple. In their youth, they hiked in 
Nepal, explored Turkey, and cycled in France. In later years, they 
returned to Turkey with their three children, Jenny, Alex, and Maria, 
as a testament to their lifelong sense of wonder and curiosity.
  Marc&#x27;s contributions to his community and to the causes he held dear 
are a true testament to his character. His commitment to the betterment 
of society was unwavering, and he and his family were committed to 
supporting organizations serving communities in need and environmental 
causes. Some of these organizations included Planned Parenthood, the 
American Civil Liberties Union, Doctors Without Borders, the Monterey 
Bay Aquarium and many more. These causes reflected Marc&#x27;s enduring 
belief in justice, compassion, and a better future for all.
  Marc is survived by his wife Nancy, his children Jenny, Alex, and 
Maria, and his grandchildren. May his contributions to serving people 
in need live on through the people and organizations that he touched 
throughout his life.
  Marc was a proud father, grandfather, and dedicated activist. His 
legacy of service and engagement will continue to inspire and guide 
many after him. May his memory be a blessing to all who knew him.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
lifelong educator, community matriarch, and steadfast servant leader, 
Mrs. Monzola Randle Ross of Cruger, Mississippi.
  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``Longevity has its place.&#x27;&#x27; 
That truth finds a shining example in the remarkable career and impact 
of Mrs. Ross, who faithfully served 41 consecutive years with Central 
Mississippi, Inc. Head Start, shaping the lives of more than 2,400 
children across Holmes County.
  Mrs. Ross began her journey in early childhood education as a part-
time secretary at the Holly Grove Head Start Center. Through her 
dedication and love for children, she rose to become a teacher, then 
head teacher, and eventually center manager. Even after the closing of 
Holly Grove, her commitment never wavered. She continued to serve with 
excellence at the Goodman Head Start Center until her recent 
retirement.
  More than an educator, Mrs. Ross was a life-mentor. From her handmade 
brown-paper-bag puppets ``Mr. Do&#x27;&#x27; and ``Mr. Don&#x27;t,&#x27;&#x27; to the life 
lessons she instilled in every classroom, she taught not only ABCs and 
123s, but discipline, respect, and purpose. Her former students have 
gone on to become teachers, entrepreneurs, ministers, realtors, health 
professionals, farmers, public servants, and even Head Start managers 
themselves. In every one of their stories, her legacy endures.
  She holds a national Child Development Associate credential and has 
received numerous awards throughout her career. Yet, her greatest 
reward came from the joy of watching children grow, thrive, and 
succeed--and from the unwavering support of her late husband, Mr. 
Albert Ross, her daughters Rose Berry, Lawanda Ross, and Pamela Wiley, 
and her beloved grandchildren.
  Even in retirement, Mrs. Ross remains a pillar of the Mt. Olive 
Missionary Baptist Church in Lexington, Mississippi, where her 
celebration drew nearly 100 well-wishers--friends, family, and former 
students who came from as far as the West Coast and Chicago. The event 
featured touching tributes, musical performances, and reflections from 
those whose lives she touched most deeply.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and 
celebrating Mrs. Monzola Randle Ross for her extraordinary devotion to 
early childhood education, her love for her community, and her enduring 
legacy of compassion, excellence, and service. Mississippi is better 
because of her.

   HONORING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE URBAN LEAGUE OF NWI AND THE 
                  SERVICE OF DR. VANESSA ALLEN-McCLOUD

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. FRANK J. MRVAN

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I rise to 
recognize the 80th Anniversary of the Urban League of Northwest Indiana 
(NWI) and its invaluable contributions to our region.
  I also congratulate Dr. Vanessa Allen-McCloud on 15 years of service 
as President and CEO of the Urban League of NWI. Leaders and community 
members will gather to proudly celebrate these milestones at the Oak 
Jubilee Celebration at Indiana University Northwest in Gary, Indiana, 
on August 21, 2025.
  On June 25, 1945, the Urban League of Gary was founded with the 
commitment to strive for equal opportunities for all citizens. As an 
affiliate of the National Urban League, the organization was 
established to remove racial barriers that prevented African Americans 
from enjoying equal opportunities in housing, employment, education and 
the many other facets of American life. The Board of Directors later 
reorganized in 1970 as the Urban League of NWI Inc. to better reflect 
their service to communities in Lake, Porter, and LaPorte Counties. For 
80 years, the Urban League of NWI has promoted, encouraged, and 
enhanced services to improve social, educational, and economic 
conditions for African Americans and other minority groups across 
Northwest Indiana. The Urban League of NWI has played a pivotal role in 
the lives of countless residents, including advancing educational 
opportunities for low-income students through its annual scholarship 
fair at Indiana University Northwest.
  The Urban League&#x27;s grand impact on the Region would not be possible 
without its dedicated staff and the exceptional leadership of Dr. 
Vanessa Allen-McCloud. Her contributions as President and CEO over the 
past 15 years exemplify her commitment to civil service, education, and 
her community, serving as an inspiration for all in our region. Dr. 
Allen-McCloud holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Organizational 
Leadership, a Master of Education, and a Doctorate in Educational 
Leadership and Administration. She incorporates her rigorous academic 
background each day to maximize the support that the Urban League 
provides to its surrounding residents. Dr. Allen-McCloud has received 
many prestigious awards for her work in the community and these, along 
with her numerous accomplishments leading the Urban League of NWI 
during the past 15 years, are a testament to her commendable character 
and work ethic.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues 
join me in honoring the Urban League of NWI and Dr. Vanessa Allen-
McCloud on these two notable milestones. Throughout the years, the 
dedicated staff and leaders of the Urban League of NWI have worked 
diligently to expand the opportunities offered to minority groups to 
promote fair access to a successful future, and they deserve great 
recognition for their contributions and commitment to communities 
across Northwest Indiana.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF FORMER FIRST LADY, MRS. ROSALYNN CARTER

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
a former First Lady of the United States, former First Lady of Georgia, 
a devoted wife, loving mother, proud grandmother and great-grandmother, 
tireless advocate, and dear friend, Mrs. Rosalynn Carter. Mrs. Carter 
transitioned from this life on November 19, 2023. On August 18, 2025, a 
wreath was laid at her burial site in Plains, Georgia to commemorate 
her birthday and all she did to serve humankind.
  Rosalynn Carter was born and raised in Plains, Georgia to the union 
of Wilburn Edgar Smith and Frances Allethea ``Allie&#x27;&#x27; Murray Smith. She 
graduated as valedictorian of Plains High School and then attended 
Georgia Southwestern College--now Georgia Southwestern State 
University--in Americus, Georgia where she served as Vice President of 
her class and graduated in 1946. In 1945 she began dating James Earl 
``Jimmy&#x27;&#x27; Carter, Jr., also from Plains and whose family farmed 
peanuts. Jimmy was attending the United States Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, Maryland, at the time. Jimmy and Rosalynn married in Plains 
on July 7, 1946, and they would go on to spend seventy-seven cherished 
years together.
  In 1953, following the death of President Carter&#x27;s father, the 
Carters returned to Plains and Mrs. Carter assumed responsibility for 
bookkeeping at the family peanut farm and established herself as an 
essential part of the business. After Jimmy was elected to the Georgia 
State Senate in 1962, Rosalynn&#x27;s role on the peanut farm grew, 
especially while he traveled to Atlanta for legislative sessions.
  In 1970, Senator Jimmy Carter launched his campaign for governor and 
Rosalynn took a leading role on the campaign trail. In addition to 
handling most of her husband&#x27;s political correspondence and meeting 
with constituents, Mrs. Carter began to travel across the state of 
Georgia to campaign on his behalf. From 1971 to 1975, as First Lady of 
Georgia, she was an equal partner and close advisor to Governor Carter 
and dedicated herself to improving mental health services, serving on 
the Governor&#x27;s Commission to Improve Services for the Mentally and 
Emotionally Handicapped where she formally began working on one of her 
foremost initiatives: improving and breaking the stigma surrounding 
mental health.
  Before returning to Plains, Jimmy had already announced he was 
running for President in the 1976 election. Rosalynn was by his side, 
as always, and hit the road to talk with voters across the country. She 
told people why she believed this soft-spoken, Georgia peanut farmer 
should become president. In November of 1976, Jimmy Carter became 
President-elect of the United States and Rosalynn followed him to the 
White House where she would make her own mark in defining what it meant 
to be America&#x27;s First Lady.
  As First Lady of the United States from 1977 to 1981, Mrs. Carter 
attended Cabinet meetings, worked on domestic policy, and served as 
Honorary Chair of the President&#x27;s Commission on Mental Health. In 1979, 
she testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in support of the 
Mental Health Systems Act, becoming the first First Lady since Eleanor 
Roosevelt to testify before Congress.
  After leaving the White House, Mrs. Carter remained active in 
humanitarian work. She and President Carter devoted decades to Habitat 
for Humanity, where they built and repaired homes in communities around 
the world. In 1982, they founded the Carter Center, a nonprofit human 
rights organization, which has since become famous for its work to 
eradicate disease, strengthen democracies, and alleviate human 
suffering all around the world. In 1987, she established the Rosalynn 
Carter Institute for Caregivers at Georgia Southwestern State 
University, which continues to support those caring for loved ones with 
chronic illnesses or disabilities.
  Over the course of her life, Rosalynn received numerous awards and 
honors, including being inducted into the National Women&#x27;s

[[Page E779]]

Hall of Fame in 2001 and being awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom in 1999, which she was jointly awarded alongside President 
Carter.
  Rosalynn Carter accomplished so much, for so many, for so long. She 
did so with the grace of God as well as the love and support of her 
devoted husband, their five children, and their twenty-two 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
  On a personal note, it has been an honor to know Rosalynn and Jimmy 
Carter for more than half a century. I will always cherish their 
friendship, as well as their sage counsel and advice which has been 
invaluable to me as I have served in Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, 
along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia&#x27;s Second 
Congressional District, in honoring the life and service of Mrs. 
Rosalynn Carter on the occasion of her birthday. We pray for all those 
who continue to mourn her loss.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE EQUAL TREATMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA UNDER

                                 ______

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Equal Treatment of 
the District of Columbia Under the Rural Health Transformation Program 
Act of 2025, which would make the District of Columbia eligible for 
funding under the Rural Health Transformation Program (Program). The 
$50 billion Program was established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act 
(H.R. 1). While the Program&#x27;s title refers to rural health, H.R. 1 
permits the Program&#x27;s funds to be used for health care services, 
providers and technology outside rural areas.
  Senate Republicans, who created the Program, made only the 50 states 
eligible for funding, likely depriving D.C. of hundreds of millions of 
dollars. D.C. is treated as a state for most federal programs because 
D.C. residents pay the same federal taxes as residents of states, and 
there is no reason D.C. should not be eligible for the Program&#x27;s funds.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Land of Make 
Believe being named the ``World&#x27;s Greatest Amusement Park&#x27;&#x27; by the 
nationally televised ``World&#x27;s Greatest! . . .&#x27;&#x27;
  Located in Hope Township, New Jersey, the Land of Make Believe has 
provided lasting entertainment and fun in the Northern New Jersey area 
for over seven decades. Since its founding in 1954 by Herman Maier, the 
park has remained family-owned and operated, with the Maier family 
upholding the same high standards of excellence and service that have 
defined it from the beginning. These high standards also earned the 
Land of Make Believe the award of ``Best Theme Park in New Jersey&#x27;&#x27; by 
MSN.com earlier this summer. Christopher Maier, Herman&#x27;s son and the 
park&#x27;s current owner, credited its most recent achievement to the 
park&#x27;s enduring commitment to affordability, safety, and family-
centered fun.

TRIBUTE TO LISA KAWAMURA--CALIFORNIA&#x27;S 24TH CONGRESSIONAL WOMAN OF THE 
                                  YEAR

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 19, 2025

  Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, each year, through the Women of the Year 
Award, my office extends special recognition to women on the Central 
Coast who have made a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year Award recipient, Lisa 
Kawamura of Arroyo Grande, California.
  For more than 25 years, Lisa has been a dedicated lecturer in the 
Department of Communication Studies at California Polytechnic State 
University, San Luis Obispo. She has taught hundreds of students in 
public speaking, performance studies, and forensics, leaving a lasting 
mark as a mentor and role model. Beyond the classroom, she has served 
as the longtime advisor to the Nikkei Student Union Club, ensuring that 
students have a supportive community and opportunities for leadership.
  Lisa&#x27;s leadership extends well beyond the campus. As President of the 
Cal Poly Chapter of the California Faculty Association and as Chair of 
the statewide Committee on Contract Development and Bargaining 
Strategy, she has been a steadfast advocate for fair pay, equity, and 
improved working conditions for all California State University 
faculty. She also represents her peers on the CFA statewide Board of 
Directors, amplifying the voices of faculty throughout the CSU system. 
Her commitment to equity is evident in her leadership of CalFac&#x27;s Anti-
Racism and Social Justice workshops, which she regularly co-leads 
across California. As a Japanese-American woman and longtime Central 
Coast resident, she brings both lived experience and deep empathy to 
her work, encouraging other women of color to speak up, advocate for 
themselves, and pursue leadership opportunities.
  Lisa&#x27;s service to the Asian, Pacific Islander, and Desi American 
community is equally significant. She is a member of the CFA APIDA 
Caucus and previously served as Chair, working to advance visibility 
and representation at Cal Poly and across the CSU system. She is also 
active with Tsuru for Solidarity, a social justice organization 
dedicated to supporting immigrant rights and providing healing spaces 
for those impacted by incarceration--both historically during World War 
II and in the present day.
  Lisa Kawamura is well known for her kindness, availability, and 
integrity. She is ``only a phone call away&#x27;&#x27; for her colleagues and 
students, and she consistently uplifts others by making sure their 
voices are heard. She has become a trusted mentor, dynamic public 
speaker, and respected leader in the Central Coast community.
  I am honored to recognize Lisa Kawamura for her lifelong commitment 
to education, equity, and justice. I ask all Members to join me today 
in honoring an exceptional woman of California&#x27;s 24th Congressional 
District, Lisa Kawamura, for her outstanding service to her students, 
colleagues, and community.
