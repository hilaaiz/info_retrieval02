               COMMEMORATING THE CITY OF RICHMOND HEIGHTS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. CORI BUSH

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 22, 2023

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to commemorate the 110th 
anniversary of the City of Richmond Heights, located in Missouri&#x27;s 
First District. Richmond Heights was incorporated on December 29, 1913 
with just 18 families residing in the area. Since then, the population 
has grown to 9,286.
  Richmond Heights has been home to many Missourians who brought the 
joys of art and music to St. Louis, such as jazz singer Mae Wheeler, 
rock-n-roll legend Chuck Berry, artist Ernest Trova, gospel singer 
Doris Fiddmont Frazier, architect Henry Hampton, and filmmaker Henry 
Hampton Jr. Moreover, Richmond Heights is home to many impactful social 
justice advocates such as Dr. Thomas E. Rusan, Jr., Georgia Tallier 
Rusan, and Rev. James E. Fiddmont. It is also home to one of the most 
recognizable voices in St. Louis, the legendary sports commentator, 
Jack Buck.
  Richmond Heights enriches Missouri&#x27;s First District with community 
institutions such as the Esquire Theater, Tropicana Lanes, SSM Health 
St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, the Saint Louis Galleria, and the Boulevard. It 
includes four school districts: the Maplewood Richmond Heights School 
District, Clayton School District, Brentwood School District and Ladue 
School District, as well as Little Flower, Immaculata School, and the 
International Schoolhouse.
  As the Congresswoman for Missouri&#x27;s First District, I congratulate 
the residents of Richmond Heights and their current leadership, 
including Mayor Jim Thomson and Councilmembers Lisa Eppert, Greg 
Vescovo, Reginald Finney, Maurice Muia, Megan Moylan, Ashley Metcalf, 
Danny Hebenstreit and Scott Huston on 110 fruitful years. Here&#x27;s to 110 
more.

                       Friday, December 22, 2023

  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the service of 
Saisha White, my legislative assistant who has dedicated her time to 
serving the people of Florida&#x27;s 24th Congressional District.
  A Cleveland native, Saisha moved to Florida to obtain her law degree 
at Florida A&amp;M University after obtaining her bachelor&#x27;s at Miami 
University. Her time in law school inspired her passion to secure 
equity and opportunities across marginalized communities.
  Saisha came to my office ready to make a difference. She worked her 
way up to becoming my legislative assistant, handling my Transportation 
&amp; Infrastructure Committee work. In her time as my legislative 
assistant, she managed my proposed legislation, amendments--many of 
which were included in critical legislation and advocated for critical 
issues to better the lives of those across the country.
  Known for her dedication to giving back and empowering others, one of 
Saisha&#x27;s greatest attributes is her selflessness. Her willingness to 
continually give back is one of her many attributes that will 
inevitably result in success in this field.
  Saisha&#x27;s heart is dedicated to equity for Black and brown 
communities, and she is moving on from my office to continue that work. 
Upon transitioning from my office, Saisha will go on to advocate for 
safer communities, criminal justice reform, and civil rights access for 
marginalized communities.
  On behalf of Florida&#x27;s 24th Congressional District, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring Saisha White for her drive and 
dedication to public service.

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Senator Jim Perry for 
his great service to the state of North Carolina and to offer my best 
wishes as he enters the next chapter of his career.
  Earlier this month, Jim announced that he would not file for re-
election for the North Carolina Senate after serving three terms. Jim 
has served in the state senate since 2019, and in that time, did much 
to support his constituents of the 2nd district and the state as a 
whole. He is a staunch supporter of North Carolina&#x27;s agricultural 
industry, rural communities as well as our military personnel. What&#x27;s 
more--Jim is a leader within the Senate itself, currently serving as 
Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and is a Member of the 
Committees on Commerce and Insurance Health Care, Redistricting and 
Elections and Rules and Operations of the Senate. In his time, he&#x27;s 
served in leadership roles on numerous other Committees. Furthermore, 
he also serves as Majority Whip, to which he was elected unanimously 
during his first term in office.
  Jim is a born and bred son of North Carolina, great American and dear 
friend. Jim&#x27;s dedication to service and constant willingness to step up 
when needed is commendable and inspiring. It has been an honor serving 
the people of North Carolina alongside him and I wish him the best in 
all his future endeavors.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Senator Jim Perry 
for his service to our community and the great state of North Carolina.

            TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF MICHAEL ELLIOTT FOX

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANNA G. ESHOO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 22, 2023

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of 
Michael E. Fox, Sr., a strong force for good in the South Bay who died 
on November 3, 2023, at the age of 87.
  Michael Fox was born in Chicago on September 23, 1936 and attended 
Bishop Quarter Military Academy there, Campion Jesuit High School in 
Wisconsin, graduated from Notre Dame University in Indiana, and earned 
a degree in Brewing Science and Technology from the Siebel Institute of 
Technology in Chicago. He met his wife Mary Ellen in Illinois, and the 
couple moved to California. They bought a home in Saratoga in 1965 and 
acquired a small beer distributorship, which grew from 10 employees to 
more than 200 during 50 years of business.
  Michael Fox and Mary Ellen were renowned for their extraordinary 
philanthropy, and he held leadership roles in countless charitable

[[Page E1260]]

organizations. His good works earned him accolades such as Santa Clara 
County Philanthropist of the Year, two Papal awards, and an Honorary 
Degree of Doctor of Public Service from Santa Clara University.
  Mike Fox was deeply devoted to his family and his Catholic faith, and 
his commitment to both inspired his life and brought him great joy. He 
was kind and affable and mentored many people over the years, ran 
marathons and loved Broadway musicals. Any cause that would uplift 
others became his cause.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring the life and work of Michael Fox, and in extending our most 
sincere condolences to his entire family. He was a good man who did 
great things to better our communities and strengthen our country. Mike 
Fox was a national treasure.
