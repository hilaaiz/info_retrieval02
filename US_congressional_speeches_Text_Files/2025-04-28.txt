                         HONORING PETER PEARSON

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 28, 2025

  Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Peter 
Pearson, a 57-year resident of New Jersey&#x27;s 7th Congressional District, 
who recently passed away at the age of 83. Residing in the town of 
Andover, he was elected member of the Andover Regional Board of 
Education from 1984 to 1996 and later as an Andover Borough Councilman 
from 2002 to 2022. Additionally, Mr. Pearson served as comptroller for 
multiple small businesses and as the School Business Administrator for 
several of the surrounding school districts for over 25 years. Mr. 
Pearson was always ready to help with anything that would better his 
community and will be remembered for his kind personality and 
dedication to serving those around him. I am honored to be able to 
recognize such a dedicated and thoughtful resident of my district.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 28, 2025

  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, alongside my colleague Rep. 
Dan Newhouse, to honor the life and legacy of Washington&#x27;s former 
Secretary of Health Mary Selecky, who we both had the honor of serving 
besides in former Governor Christine Gregoire&#x27;s cabinet. For over four 
decades, Mary dedicated her life and career to improving public health 
across Washington. She began her career as the administrator for the 
Northeast Tri County Health District. In 1999, she was appointed as the 
Secretary of Health by Governor Gary Locke and continued in that role 
under Governors Gregoire and Jay Inslee until her retirement in 2013.
  During her tenure as Washington&#x27;s Secretary of Health, Mary was 
instrumental in reducing smoking rates and increasing childhood 
vaccination coverage across the state. She was known for her commitment 
to preventive care and for strengthening the collaboration between 
state and local health agencies. In 2020, during the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, the state drew on Mary&#x27;s commitment to preparedness 
for a public health emergency. During our time in the cabinet with her, 
we valued her expertise, tenacity, and mentorship that she provided to 
all.
  Beyond her professional accomplishments, Mary was deeply connected to 
her community in Colville, Washington, where she resided for over 50 
years. Her dedication to both her local community and the broader 
public health landscape left a lasting impact on the state. Mr. 
Speaker, we ask our colleagues to join us in honoring Mary Selecky&#x27;s 
life and contributions to public health, as well as Washington.

      HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MS. CHIQUITA MICHELE GREENE

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 28, 2025

  Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the 
extraordinary life and legacy of Ms. Chiquita Michele Greene--a devoted 
educator, trailblazer, and servant leader from Southwest Georgia. Her 
unwavering commitment to her students and the greater community has 
profoundly touched countless lives across Georgia and the Nation. 
Sadly, Ms. Greene transitioned from labor to reward on April 6, 2025. A 
celebration of her life was held on Monday, April 14, 2025, at Unity 
Baptist Church in Sylvester, Georgia.
  Ms. Greene was born from the union of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur L. and 
Earnestine Greene. Raised in Sylvester, Georgia, Ms. Greene embodied 
academic excellence, purpose, and pride in her heritage from an early 
age. A 1995 graduate of Worth County High School, she made history as 
the first African American member of the school&#x27;s dance team--an early 
indicator of the pioneering spirit that would define her life&#x27;s work.
  After high school, Ms. Greene attended Albany State University (ASU), 
earning her bachelor&#x27;s degree in Early Childhood Education and later 
pursued advanced degrees in education at Wheelock College, Walden 
University, Georgia Southern University, and Northcentral University. 
She was a lifelong learner who transformed her knowledge into service, 
becoming a beacon of empowerment for students and colleagues alike.
  As a teacher in the Dougherty County School System (DCSS), she poured 
her passion into every classroom she entered--most notably at Albany 
Early College and Westover High School, where she was named the 2018-
2019 Teacher of the Year and a finalist for the district-wide honor. 
Over her career, she served with distinction in multiple Georgia school 
districts, including Savannah-Chatham and Glynn counties, holding 
leadership positions such as English Department Chair, Instructional 
Coach, Graduation Coach, and more. She also advised student teams, 
including the Black History Quiz Bowl, Delta GEMS, and EMBODI, helping 
to cultivate a sense of school pride, heritage, and academic excellence 
among the students at the institutions she supported.
  Ms. Greene&#x27;s service extended well beyond the school walls where she 
worked. She was a fierce advocate for her community and a 
transformational leader within numerous civic and social organizations. 
She served as President of the Albany, Georgia Alumnae Chapter of Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., where under her leadership, the chapter 
earned national Red Ribbon recognition. She championed historical 
preservation, helping to secure a mayoral proclamation honoring Delta 
Sigma Theta cofounder, Osceola Macarthy Adams, and initiated a petition 
for a historical marker in her name. She also served as co-advisor to 
the Delta Rho Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. at her 
beloved alma mater, Albany State University.
  Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm once said that ``Service is the 
rent we pay for the space we occupy on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; Ms. Chiquita 
Michele Greene paid her rent and continued going the extra mile to give 
her time and efforts to benefit others. Ms. Greene held leadership 
roles in the National Council of Negro Women, the ASU Alumni 
Association, Ma Flora&#x27;s Helping Hands, the Marching Rams Show Band 
National Alumni Association, the Worth County NAACP, and several other 
civic, educational, and fraternal organizations. She was a mentor to 
many and a pillar of strength, especially in spaces dedicated

[[Page E352]]

to uplifting young women, promoting scholarship, and preserving Black 
heritage.
  Among her numerous accolades were the 2021 Trellis Cuffie Volunteer 
Award; the 2021 Multicultural Award from the Georgia Council of 
Teachers of English; the Distinguished Delta Award; 2017 Albany State 
University ``A Future to Fulfill&#x27;&#x27; Award; Leadership Academy for Women 
of Small-town America--Class of 2016; 2007 Caring Person in the 
Community- Brunswick, Georgia; 2016 DCSS Leadership Academy Selectee; 
and recognition as one of Albany State University&#x27;s 50 Under 50. These 
honors are a testament to a life lived with purpose and service at the 
forefront.
  None of Ms. Greene&#x27;s momentous accomplishments and contributions 
would have been possible without the enduring love and support of her 
God, her family, and her beloved friends across the state of Georgia. 
She is survived by many loved ones, including her parents: Mr. and Mrs. 
Arthur L. and Earnestine B. Greene; grandparent: Mr. Lacy Lee Smith; 
siblings: Buffy; Daryl D. Warren; and Riccardo C. Greene; many nieces 
and nephews; a host of aunts, uncles, cousins, and beloved friends.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the 
more than 765,000 people of Georgia&#x27;s Second Congressional District in 
honoring the life and legacy of Ms. Chiquita Michele Greene and in 
extending our deepest sympathies to her family, friends, colleagues, 
and all those who mourn her tragic loss. We pray that all will be 
consoled by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, 
and months ahead.

               HONORING THE LIFE OF EDNA BELLE PEMBERTON

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JASMINE CROCKETT

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 28, 2025

  Ms. CROCKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Edna Belle 
Pemberton, a beloved mother, grandmother, community leader, and a 
tireless advocate for positive change in the Oak Cliff community and 
beyond. Born on March 27, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois, Edna was the 
youngest of nine children. After losing her mother at a young age and 
growing up in the foster care system, she became a fierce advocate for 
her community and a force for good, committed to improving the lives of 
those around her. Edna&#x27;s earthly journey ended on April 13, 2025, at 
the age of 81.
  Edna met the love of her life, the late DarNell Pemberton, while 
attending church as a teenager. The couple&#x27;s bond grew into a strong 
partnership, and they married on September 19, 1964. Together, Edna and 
DarNell raised four daughters and, in a remarkable act of love and 
dedication, adopted and helped raise eight of Edna&#x27;s nieces, nephews, 
and young relatives. Their family of fourteen lived in California 
before relocating to Dallas, where they settled in the Oak Cliff 
neighborhood, where Edna&#x27;s advocacy continued to grow.
  A dedicated voice for the people of southern Dallas, Edna began her 
career at Kmart, where she worked her way up from stockroom employee to 
management, leading various community initiatives and supply drives 
along the way. Her efforts to enact a youth curfew to improve safety, 
extend bus lines to provide better access to services, and save the 
Southwest Center Mall, formerly known as Red Bird Mall, stand as 
testament to her determination to make a positive impact on her city.
  Edna was an active member of many local organizations, including the 
Dallas chapter of the NAACP, the Martin Luther King Center, and Camp 
Wisdom Now. She was a founder of Positively Oak Cliff, a nonprofit 
coalition of entrepreneurs and community leaders, and served as a voter 
registrar and the precinct chair of her local precinct. Edna received 
several Governors&#x27; awards for her contributions to her community, and 
she was honored to serve as a torchbearer in Dallas ahead of the 1996 
Olympic Games.
  Known affectionately as ``Mrs. P,&#x27;&#x27; Edna was not only a community 
leader but a mother-figure and mentor to many. She personified her 
faith in her daily life as an active and longtime member of Concord 
Missionary Baptist Church, where she made an immeasurable impact. Her 
compassion for others, especially during times of disaster and 
financial hardship, made a lasting difference in the lives of countless 
individuals.
  Above all, Edna Pemberton cherished spending time with her family. 
Her unwavering love and support for her children, who have gone on to 
become educators, community leaders, and volunteers, serve as a shining 
example of the dedicated spirit and servant heart she poured into those 
around her. She was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and friend to 
many, and her legacy of compassion, resilience, and community service 
will live on in the hearts of all who were fortunate enough to have 
known her.
  Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincerest condolences to Edna&#x27;s family, her 
friends, and the Oak Cliff and wider Dallas community. May her 
extraordinary legacy of service, love, and dedication continue to 
inspire future generations.

a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives. This

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. John 
``Johnny&#x27;&#x27; Rothfus of Prosper, Texas, and present him with the 
Congressional Patriot Award. Johnny has dedicated himself to faithfully 
serving our community and country.
  Johnny was born in Sachse, Texas, and moved with his family to 
Prosper at a young age. In 1943, he graduated high school and joined 
the United States Army Air Forces the following year. Johnny served as 
a tail gunner on a B-24 bomber and was briefly stationed overseas for 
six months. As a result of his meritorious service, he received the 
Purple Heart, an Air Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, the European-African-
Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one silver battle star, and the Good 
Conduct Medal with one overseas bar. Johnny completed his service in 
1947 and later fulfilled an advertisement recruiting firefighters. For 
two decades, he drove a fire engine, and he retired in November 1974.
  Johnny&#x27;s incredible career as an aviator turned first responder is 
remarkable to witness. After returning from overseas, he married in 
1945. Johnny has one daughter and many more grandchildren and great-
grandchildren. He enjoys spending time with his family and building and 
painting homes in his free time. Johnny has remained a devoted man of 
faith, and he regularly attends First Christian Church in Celina. I am 
proud to commemorate Johnny for a lifetime of contributions to our 
country, as he has been steadfast in his service to his community, be 
it at the senior center or drug store. I wish him good health for many 
years to come.
  It is an honor to bestow Johnny with the Patriot Award for his 
exceptional service to the people of North Texas.

                    REMEMBERING VICTOR KILLINGSWORTH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 28, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and heroic 
service of Mr. Victor Killingsworth of Taft, California. Victor, a 
veteran of World War II, served our country in the U.S. Navy for over 
three years and made incredible contributions to the Taft community. 
Victor passed away on April 5, 2025, at the age of 104.
  Victor was born on November 11, 1921, in Coalinga, California, to 
Francis and Evelena Killingsworth. Shortly thereafter, Francis and 
Evelena would move to Taft, California, which would become Victor&#x27;s 
home for over 90 years. After graduating from Taft High School and 
later Taft College, Victor enrolled in the University of California, 
Berkley. While studying there, the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred, 
causing the United States to formally enter World War II. Eager to 
defend his country, Victor enlisted in the U.S. Navy at a time when 
Japanese and German naval attacks had stretched American naval forces 
precariously thin. Victor sought to be a more valuable asset to the 
Navy and enrolled in Midshipman School at Columbia University on 
December 7, 1942. Industrious American shipbuilders soon remedied the 
ship shortage with remarkable speed, enabling Victor to later serve in 
the campaigns against Imperial Japan in the Pacific Ocean. During his 
naval training, while at Joint Expeditionary Base--Little Creek, Victor 
met his future wife Margaret (Peggy) Sexton who would keep his morale 
high with frequent devoted letters throughout the war.
  Upon completion of Midshipman School, Victor received orders to be 
assigned to the USS Sumter, a troop transport ship, carrying elements 
of the 4th Marine Division. Assigned to a U.S. Navy Amphibious Squad, 
Victor worked to transport ``Carlson&#x27;s Raiders&#x27;&#x27; to Kwajalein Atoll in 
the Marshall Islands in February 1944. He would transport Marines onto 
the six-square mile atoll throughout a fierce four-day battle as part 
of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign. In the pouring rain and 
amidst choppy surf, Victor towed Marine landing forces behind him to 
the beach like ``ducklings&#x27;&#x27; as he recalled. Victor later noted that 
his audaciousness in landing so close to enemy positions at night 
seemed to have tricked the Japanese defenders into thinking his boat 
was one of theirs.
  Victor next took part in the operation to capture the island of 
Saipan. While on the island, Victor drove too far into enemy lines 
where he witnessed tremendous human suffering on the island. In one 
location in Saipan, he would successfully urge numerous Japanese 
soldiers to lay down their arms by promising the men they would be 
treated with civility. Adopting similar de-escalation strategies with 
civilians he encountered, Victor&#x27;s compassion saved many from 
perishing.
  Upon completion of U.S. operations in Saipan in late July 1944, 
Victor transported--in just one day--some 8,000 Marines in 75 boatloads 
across three miles of open ocean to secure the Japanese-held island of 
Tinian in the Northern Mariana Islands. This vital island would later 
provide the two airfields necessary for American bombers to quickly 
reach Japan and bring about the culmination of World War II.
  Later in 1944, Victor served as a Communications Officer aboard the 
USS Artemis. While onboard at the onset of the heroic Battle of Iwo 
Jima in February 1945, the USS Artemis sustained withering fire from 
Japanese coastal artillery and was forced to withdraw to Guam. This was 
Victor&#x27;s final combat of World War II, as the war would end seven 
months later on September 2, 1945. Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant, 
Victor was honorably discharged, married Peggy, and returned to his 
hometown of Taft.
  The couple ran Taft Sporting Goods for 37 years while raising their 
three daughters--Barbara, Janet, and Patty. Victor was passionate about 
supporting his community, helping launch Westside Little League and 
Westside Jr. Football. Later in life, Victor wrote a book about his 
service titled ``The Gator Navy,&#x27;&#x27; where he detailed stories of his 
training and service. Cementing his local legacy, Victor conceived of 
the idea to construct the iconic Oil Worker Monument in Taft, the 
largest bronze statue west of the Mississippi River, to mark the 
centennial anniversary of the city. Whether it was his service to our 
country or our community, Victor has certainly left a lasting impact on 
countless individuals. The Taft community remains fortunate and 
grateful to have had such a hero.
  Victor is survived by his daughters: Patty Killingsworth Gray, 
Barbara Killingsworth, and Janet Killingsworth Sandoval; his sons-in-
law: Everett Gray and Miguel Sandoval; five grandchildren: Christian 
Gray, Ashley Gray, John Gray, Sarah Sandoval, and Andrew Sandoval; and 
eight great-grandchildren: Samantha Gray, Andrew Gray, Piper Gray, 
Foster Gray, Lex Gray, Charlotte Sandoval, Victoria Sandoval, and 
Oliver Sandoval.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in remembering Victor Killingsworth, and his legacy of 
invaluable service to both our country and his community.
