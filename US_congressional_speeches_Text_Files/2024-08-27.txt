                     HONORING KRIS BERTRAND-GLOMSKI

                                 ______

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate a Hoosier who 
has not only faced the adversity that afflicts the lives of soldiers 
after service but has been able to overcome those obstacles. The 
culmination of Kris Bertrand-Glomski&#x27;s experiences and perseverance has 
guided her efforts to enact the change our military women and men 
deserve to see in our community.
  Kris first answered the call to serve her country in 1989 and served 
in the Navy until 1993. With a Bachelor of Social Work from Indiana 
University, a Master of Science in Vocational Rehabilitation, and a 
certificate in Mental Health Counseling from Butler University, she has 
since put her expertise into providing steadfast support to the 
Indianapolis veteran community.
  Working at the federal and state levels, Kris has impacted the day-
to-day lives of others as a member of multiple organizations, such as 
the Department of Veterans Affairs and most recently Indiana&#x27;s Veteran 
Service Office. Seeking to bridge this important work across Indiana, 
she established the Hoosier Women Veterans Program and was instrumental 
in the passing of the Women Veterans Program bill.
  Kris is a shining example of lifelong advocacy. Her efforts to 
provide resources for women veterans have garnered numerous accolades, 
such as the Torchbearer Award and, more recently, the HUMANA 
scholarship to continue learning how to best assist her fellow 
veterans.
  Often, women veterans tend to be underrecognized for their efforts 
and impact. Beginning with its namesake, the Sheila Corcoran Hoosier 
Women Hero Award was created to highlight exemplary Hoosier women 
veterans whose service to their community and Nation is unparalleled. 
Therefore, it is with great pleasure to commend and uplift our Hoosier 
women veterans who proudly, continuously serve our people, community, 
and Nation.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Kris Bertrand-Glomski. 
I thank her for her service.

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Seaman First Class 
Francis Alfred Piche, United States Navy veteran of World War II.
  Francis Piche was born in Troy, New York, on May 12, 1927. He was 
raised and attended school in Troy until he enlisted in the United 
States Navy on June 26, 1944, serving as Seaman First Class. He was 
stationed stateside in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and in 
Long Island, New York, before the USS Oklahoma City was called into 
action. He served aboard the Cleveland-class light cruiser for 
operations in support of the Okinawa campaign and continued action 
against the Japanese islands.
  At the end of hostilities, he was part of the patrol off the coast of 
Japan and the subsequent occupation. Upon returning to the United 
States, Piche was honorably discharged in July 1946 and was awarded the 
World War II Victory Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific 
Campaign Medal with two bronze service stars, and the Navy Occupation 
Service Medal for his service.
  After leaving the Navy, Francis reentered civilian life and pursued a 
career with the Ford Motor Company in Green Island, New York. He worked 
as a floor inspector for two decades before retiring in 1977. During 
his free time, Francis served as a communicant at St. Joseph&#x27;s Church 
and was a loyal member of the American Legion Legnard-Curtin Post 927. 
Francis married his wife Audrey in 1946 and together they had six 
children, Francis, Colleen, Laurie, Paul, Diane, and David. He enjoyed 
spending time with his family, which grew to include twenty-four 
grandchildren and many great-grandchildren.
  Francis&#x27; dedication and service to the United States is truly 
remarkable. On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, I am honored to 
recognize his extraordinary life.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor a 
remarkable leader, Fire Chief Mike Starr, who has dedicated 27 years of 
his life to serving and protecting the citizens of Southlake, Texas. In 
1997, Starr joined the Southlake Fire Department, working as a 
firefighter and paramedic. As a result of his unwavering dedication and 
commitment, he rose through the ranks, taking on the positions of 
driver, engineer, and captain of operations. Then, in 2008, Starr 
earned the title of Fire Chief, a role he has used to make a lasting 
impact in North Texas.
  During his tenure as Fire Chief, Mike Starr led the department 
through a period of significant growth and transformation. Under his 
leadership, the department expanded its personnel from 45 to 74 members 
and oversaw the openings of Station 1 DPS Headquarters and the Station 
3 North training facility. Chief Starr&#x27;s vision and commitment to 
excellence have been the driving force behind these achievements, 
ensuring that the fire department not only meets but exceeds the needs 
of our growing community. Throughout his distinguished career, Chief 
Starr has embodied what it means to be a true leader. His dedication 
and hard work have been recognized through numerous honors, including 
the Teamwork Award in 1998 and the Director&#x27;s Award in 2006. In 2007, 
he was named Firefighter of the Year, a testament to his outstanding 
service.
  Chief Starr has always focused on leading and developing a department 
that models best-in-class service delivery. In the Fire Department&#x27;s 
2023 annual report, Chief Starr highlighted the importance of 
continuous improvement through daily ``quick drills&#x27;&#x27; for line 
personnel, ensuring operational effectiveness and preparedness. His 
leadership has been invaluable, and as Southlake City Manager Alison 
Ortowski noted, his guidance has been instrumental in navigating the 
challenges of growing a fire department while maintaining the highest 
standards of service.
  As Chief Starr prepares to retire at the end of August, it is both an 
honor and a privilege to recognize his 27 years of exemplary service. I 
would like to extend my deepest gratitude for his contributions and 
wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Texas-24 Hometown 
Hero, Sandy Lauder. Over the last two decades, Sandy has spent 
thousands of hours volunteering in the Richardson community. He has 
been a dedicated volunteer with Richardson Police Department&#x27;s 
Volunteers in Police Service program for nearly 17 years, along with

Sandy still serves on the board of the Citizen Police Academy Alumni 
Association.
  In 2015, Sandy joined the Richardson Community Band where he plays a

classics for Richardson Senior Center, retirement homes, community 
fairs, and the Dallas VA Hospital. Sandy also teaches English and 
citizenship classes at Woodcreek Church in Richardson as part of the 
Building English Skills Together program. Previously, he served as 
president of his homeowner&#x27;s association, and he currently coordinates 
his neighborhood&#x27;s crime watch patrol.
  Sandy&#x27;s community involvement spans beyond Richardson city limits. 
For 20 years, he has volunteered as a DFW Airport Ambassador, greeting 
international guests and answering their questions. According to the 
DFW Airport Customer Programs Coordinator, Sandy ``has been a superhero 
coming to the aid of millions of travelers through his service. He is 
kind and helpful to all who work around him and he rarely misses a 
shift.&#x27;&#x27; At 91 years young, he credits his longevity to ``staying 
positive and volunteering.&#x27;&#x27; In his own words, ``It&#x27;s never too late to 
enjoy life and serve your fellow man.&#x27;&#x27;
  I&#x27;d like to thank Sandy Lauder for going above and beyond to serve 
our North Texas community.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate a 
pillar of public service, James Bartelli of Waterford, Connecticut. 
James is retiring this year as the Director of Utilities from the 
Waterford Utility Commission after 39 years of dedicated service. His 
almost four decades of outstanding expertise and dedication to his 
community will be sorely missed.
  James&#x27;s professional career has been defined by his service to the 
community. James began his journey with the Waterford Utility 
Commission in 1985 when he started as a sewer maintainer and has worked 
his way up from apprentice to director. From a young age, James was 
able to apply and develop his specialized knowledge and caring 
disposition to a range of different positions with the Utility 
Commission.
  James has since remained a dutiful protector of his community in 
Waterford, serving in many different capacities with the Waterford 
Utility Commission. Given his steadfastness, James was promoted several 
times within the Utility Commission, quickly moving up the ranks. He 
spent more than 20 years as the Assistant Director, making changes for 
staff and customers of the Waterford Utility Commission that enhanced 
the community.
  His valuable contributions to Waterford residents in all situations 
were recognized time and time again and he achieved the position of 
Director, a position he has dutifully held for the past two years. 
James&#x27;s dedication to his work is evident in his demonstrated 
enthusiasm to jump into action in any scenario no matter how complex, 
working through bad weather, budget crises, and anything in between.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent constituents like James 
Bartelli. James has been an exceptional public servant throughout his 
life, and he is deserving of a relaxing retirement. James&#x27;s nearly 40 
years of unwavering dedication to the Waterford community will leave a 
legacy for years to come. He will leave behind an expert skill set and 
enthusiasm that will be hard to replace. We can take solace in the 
knowledge that James&#x27;s tireless work will continue to be felt in 
Waterford for decades to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing James Bartelli&#x27;s immeasurable contributions and 
congratulating him on his well-earned retirement.

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the United States 
veterans and siblings of the Kelly family of Rensselaer County, New

  The bravery and integrity of each of the Kelly Siblings serves as a

New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I am honored to recognize their 
extraordinary personal sacrifices.

108th Infantry Regiment was constituted in the New York National Guard 
as the 3d New York Volunteer Infantry. The regiment was organized from 
existing companies in Northern and Central New York. The unit first 
began federal service on May 17, 1898, at Camp Black, New York, serving 
with distinction during the Spanish-American War. On December 22, 1898, 
the regiment was reorganized into the 1st Infantry Battalion in Niagara 
Falls, the 2nd Infantry Battalion in Geneva, and the 3rd Infantry 
Battalion in Oswego.
  Charlie Company 2-108 served honorably in many of the defining 
conflicts of the twentieth century. During World War I, the regiment 
was reorganized and redesignated on October 1, 1917, as the 108th 
Infantry Regiment and assigned to the 27th Division. The 108th Infantry 
Regiment aided allied forces in the Somme Offensive in France and at 
Ypres-Lys and Flanders Field in Belgium. In World War II, Charlie 
Company saw action throughout the Pacific Theater, fighting on the 
Bismarck Archipelago, Leyte, Luzon, and across the Southern Philippines 
and the Ryukyu Islands. For their service in the Philippines, the 
Company was awarded the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation in July 
1945.
  For many years, Charlie Company 2-108 has been deployed to critical 
missions in the Middle East. The unit was deployed to Iraq in 2004 as 
part of the 1st Infantry Division and played a pivotal role in securing 
the city of Samarra. They were later recognized with the Valorous Unit 
Award for their accomplishments. In 2012, Charlie Company was deployed 
to Afghanistan as part of Task Force Iron. In 2024, Charlie Company 
participated in African Lion, U.S. Africa Command&#x27;s largest joint 
exercise on the continent.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, I am proud to recognize the 
distinguished service of the men and women of Charlie Company, 2nd

Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment. Their unwavering dedication to the 
United States has forged a historic example of exceptional bravery and 
reflects great credit upon themselves, the New York National Guard, and 
the United States Army.

            HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF HARRISON FREER

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Harrison Freer, the 
Ward 2 Town of Queensbury Board Member, a retired Air Force Colonel and 
pilot, community activist, and avid environmentalist. Harrison Freer 
was a community leader known for his dedication and commitment to each 
endeavor he undertook.
  Harrison served in the United States Air Force for 24 years, retiring 
as a Colonel. Following his distinguished military career, he began

       INTRODUCTION OF THE CONGRESS LEADS BY EXAMPLE ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Congress Leads by 
Example Act of 2024, which would apply to the legislative branch many 
of the laws that protect employees in the private sector and the 
executive branch. Congress should abide by the laws it imposes on 
others.
  In 1995, Congress passed the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 
(CAA), which applied 13 existing civil rights, labor and workplace 
safety and health laws to the legislative branch. In 2018, after 
reports of sexual harassment in Congress and in light of the #MeToo 
movement, Congress passed the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 
Reform Act (Reform Act), which changed the name of the Office of 
Compliance to the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR), 
revised the process to resolve workplace claims and extended CAA 
protections to unpaid staff, interns, and fellows. It also made Members 
of Congress personally liable for their own violations of workplace 
harassment and retaliation laws.
  The CAA and the Reform Act were important steps in making the 
legislative branch accountable for its employment practices, but they 
did not finish the job. As noted, the CAA brought the legislative 
branch under 13 existing civil rights, labor and workplace safety and 
health laws but it omitted important substantive and procedural 
protections. In its three most recent Section 102(b) biennial reports 
to Congress, OCWR identified additional federal workplace laws and 
procedures that should apply to the legislative branch. This bill takes 
into account OCWR&#x27;s recommendations, and seeks both to apply the 
standard of fairness for employees of the legislative branch that 
Congress requires for other employees and provide a safer work 
environment for the legislative branch and visitors by bringing the 
legislative branch obligations in line with the legal requirements for 
the private sector and the executive branch.
  This bill provides general whistleblower protections and anti-
retaliation measures and makes additional Occupational Safety and 
Health Act (OSHA) retaliation provisions applicable to the legislative 
branch. This bill also provides subpoena authority to OCWR to conduct 
inspections and investigations into OSHA violations. It also provides 
extended paid parental bereavement leave to legislative branch 
employees.
  This bill also furthers the CAA&#x27;s goal of preventing workplace 
discrimination in the legislative branch by prohibiting the legislative 
branch from making adverse employment decisions based on an employee&#x27;s 
wage garnishment or involvement in bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to 
the Consumer Credit Protection Act or Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy 
code.
  Finally, this bill bolsters the CAA&#x27;s recordkeeping requirements. It 
applies to the legislative branch the obligation to maintain accurate 
records of safety information and employee injuries, as otherwise 
required by OSHA, as well as employee records necessary to administer 
anti-discrimination laws.
  This bill would help restore the public&#x27;s trust in Congress by 
redoubling our efforts to exercise leadership by example. I urge 
support for this bill.

 RECOGNIZING THE SUCCESS OF DOLLY PARTON&#x27;S IMAGINATION LIBRARY IN THE 
                           STATE OF MISSOURI

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the 
success of Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library in the State of Missouri. 
This new initiative increases literacy and education among our state&#x27;s 
youth and will foster an invaluable love of reading for our state&#x27;s 
precious youth. I express my deepest gratitude to Dolly Parton and the 
State of Missouri for bringing this program to the youngest 
constituents in my district.
  Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library delivers books monthly to 
children&#x27;s homes from their birth until their fifth birthday. For the 
children and their families receiving the books, the program is 
completely free. In Missouri, this program thrives thanks to the 
generosity of Dolly, nearly 60 affiliates and legislation passed by the 
state to establish and administer Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library 
for all children in Missouri 0 to 5 years old.
  In 1995, Dolly Parton--already an award-winning and chart-topping 
artist--established an Imagination Library in her home county in 
Tennessee, inspired by her father who could not read. Since then, the 
program boasts recipients from five countries around the world. As of 
this year, it has delivered over 250 million books to over 3 million 
young children. Dolly is an incredible philanthropist, and her record 
of community service is as vast and acclaimed as her career as an 
international musical phenomenon. We are thankful to have our very own 
Imagination Library here to continue inspiring future generations of 
leaders through literacy.
  Though Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library has been an ``Unlikely 
Angel&#x27;&#x27; in helping our state advance early childhood literacy, the 
establishment of the Missouri Imagination Library

[[Page E848]]

ensures that in terms of having young children eager to read, there&#x27;s 
``More Where That Came From&#x27;&#x27;. I am grateful for Dolly Parton&#x27;s 
Imagination Library and promise to continue doing ``All I Can Do&#x27;&#x27; to 
advance this noble cause--even if it means working past ``9 to 5&#x27;&#x27;. 
After all, there is little else more important than instilling a love 
for reading within the minds of children.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the 
impact and service that Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library will 
continue to have in Missouri&#x27;s Fifth Congressional District and the 
rest of the ``Show-Me&#x27;&#x27; State. I speak with the voice of Missouri&#x27;s 
entire Fifth Congressional District as we say a heartfelt ``thank you&#x27;&#x27; 
to Dolly Parton&#x27;s Imagination Library as we celebrate and congratulate 
them on all their current achievements and those to come.

         RECOGNIZING WILKES-BARRE TOWNSHIP&#x27;S 250TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, today I wish to commemorate the 250th 
anniversary of the Township of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a modern 
metropolitan hub with roots in our Nation&#x27;s Industrial Revolution. I 
have always been proud of the heritage and history of the 8th 
Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which I have the privilege to 
represent, and the story of Wilkes-Barre Township is one I&#x27;m eager to 
share.
  The Township of Wilkes-Barre, founded during America&#x27;s Colonial Era, 
originally extended from the Susquehanna River to the Lehigh River. The 
Native American inhabitants of the region sold to Connecticut settlers 
rolling hills with endless forests, valley-wide vistas, and pristine 
watersheds nestled between these two major waterways.
  Officially incorporated in 1774, Wilkes-Barre Township was named for 
two courageous Englishmen, John Wilkes and Colonel Isaac Barre, who 
supported colonial America and fought for our country&#x27;s independence 
while serving in the British Parliament.
  The Township&#x27;s role in the 19th Century Industrial Boom began in 
1849, when Moses Tammany left the shores of his beloved Ireland for a 
better life that was promised in America. Upon arrival in our region, 
Moses acquired most of the land that is now Wilkes-Barre Township for 
the sum of $12,000. Not long thereafter, the largest anthracite coal 
fields in the United States were discovered nearby, with coal companies 
purchasing up major parcels of Tammany&#x27;s land as it contained the 
finest and purest anthracite coal deposits in the world.
  Between the late 1800&#x27;s and early 1900&#x27;s, hundreds of thousands of 
European immigrants flocked to Wilkes-Barre Township to work in the 
mines, transforming the Wyoming Valley from an isolated farming area to 
a major metropolis and fueling America&#x27;s Industrial Revolution.
  When coal mining waned in the 1930s, the region developed a highly 
diversified manufacturing economy that includes glass, boilers, toys, 
steel fabrications, airplane parts and electronics.
  Today, Wilkes-Barre Township serves as a commercial destination for 
Northeastern Pennsylvania thanks to the addition of the Mohegan Sun 
Arena at Casey Plaza and several major shopping hubs, including the 
Arena Hub Plaza, Wilkes-Barre Township Commons, and the Wilkes-Barre 
Township Marketplace.
  Throughout the past two-and-a-half centuries, the spirit of America 
has truly been portrayed in Wilkes-Barre Township and the heart of 
American history lies within.
  I commend Mayor Carl Kuren and the citizens of Wilkes-Barre Township 
for their commitment and hard work in organizing a grand 
Semiquincentennial Celebration--250 years as a community and a township 
is certainly a cause for celebration.
  I also congratulate Wilkes-Barre Township for withstanding the tests 
of time and for providing a welcoming community for friends, neighbors 
and visitors.
  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I ask all Members 
of the House of Representatives to join me in paying tribute to Wilkes-
Barre Township&#x27;s 250th anniversary and wishing its residents many more 
years of good fortune.

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, with a heavy heart, I commemorate 
the passing of a beloved force in New Mexico, Dr. Miguel Rios, Jr.
  Miguel&#x27;s life was a remarkable journey of dedication and achievement. 
From his early days earning his Ph.D. in Experimental Nuclear Physics 
at the University of Maryland to founding ORION International 
Technologies, Inc. in Albuquerque, Miguel was a pioneer in his field. 
His tenure as president of ORION and his work at Sandia National 
Laboratories

[[Page E847]]

showcased his brilliance and unwavering commitment to advancing 
technology and science.
  In 1985, Miguel&#x27;s expertise and leadership were further recognized 
when he was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to serve as a member 
of the National Science Board for the National Science Foundation. This 
prestigious appointment underscored his significant contributions to 
the scientific community and his influence on national science policy.
  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Miguel&#x27;s leadership at the 
National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) in Santa Fe, where he 
served as Chairman of the Board and Interim President/CEO, was 
transformative. His work in bioinformatics and computational biology 
has left an important mark on the field, contributing to advancements 
that will benefit future generations.
  I was privileged to work alongside Miguel on the National Genome 
Resource Center, where his insights into the role of science in shaping 
New Mexico&#x27;s economy were invaluable. His passion for both science and 
community was truly inspiring, and I learned so much from him.
  Miguel was not only a brilliant scientist and leader but also a 
loving husband, father, and grandfather. His deep love for his wife, 
Maria Estela de Rios, is legendary. I will always remember their smooth 
dancing to the tango, the cumbia, and other mainstays of his Latino 
cultural heritage. His love for his family (familia)--Miguel III, the 
late Benjamin Tomas, Eva Angelica, Magdalena Anastacia--and his 
grandchildren was evident in all he did.
  His family is in my thoughts and prayers. May Miguel&#x27;s spirit 
continue to guide and watch over them. His passing is a profound loss 
not only to his family but also to the scientific community, to our 
civic community, and to all who were fortunate enough to know him.
  Miguel&#x27;s legacy will continue to inspire all who knew him.

        RETHINKING AMERICA&#x27;S NUCLEAR POSTURE: A QUESTION OF WHY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 27, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to address the future of 
our nuclear posture.
  In 1985, Ronald Reagan and Gorbachev, two cold warriors at the head 
of the world&#x27;s largest nuclear arsenals, declared that nuclear war 
cannot be won and must never be fought. That declaration was regularly 
repeated and reaffirmed by the leaders of all five Nuclear Weapon 
States in 2022. This recognition should be the start and end of every 
conversation on nuclear weapons.
  Nevertheless, nuclear powers, since the advent of the Cold War, 
instead seem to have concluded that deterrence requires more nuclear 
weapons of every kind than the adversary. Today, because of this logic, 
we find ourselves engaged in a three-way nuclear arms race with Russia, 
China, and the U.S., each blaming the other for starting it and 
continuing it. Each nation, fearing an adversary may outflank them, 
continues to build nuclear infrastructure: nuclear silos in China&#x27;s 
western deserts, nuclear weapons on satellites, and replacement ICBMs. 
As each nation seeks to strengthen its own hand, on and on it goes . . 
. a constant buildup where a country asks, ``How can we build faster?&#x27;&#x27; 
or ``What can we target&#x27;&#x27; but ignores the most important question: Why?
  Leadership requires the rigorous use of that three-letter word, 
``Why.&#x27;&#x27; We must avoid blind adherence to yesterday&#x27;s decisions. In 
today&#x27;s discussion, that means asking what is sufficient for nuclear 
deterrence. Looking at past strategies and relying on past assumptions 
isn&#x27;t enough. Old cold-war mentalities will create unacceptable costs, 
rob us of alternatives, and place us in even greater danger. Instead, 
we must think boldly and not repeat the problems of our history.
  With this in mind, I bring this question of ``why&#x27;&#x27; to us all.
  I know full well that we face a hostile world with numerous 
aggressive adversaries. We also know that we are now engaged in a 
nuclear arms race with China and Russia. Other nations are also known 
to have nuclear weapons, and others seek them. In this dangerous 
environment, deterrence must consider far more than just a great-power 
nuclear exchange.
  We have also seen the threat to use nuclear weapons to deter non-
nuclear aggression. Putin has used irresponsible nuclear threats to try 
and prevent our support for the Ukrainian people in the defense of 
their country.
  Of course, no one has yet used these weapons, a fact that I know we 
are all grateful for, but with every threat comes the risk of use. No 
matter who has them, the prevalence of nuclear weapons places the world 
at risk. Today, we must think not just in terms of the threat but also 
in terms of the future.
  So, let us ask a foundational question: Why does America need nuclear 
weapons? If it does, how many and what kind? Proponents often justify 
nuclear weapons for two reasons: (1) to deter and fight a strategic 
nuclear exchange between major powers, and (2) to deter non-nuclear 
aggression.
  Focusing on the first category, deterring an opponent from using 
strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, history would indicate that the 
strategy has worked for more than 70 years . . . but that record 
understates how close we came to causing our own destruction. Several 
near-disastrous incidents motivated leaders to back away and undertake 
several treaties to reduce weapons and risks. Leaders like Reagan, JFK, 
Eisenhower, Carter, and Obama knew that nuclear weapons could end 
civilization and, with those heavy moral and ethical considerations in 
mind, negotiated significant safety measures and a serious reduction in 
nuclear weapons.
  These leaders demonstrated vision and commitment. They knew that war 
was not an option, so they had to create a vision for a safer future. 
Unfortunately, too many today shrug their shoulders and say the time 
for negations is not now. Which brings us to yet another question: Why 
not try? Over the next 30 years, we will spend almost 2 trillion 
dollars on our nuclear weapons. What if we spent just 1% on diplomatic 
and risk reduction efforts?
  The second category of limiting non-nuclear aggression carries its 
own risks. Proponents of using nuclear weapons suggest that we could 
use ``tactical weapons&#x27;&#x27; in some limited way. However, once a nuclear 
option starts, when and how does a tactical exchange proceed? In the 
chaos and fog of war, would this tactical nuclear option just open the 
way to full-scale devastation? Many ``think tanks&#x27;&#x27; have studied this, 
and to this day, the result is ``do not open Pandora&#x27;s Box.&#x27;&#x27;
  Despite their limitations, both categories are also how we continue 
to justify our spending on our massive nuclear arsenal. Some even use 
them to justify larger and larger expenses. But this brings us to 
another why question: Why have we chosen to spend our defense dollars 
on modernizing every element in the current nuclear systems?
  This question will become increasingly important as timelines slip 
and costs grow in our nuclear modernization programs. For example, 
fresh off its first Nunn-McCurdy review, the Sentinel Program will now 
cost at least $140 billion, not including a new bomb for another $30 
billion or the unknown costs of plutonium pit production.
  We have an obligation to ask why. Not only `why the extraordinary 
cost increases&#x27;, but far more importantly, why are we doing the 
Sentinel program at all? Is there no alternative that would deter 
adversaries more effectively?
  History is an important guide in this matter. In the 1950s and 1960s, 
our nuclear enterprise developed ground-based ICBMs, and we have 
continued them through the years. Today, members of Congress, without 
scrutiny, repeat a mantra that 400 ground-based ICBMs are necessary. 
But 40 years after the advent of the SSBNs and 20 years after stealth 
bombers, why are these ground-based ICBMs necessary? These missiles sit 
in their silos, not too far from you, in the heart of America, whose 
locations are known to cow hands, sheepherders, and targeting personnel 
in the bunkers of our adversaries.
  If, in a nuclear crisis, adversaries chose to target out missile 
fields, they will launch early

to destroy those missiles whose locations are known. Thus, the MMIII 
and the Sentinel create an extraordinarily dangerous situation. In the 
event of a perceived attack, there would be immense pressure on the 
President to make the decision to launch within minutes or risk losing 
the missiles.
  With all this in mind, why spend such a massive amount of money on a 
system that is so vulnerable and so extraordinarily dangerous? In 
defense policy, nothing should be sacred or untouchable, and everything 
should require frequent re-evaluation. So, let us not be afraid to ask 
yet another question: why a triad? Strategy cannot afford to be 
stagnant. It cannot afford to complacently accept the assumptions of 
the past.
  We must ask why we need the ground leg of the Triad. If the nuclear 
program is for deterrence, is the firepower of the submarines, 
airplanes, and their missiles sufficient to dissuade an adversary? 
These systems have the benefit of stealth, and the President has the 
time to gather all information and then decide whether to use the 
nuclear response. If that were not enough, we also have conventional 
weapons that can deter adversaries.
  But even if we do retain each leg, we must reevaluate what&#x27;s truly 
necessary within each. We do not have infinite resources and must make 
difficult choices about where we allocate our national resources. As we 
rethink whether we can achieve deterrence with different mixes, let&#x27;s 
prioritize safety and effectiveness over fulfilling antiquated 
assumptions or requirements. Remember, this is not just a matter of 
matching our capability to their capability. This is about what will 
ensure our future survival.
  Too often, debates on deterrence do not consider the rapidly changing 
security environment; cyber warfare, uncertainty, confusion, and 
misunderstanding could be greater risks than aggression. We are heavily 
dependent on our space observation and communication systems, and now 
we know that space war is real and routinely discussed. How do we weigh 
those risks when we decide to continue to keep 400 Sentinel or MMIII 
missiles, each prepared to kill millions, on constant alert, ready for 
immediate launch in just a few moments when there will certainly be 
chaos and uncertainty?
  Surely, more destructive capability is not always better. So why do 
we need so many? Considering how many weapons will deter conflict is 
not just a military problem of tit-for-tat calculations. What national 
victory could we, or just as important our adversaries, ever hope to 
achieve at the end of a nuclear war that inevitably kills hundreds of 
millions of people, including tens of millions of Americans, destroys 
entire cities, and endangers the environment of the planet?
  As we think about deterrence in the modern era, it is clear from 
rising costs and the existential dangers that we cannot afford a new 
arms race. Of course, we must grapple with hard questions about how to 
deter dangerous adversaries. Still, we must answer an even harder 
question: how do we deter in a way that ensures there is a tomorrow 
worth protecting? Must we continue a 50-year-old triad strategy without 
considering the alternatives? Why, why are we stuck in a logic silo 
with the blast door closed?
  I want to end this with a discussion I had with the captain of a 
United Kingdom nuclear-armed submarine. After touring his ship, I 
stopped at the foot of the ladder to thank him for the discussion. I 
said ``I appreciate the enormous responsibility and difficult task that 
you have. If you receive a message to launch your missiles, and you do, 
what do you do next? Go home?&#x27;&#x27; I&#x27;ll never forget the look on his face. 
I don&#x27;t know if he had ever contemplated that question, but that&#x27;s a 
question that we must all ask today.
