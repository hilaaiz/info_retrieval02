   HONORING FELLOW MISSISSIPPIAN AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE THOMAS 
                 JEFFERSON FOUNDATION--DANIEL P. JORDAN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL GUEST

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 29, 2024

  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy 
of Mississippi native Dr. Daniel P. Jordan. Dr. Jordan served as the 
executive director and the President of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation 
in Charlottesville overseeing the historical process and interest of 
Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello.
  As a native Mississippian, he was known for his ``Magnolia Alerts&#x27;&#x27; 
which would alert him to any vehicle with a Mississippi license plate. 
David would personally go to the visitor&#x27;s center and welcome his 
fellow Mississippians to Monticello.
  He was known as ``the most consequential president on the Mountaintop 
since Jefferson himself.&#x27;&#x27; He worked hard to raise money for the Thomas 
Jefferson Foundation and to expand the research capabilities at 
Monticello. David made the history of Jefferson accessible to everyday 
Americans through expanding Monticello&#x27;s programing and growing their 
audience.
  Dr. David Jordan was a frequent visitor to the Neshoba County Fair in 
Mississippi, even during his long tenure in Virginia. I&#x27;m thankful for 
Dr. Jordan&#x27;s dedication to the scholarship of history, the years of 
research into Jefferson&#x27;s life, and his unwavering commitment to his 
Mississippi roots.
  I will end with some of David&#x27;s words about President Jefferson. ``We 
have 200 people trying to keep up with one man--one dead man, and we 
will never catch him.&#x27;&#x27; If anyone got close to catching Jefferson, it 
was Dr. Daniel Jordan.

HONORING JAMES COLLINS TAYLOR, VETERAN OF THE GHOST ARMY, FOR RECEIVING 
                      THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. WARREN DAVIDSON

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 29, 2024

  Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, on February 1, 2022, the President signed 
into law S. 1404, which awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd 
Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, known 
as the Ghost Army. The Congressional Gold Medal is the oldest and 
highest civilian award in the United States. I rise today to honor 
Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II for his contributions, 
sacrifices, and patriotism while serving in the Ghost Army during World 
War II. Due to the unit&#x27;s sworn secrecy, their service and 
contributions went unnoticed for far too long.
  Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II was born in Mission, Texas, on 
November 13th, 1915. Mr. Taylor joined the Civilian Conservation Corps. 
After the outbreak of World War II, he was assigned to the 23rd 
Headquarters Special Troops. This specialized unit comprised only 1,100 
brave Americans and often served near the front lines.
  Mr. Taylor helped conduct numerous deceptive campaigns with the Ghost 
Army throughout Europe. During his service, he received a Certificate 
of Merit and was promoted to Sergeant Major of the Army--the highest 
rank possible for an enlisted soldier. While the Ghost Army&#x27;s work was 
secret, its impact was substantial. The Ghost Army performed 22 
``deception missions&#x27;&#x27; across the front lines of France, Belgium, and 
Germany. By simulating the movement of 30,000 service members, the 
Ghost Army fooled German forces and aided General Patton at several 
critical junctures in World War II.
  It is my honor to recognize the service Sergeant Major James C. 
Taylor and the Ghost Army. Their dedication and service saved thousands 
of American lives. Although the Congressional Gold Medal reaches Mr. 
Taylor posthumously, he is survived by a grateful family and country.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MARC A. VEASEY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 29, 2024

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and 
accomplishments of Mr. Anthony DeWayne Baker, Sr.--a pillar of our 
Dallas community.
  Mr. Baker was a graduate of David W. Carter High School in Dallas, 
Texas before rising through the ranks of Airbus helicopters. Anthony 
then went back to school, graduating from Dallas Baptist University 
with a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Business in 2005. Anthony&#x27;s first job was 
employment at Walls Services delivering sheet rock and in 1991 his 
career in the aerospace industry began when he landed a job working in 
the Bond shop at Vought Aircraft, formerly known as LTV. However, after 
3 years with his newfound skills he accepted a temporary position as a 
blade repairman at American Eurocopter (Airbus), and due to his hard 
work and determined mindset he was later offered a permanent position. 
Mr. Baker eventually capped off his illustrious career as Vice 
President for Customer Support at Airbus Helicopters, the first 
African-American to hold the position.
  Throughout his lifetime he overcame many barriers both personally and 
professionally, while always looking for ways to help others. He was a 
man of faith who proudly served our community for many years in his 
capacity as a Deacon, a member of the Cedar Hill Volunteer Fire 
Brigade; he was the current President of Summit at Lake Ridge HOA; he 
served on the UTA Engineering Board of Advisors; a member of the Grand 
Prairie United Charities Board of Directors, and was involved in 
countless other charitable endeavors.
  My thoughts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved 
Anthony, particularly his wife, Stacie, and his two children, Anthony 
DeWayne Baker, Jr. and Avery Alexander Baker. May his memory last 
forever.

      HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LAWRENCE ``LARRY&#x27;&#x27; AMENDOLA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 29, 2024

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I use today 
to pay tribute to the life and legacy of an outstanding member of the 
New Haven community and my dear friend, Lawrence Amendola. Larry was an 
extraordinary man who dedicated a lifetime of service to the City of 
New Haven, particularly the Wooster Square neighborhood we both called 
home.
  Born and raised in New Haven, Connecticut, Larry enlisted in the 
United States Army after graduating from high school. Stationed in 
Germany for the majority of his military service, he was honorably 
discharged before returning to New Haven to begin his career. Larry 
spent his professional life as a civil servant, beginning his City 
employment at the CETA Program and later working for the Department of 
Parks and Recreation, retiring at the age of 75.
  Larry also served as President of AFSCME Local 3144 Management Union, 
one of City&#x27;s largest unions, for over 20 years. It was in this role 
that he had the most impact--where he fought on behalf of hundreds of 
city employees, negotiating contracts that ensured good wages and 
health benefits as well as pension and retirement security. Larry 
understood better than most the benefits of the union and he worked 
tirelessly on behalf of those he represented.
  While Larry dedicated his professional life to the City of New Haven, 
he also dedicated much of his time and energy to the community as well. 
He served as Vice-President and President of the Saint Andrew the 
Apostle Society--one of the Italian American social organizations whose 
goal is to preserve and celebrate our shared Italian heritage. Larry 
served in these roles for more than 30 years and volunteered countless 
hours at the Society&#x27;s annual festival. His work in the community was 
recognized when he was awarded the Steve Vuolo Award.
  I am fortunate in that I knew Larry for most of my life. He was a 
close family friend, having worked with both of my parents over the 
years. I had the opportunity to work with Larry early in my career. I 
was working with the Community Action Institute--at the Skill Center on 
Cedar Street--and Larry and I partnered to organize additional city 
employees. He was not only a friend, but a great mentor. I learned a 
lot from him and was always grateful for his support and friendship 
throughout my own career.
  Lawrence ``Larry&#x27;&#x27; Amendola was a remarkable member of our community. 
His passing leaves a hole in our community that will not easily be 
filled. I extend my deepest sympathies to his companion of nearly 20 
years, Flora D&#x27;Elsi, as well as his many cherished nieces, nephews, 
great and great-great nieces and nephews. His passion, advocacy, and 
commitment to service will long serve as an example to which we should 
all strive.

                         Monday, April 29, 2024

  Ms. BUDZINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Workers 
Memorial Day 2024 and the workers who have both lost their lives or 
risk their lives in unsafe working conditions on a daily basis. Too 
many people across the country, even today in 2024, are still forced to 
choose between a paycheck and having a safe and healthy workplace. This 
is unacceptable, and on Workers Memorial Day we remember all the 
workers who have been injured or have lost their lives on the job.
  As a Member of Congress, I am dedicated to working to ensure that 
Congress and the

[[Page E404]]

federal government both strengthen protections for workers in the 
workplace and defend the rights of workers to organize and create 
strong unions. For this reason, I am proud to be an original cosponsor 
of the PRO Act and will continue to work with my colleagues in 
Washington to push Congress to take up and pass pro-worker legislation.
  As someone who got their start in the labor movement, I will never 
stop advocating on behalf of the working men and women who serve as the 
backbone of this country. On this Workers Memorial Day, I am proud to 
take this opportunity to honor them and the sacrifices they have made 
over the years to fight for their right to be treated with dignity.

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor George W. 
Waddles, Jr., on the occasion of his 10 years of service to the Second 
Baptist Church of Ypsilanti, Michigan. His significant service to his 
congregation and community is worthy of commendation.
  Pastor Waddles received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Truman 
State University, a Master of Theology with a concentration in Pastoral 
Leadership from Dallas Theological Seminary, and a Master of 
Educational Administration from Texas A&amp;M. In 1984, he was licensed to 
preach at the Ninth Street Baptist Church in Lawrence, Kansas and was 
also ordained at Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church on December 1, 
1995. After serving Sunset Missionary Baptist Church of Texarkana in 
Texas for over ten years, Pastor Waddles began his service as Pastor of 
the Second Baptist Church in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in March 2014. Under 
his leadership, the Second Baptist Church has become a pillar of 
Ypsilanti, and continues its important mission of serving the 
community.
  Pastor Waddles has led by example and embodies the mission of the 
church: Connection, Commitment, and Community. During his decade of 
service, Pastor Waddles has been deeply involved with ministry teams to 
better serve his community, and the church continues to make a positive 
impact by promoting the Making Strides Cancer Walk, participating in 
the Ypsilanti 4th of July Parade, and collecting backpacks and school 
supplies to help students. Pastor Waddles has also been a lecturer and 
instructor in the National Baptist Congress of Christian Education and 
the Wolverine State Convention and Huron Valley District Association. 
He has served as Dean, and currently is the President of the Huron 
Valley District Congress of Christian Education. Across all these 
roles, Pastor Waddle has remained committed to serving his community 
and uplifting all those within it.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Pastor 
Waddles for his decade of public service in Ypsilanti. His commitment 
to his faith, community, and mission is truly inspiring. I join Pastor 
Waddle&#x27;s family, friends, and congregation in extending my best wishes 
to him during this time, and I am sure he will continue to serve his 
community far into the future.

1986, Mr. Brown moved to Sherman with his family to become Cola-Cola&#x27;s 
Sales Center Manager, a position he held for over 24 years. During this 
time, Mr. Brown&#x27;s longtime support of the Sherman business community, 
as well as his many years of community involvement, did not go 
unnoticed. After he briefly retired in 2010, he was selected the 
following year by members of the Sherman Chamber to serve as its 
Interim President. In 2012, Mr. Brown became its President and Chief 
Executive Officer. Through various initiatives and visionary 
leadership, he laid the foundation for the Sherman business community&#x27;s 
tremendous growth and economic success.

on the board of the Texas Chamber of Commerce Executives to advocate 
for the business community and unite business leaders across North 
Texas. He was also a board member of the Boys and Girls Club of Sherman 
and the Sherman ISD Education Foundation. Moreover, Mr. Brown led 
efforts to connect Grayson College and the Texas Association of 
Business to ensure it received newly enacted education funding. In his 
free time, he enjoys golfing, traveling, and the outdoors. I am proud 
of the work Mr. Brown has accomplished for our business and education 
community.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol to honor Mr. Brown&#x27;s lifetime of service to the people of North 
Texas. May God Bless him.

THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REVITALIZATION AND SELF-GOVERNMENT IMPROVEMENT ACT 
               OF 1977 TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, April 29, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the National Capital 
Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 Technical 
Corrections Act of 2024, which would address several retirement issues 
for current and former District of Columbia employees that resulted 
from the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government 
Improvement Act of 1997 (Revitalization Act). The Revitalization Act, 
among other things, transferred several categories of employees who 
were in the D.C. retirement system to the federal retirement system and 
the federal government took over paying for the pension benefits earned 
by teachers, police officers, firefighters, and judges before 1997.
  The Revitalization Act transferred several categories of employees, 
primarily related to D.C.&#x27;s criminal justice system, who participated 
in D.C.&#x27;s defined contribution plan from 1987 to 1997 to the Federal 
Employees Retirement System (FERS). However, these employees&#x27; service 
from 1987 to 1997 was not counted for purposes of creditable service or 
annuity amount in FERS. In 2009, Congress passed legislation counting 
this service for creditable service, but not annuity amount. This bill 
would allow these employees to buy into the FERS annuity amount for 
1987 to 1997 by paying 1.3 percent of their base pay plus interest, 
essentially the employee contribution for this time, which would give 
them the full retirement benefit to which they should be entitled.
  Second, this bill would address two benefit issues for employees in 
the teachers, police officers, and firefighters pension plans, whose 
pre-1997 benefits are funded by the federal government. In 2018, D.C. 
enacted a law to provide domestic partner benefits for the police and 
firefighters pension plan, which mirrored a law already enacted for 
teachers. However, these domestic partner benefits apply only to 
service accrued after 1997, since the federal government funds pre-1997 
benefits. This bill would make the domestic partner benefits available 
for pre-1997 benefits, too.
  Finally, in 2012, D.C. enacted the Equity in Survivor Benefits 
Amendment Act, which reduced from age 60 to 55 the age after which a 
surviving spouse may remarry without losing survivor benefits for those 
in the teachers, police, and firefighters pension plans. However, these 
survivor benefits apply only to service accrued after 1997, since the 
federal government funds pre-1997 benefits. This bill would bring those 
pre-1997 benefits in line with both the post-1997 benefits and the 
retirement benefits for federal employees in the Civil Service 
Retirement System or FERS and make an analogous change for D.C. judges, 
whose retirement benefits are funded by the federal government. In 
general, for federal retirees, 55 is the age after which a surviving 
spouse may remarry without losing survivor benefits.
  This bill is an important step to assist these workers in getting the 
retirement benefits they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.
