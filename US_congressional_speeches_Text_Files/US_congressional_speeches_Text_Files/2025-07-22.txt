        CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF STEPHANIE PAPAGIANNIS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MARLIN A. STUTZMAN

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. STUTZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
American who has resided for over 70 years in Indiana&#x27;s 3rd District, 
Mrs. Stephanie Papagiannis, as she celebrates her 100th birthday on 
July 25, 2025. a century marked by perseverance, family, faith, and an 
enduring love for this country.
  Born in 1925 in the village of Vishini now known as Vissinia. 
Stephanie grew up amid the political and cultural upheaval of Greek-
occupied Macedonia. She witnessed firsthand the efforts to erase the 
language and customs of the native Macedonian people, yet she never 
lost her sense of identity or resilience.
  In 1952, with incredible courage and hope, Stephanie left behind a 
war-torn Europe and emigrated to the United States with her young son, 
James, to reunite with her husband Peter in Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
Together, they built a new life grounded in hard work, community, and 
opportunity. The couple raised three children, and today, their family 
has grown including five grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.
  Stephanie and Peter contributed meaningfully to the local community, 
opening two highly regarded establishments; the Pontiac Rib Bar and 
Pete&#x27;s Gateview Inn. Their restaurants were not just businesses they 
were gathering places that embodied their warmth and entrepreneurial 
spirit.
  A proud member of Fort Wayne&#x27;s Macedonian American community, 
Stephanie maintained strong ties to her heritage and faith through St. 
Nicholas Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral, founded by her relatives. Her 
life has served as a bridge between generations and is inspiring to 
all.
  Mr. Speaker, as Mrs. Papagiannis celebrates her centennial surrounded 
by loved ones, we pay tribute to a remarkable woman whose story 
represents the very best of the American immigrant experience who lived 
the American dream. May her legacy continue to inspire, and may her 
next chapter be filled with joy and peace.

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
extraordinary life and profound contributions of Athens Weed, a 
distinguished veteran, dedicated professional, and tireless community 
activist. As he marks his birthday on July 24, 1952, we take this 
moment to honor his remarkable journey and enduring legacy.
  Born in Chicago, Athens Weed emerged from working class family roots, 
shaped by the strong values instilled by his parents, including his 
stepfather. Taylor Pouncey, who notably served as an Illinois House 
Representative. These early influences laid the foundation for a life 
dedicated to service and achievement.
  Athens pursued higher education, attending both the Illinois 
Institute of Technology (IIT) and Purdue University Calumet, before 
earning an Associate of Science degree from Olive Harvey College. His 
commitment to excellence and duty led him to serve our Nation with 
honor in the United States Navy, a pivotal experience in his life. A 
particularly proud moment in his distinguished military career was 
receiving his Dolphins Medal, qualifying him for Submarine 
Certification--a testament to his exceptional skill and dedication.
  Following his commendable military service, Athens continued to 
contribute significantly to his community and Nation. He became a 
valued member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 
(IBEW) Local 134, showcasing his expertise and commitment to his craft. 
For many years, he also served the public through his employment with 
the Chicago Transit Authority, ensuring essential services for 
countless citizens. Throughout his professional endeavors, Athens Weed 
consistently demonstrates his core values; always working to his 
strengths, ensuring the job gets done with precision, treating everyone 
with respect, and extending a helping hand to those who need it most.
  Beyond his professional achievements, Athens Weed is a deeply engaged 
civic leader. He is a dedicated activist with Operation Breadbasket and 
Operation Rainbow PUSH, embodying the spirit of advocacy and community 
upliftment. His long-standing years of choir service further highlight 
his commitment to communal harmony and spiritual well-being.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the 
exceptional life and ongoing accomplishments of Athens Weed, a true 
American patriot, a compassionate leader, and an inspiring individual 
whose dedication continues to enrich our Nation.

                          HONORING ED FEULNER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, with the passing of Ed 
Feulner, he has been appropriately eulogized for his steadfast 
promotion of modern conservatism. As a Reaganaut serving in the 
Department of Energy, 1981 to 1982, with Secretary Jim Edwards, I know 
firsthand ``The Mandate&#x27;&#x27; was instrumental in promoting free markets. 
The following is from the National Review on July 20th editorialized:

       ``In 1973 Ed Feulner and his friend Paul Weyrich co-founded 
     the Heritage Foundation, the think tank that nurtured and 
     spread many of the policies that informed the Reagan 
     Administration. Its ``Mandate for Leadership&#x27;&#x27; policy 
     compendium in 1980 became a guide for the Reaganauts out to 
     change Washington.
       ``Under Feulner, the think tank also became known for 
     short, fast policy summaries delivered to Members of Congress 
     and staff in anticipation of votes. Turnover on Capitol Hill 
     is rapid, and Heritage&#x27;s missives were influential guides to 
     policies developed on the right over many years.
       ``Like many Reagan-era conservatives, Feulner believed in a 
     coalition built on the three-legged stool of free markets and 
     a smaller government, strong national defense, and 
     traditional views on social policy. He welcomed all factions 
     of what was once called the ``conservative movement,&#x27;&#x27; from 
     libertarians to Russell Kirk traditionalists to neocons.
       ``For many years, the Journal worked with Heritage on the 
     annual Index of Economic Freedom. The volume ranked countries 
     around the world on various measures of economic liberty. 
     Feulner was notable for believing in a strong U.S. presence 
     in the world, and he was especially close to leaders in 
     Taiwan and South Korea. As recently as the mid-2000s we can 
     recall a delegation of Heritage scholars making the case to 
     us that U.S. defense spending should be 5% of gross domestic 
     product. Today it&#x27;s closer to 3%, and heading lower under 
     President Trump.
       ``Born outside Chicago in a German-American Catholic 
     family, Feulner attended Regis College in Denver where he 
     discovered conservative ideas. Barry Goldwater was an early 
     political influence. ``You have to choose between liberty and 
     equality,&#x27;&#x27; Feulner told John Miller of National Review. ``I 
     picked liberty.&#x27;&#x27; Each year he published an essay by thinkers 
     who defined conservative principles.
       ``Feulner was Heritage president for 37 years and remained 
     a trustee in retirement. The think tank has taken a sharp 
     turn toward Trumpian populism in recent years. It opposes 
     free trade and leans toward an isolationist foreign policy. 
     It focuses less on ideas and more on supporting whatever 
     President Trump does. Feulner wasn&#x27;t always happy with 
     Heritage&#x27;s new direction, but he kept his misgivings private 
     out of loyalty to the institution.
       ``As the years advance, it&#x27;s clear that the late 1970s 
     through the 1980s and 1990s was a unique period of 
     conservative intellectual ambition. Ed Feulner&#x27;s motto was 
     ``onward, always,&#x27;&#x27; reflecting his optimism about the 
     durability of America&#x27;s founding ideals. The young 
     Republicans in Washington may not know it, but they are 
     spending down the intellectual capital stockpiled by Ed 
     Feulner and his generation.&#x27;&#x27;

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. SAM T. LICCARDO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. LICCARDO. Mr. Speaker, I rise, along with my colleague Kevin 
Mullin, to recognize and honor Kenneth Paul Kiraly, a distinguished 
innovator, for his dedication to advancing technology and making it 
accessible for everyone. Living all across the San Francisco Bay Area, 
Ken developed a love for designing and building electronics, 
accumulating a multitude of electronic projects throughout his life. 
After graduating high school in Walnut Creek, he went on to attend 
California State University, Pomona, before returning to the Bay Area 
to complete his degree in Computer Science at California State 
University, East Bay.
  As the internet was only beginning to enter our lives, Ken helped 
pioneer development tools for the Java programming language, ultimately 
launching the first full-featured integrated development environments 
(IDEs) for Java. Ken joined Palm as a senior software architect, 
leading the development and delivery of technologies across a variety 
of handheld devices. In 2005, Ken became one of Amazon&#x27;s primary 
leaders in its new consumer device division. His leadership in the 
division enabled the seamless experience of the Kindle--launched in 
2007--transforming the small device into a portable library for 
readers. Ken was particularly focused and proud of one aspect of the 
Kindle: its intuitive system. He cared deeply about making it 
accessible for people who simply loved to read, as well as individuals 
with disabilities. Upon its launch, the Kindle made it possible to 
enlarge the print of books with a single button, allowing individuals 
to rediscover the joy of reading without having to physically hold a 
book. He continued his work at Amazon, most recently developing 
Amazon&#x27;s first consumer robot, Astro--a project blending AI with 
cutting-edge hardware.
  Throughout his accomplished 40-year career, Ken has embodied the 
qualities of an innovator, a bold risk-taker, and a dedicated problem 
solver. As one of the early Distinguished Engineers in Amazon, he not 
only led engineering and product teams, but also mentored and helped 
grow a multitude of engineers and leaders in the company. Furthermore, 
he is named inventor on 44 U.S. patents, across a variety of products. 
All while developing groundbreaking technology, Ken helped raise two 
sons--Paul and James--with his wife, Virginia. As Ken concludes a 
distinguished career, he looks forward to spending more time with his 
family and enjoying the next chapter of his life.

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
extraordinary life and profound contributions of Sasha Daltonn, a 
distinguished founder, producer, and tireless advocate for arts and 
history. As she marks her birthday on June 25, 1950, we take this 
moment to honor her remarkable journey and enduring legacy.
  Born in Chicago, Sasha Daltonn was raised in a household that 
instilled the values of hard work and community. Her mother, Christine, 
contributed through her work in sales, while her father, Edgar, served 
as a proud Pullman porter. These foundations undoubtedly shaped Sasha&#x27;s 
commitment to excellence and service.
  Sasha Daltonn&#x27;s career is marked by her significant roles as both a 
founder and a producer, leaving an indelible mark on various cultural 
landscapes. Her dedication to the arts is evident through her long-
standing affiliations, including a decade with Gospel Music According 
to Chicago (GMACC), two years with Jazz n&#x27; You, nine years with the 
Harold Washington Legacy Committee, and eight years with the South Side 
Jazz Coalition. She is also a proud member of Rainbow PUSH, 
demonstrating her commitment to broader social justice initiatives. 
Currently, Sasha brings her passion and expertise to the airwaves as 
the host of Sasha Daltonn Gospel on Omni Radio, and leads her own 
enterprise as President of Sasha Daltonn Entertainment.
  Her profound contributions have garnered well-deserved recognition 
from numerous esteemed bodies, including honors from the Advinity 
Awards, the AARC Awards, the Harlem Theater Association, and the Fred 
Hammond Awards, among others. These accolades underscore her 
significant impact and the high esteem in which she is held by her 
peers.
  Sasha Daltonn is guided by her faith and an unrelenting commitment to 
instill pride in our youth through the transformative power of the 
arts. She is a fervent champion for preserving Black history and 
honoring the historians and history-makers who have shaped our past and 
continue to inspire our future. Her life&#x27;s work is a testament to 
celebrating and honoring those who paved the way.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the 
exceptional life and ongoing accomplishments of Sasha Daltonn, a true 
cultural pioneer, an inspiring producer, and a dedicated historian 
whose immense contributions continue to enrich our Nation.

   HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF WINDERMERE, FLORIDA

                                 ______

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
Centennial of the Town of Windermere, Florida.
  Originally established as a residential development in 1889 and 
formally chartered in 1925, Windermere&#x27;s history is both rich and 
unique. Its first post office opened in 1888, briefly closed in 1901, 
and reopened in 1911, signaling the resilience of a growing town. The 
Florida Midland Railroad once ran just west of Main Street, where a 
bustling station once stood. Today, a grassy expanse marks that 
historic path, serving as a quiet tribute to Windemere&#x27;s early days.
  Nestled on a scenic isthmus between Lake Butler, Lake Down, and Lake 
Bessie. Windermere is a tranquil gem ``Among the Lakes&#x27;&#x27; in the heart 
of Central Florida. With just over 3,000 residents within its two-
square-mile boundary, it has maintained a distinct small-town charm 
defined by tree-lined street, historic architecture, and a vibrant, 
close-knit community. Just minutes from world-class attractions like 
Walt Disney World and downtown Orlando. Windermere remains a quiet 
sanctuary rooted in history and guided by a shared commitment to 
quality of life.
  The town owes much to the visionaries who helped incorporate it 100 
years ago, including Cal Palmer, J. Howard Johnson, Howard Lyon, and 
Stanley Scott. Their legacy lives on in Windermere&#x27;s thoughtful 
planning and strong community values.
  Over the past century, Windermere has grown while steadfastly 
preserving its natural beauty and heritage. Today, it offers an 
exceptional blend of peaceful living and refined elegance. Beloved 
local traditions, such as the weekly Friday Farmers Market and popular 
Food Truck Nights, bring neighbors together and highlight the town&#x27;s 
enduring community spirit.
  As part of its centennial celebration, the town has unveiled a 
special Centennial Lobby in the Town Administration Building, where 
residents and visitors alike can reflect on the milestones that have 
shaped Windermere over the past 100 years.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate the Town of Windermere on 
this historic occasion and to recognize its significant contributions 
to the fabric of Central Florida. Here&#x27;s to the next 100 years of 
community, character, and continued excellence.

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. WHITESIDES. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise 
today to honor the life of my dear friend, Chad Kampbell. Chad wasn&#x27;t 
just a devoted father, a husband, and an admired community leader--he 
was a cornerstone of the Santa Clarita Valley.
  He and his wife Michelle, who have been close friends for several 
years, were deeply involved in our community.
  Chad was a former president of the Democratic Alliance for Action of 
Santa Clarita Valley, an active member of the Santa Clarita Valley 
Democrats, and someone whose commitment to service ran deep.
  One of his friends described him perfectly: ``He was someone who 
truly grounded those around him. The kind of person who would help you 
cut through the noise, find your center, and remember why you do the 
work in the

[[Page E708]]

first place.&#x27;&#x27; That was Chad. A source of wisdom and calm, always there 
when you needed him.
  He lived in Stevenson Ranch with his wife Michelle and their daughter 
Brigette. And while no words can ease the pain of this loss, I hope his 
family knows just how deeply loved and appreciated Chad was by all of 
us.
  Chad was the kind of guy who would get there early to help set up an 
event, and then he would be breaking down the tables and chairs 
afterwards.
  He was a talented designer and photographer. He knew how to 
communicate, and he used that skill for the benefit of businesses and 
causes close to his heart.
  Chad was known for his booming voice. For many new activists getting 
involved, their introduction to civic engagement was seeing Chad kick-
off a meeting or rally before taking the time to greet them and every 
person there, always with a big smile and an infectious laugh. He 
embodied the truth, that the greatest title of responsibility in any 
democracy is that of citizen.
  Chad was a rock of principle. He was committed to making his 
community, his state and his country better. And month after month, 
year after year, he did the work. He and Michelle profoundly changed 
the Santa Clarita Valley for the better, and his impact will never be 
forgotten.
  Chad gave so much of himself to this community because he believed in 
people and in the power of showing up. His absence leaves a real void, 
but his spirit lives on in the work he championed and the friendships 
he built. May we honor him not just in words, but in how we carry 
ourselves--with compassion, humility, and a commitment to something 
greater than ourselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to close by thanking my summer interns. You 
cannot help but be inspired by our future, if you spend some time with 
the many great interns who work on Capitol Hill.
  They work hard, they do important work interacting with constituents, 
and their passion and inspiration must be recognized.
  I&#x27;m grateful to our team and I wish them the very best for their 
futures.

  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, it is with heavy heart and solemn 
remembrance that I rise to pay tribute to a great woman and dear friend 
and neighbor, Mrs. Christa Sullivan of South San Francisco, California. 
Christa passed away peacefully on Wednesday, July 2, 2025 and her

a beloved mother and is survived by her children Stephanie, Kevin 
(along with his wife Orla), and Christian (along with his wife Karen), 
and her grandchildren Mick, Leah, Casey, Caeli, and Patrick. She was a 
lover of animals, and a longtime volunteer at St. Veronica&#x27;s Parish, 
Mercy High School and Serra High School. She was a steadfast supporter 
of the men and women of the South San Francisco Police Department and 
the founder and lifelong advocate for their association.
  Christa will be remembered for her warmth, quiet strength, and 
unwavering faith. She lived a life rooted in service to her community 
and family, for which we will be forever grateful. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to join me and the residents of California&#x27;s Fifteenth 
Congressional District in rising to recognize a life well lived, and to 
extend our deepest sympathies to Christa&#x27;s family, friends, and loved 
ones during this difficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and 
comforted in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

   RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF FRUITLAND PARK, 
                                FLORIDA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANIEL WEBSTER

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and 
celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the City of Fruitland Park, Florida. 
Known fondly as ``The Friendly City&#x27;&#x27;, Fruitland Park is a historic and 
thriving community in Lake County, Florida.
  On December 14, 1925, residents of the area gathered at the Casino 
building in Fruitland Park for the purpose of organizing a municipal 
government. With a shared vision for the future, the citizens voted to 
incorporate their town and officially adopted the name Fruitland Park. 
Less than two years later, in May of 1927, the city was formally 
chartered.
  In 1925, Fruitland Park was home to just 417 residents, spread across 
a modest 3-square-mile area. As of May 2025, the city has grown to 
serve a population of roughly 9,015 across more than 7 square miles.
  Today, Fruitland Park provides a full range of municipal services, 
including public safety through police and fire departments, essential 
infrastructure support via a robust public works department, access to 
clean water and sanitation utilities, and vibrant recreational and 
library services. These offerings reflect the city&#x27;s deep commitment to 
enhancing quality of life for its residents.
  Fruitland Park&#x27;s natural beauty, small-town charm, and strong civic 
infrastructure make it a desirable location for retirees and families 
alike. Its development in recent years has been extraordinary, and its 
future continues to look bright with anticipated progress over the 
coming decade.
  It is my privilege to honor and celebrate the City of Fruitland Park 
on the occasion of its centennial anniversary. May the next 100 years 
be as vibrant and prosperous as the first.

          RECOGNIZING THE 22ND ANNUAL DISABILITY PRIDE PARADE

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 22nd 
Annual Disability Pride Parade taking place in Chicago&#x27;s Loop on 
Saturday, July 26. The parade takes place 35 years to the day that the 
Americans with Disability Act (ADA) was signed into law, and the theme 
of the parade is 35 years of ADA: Still Rising, Still Thriving.
  The mission of the Disability Pride Parade is to change the way 
people think about and define ``disability,&#x27;&#x27; to break down and end the 
internalized shame among people with disabilities, and to promote the 
belief in society that disability is a natural and beautiful part of 
human diversity in which people living with disabilities can take 
pride.
  In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law. 
This bipartisan effort made a commitment that our history of 
segregating and isolating persons with disabilities would end. In the 
law&#x27;s own words, the purpose of the ADA is to ``provide a clear and 
comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination 
against individuals with disabilities.&#x27;&#x27;
  By setting enforceable standards, providing assistance for 
compliance, and asserting the federal government&#x27;s central role in 
ending discrimination, this landmark civil rights law has provided hope 
and opportunity for all Americans--those today living with a disability 
and those of us who could become disabled tomorrow. Because of the ADA, 
individuals with disabilities have the legal right to fully participate 
in our society--the right to transportation, health services, shopping, 
entertainment, education, employment, public accommodations, and 
voting.
  Those who fought so hard to win its passage--including my friend and 
mentor Marca Bristo, the founder and head of Access Living--deserve to 
celebrate its enactment and deserve our thanks. But as we celebrate 
today, we have to get to work tomorrow. We need to build on the ADA&#x27;s 
promise--whether it is passing my bill, the Eleanor Smith Inclusive 
Home Design Act, to make sure that all new residential housing built 
with federal dollars is accessible or increasing the employment of 
adults with disabilities.
  This year, we have seen a number of legislative attempts to take away 
rights from disabled individuals. The Big Ugly Bill, which Republicans 
passed through Congress, is going to strip health care away from nearly 
17 million individuals, including many with disabilities. I stood on 
the frontlines with disability advocates who have truly been the tip of 
the spear in the fight to protect all Americans&#x27; health care. While we 
did not win this battle, the fight is not over. The power of the people 
is always greater than that of the people in power.
  As long as discrimination still exists and as long as there are those 
who seek to undermine existing law, the purpose of the ADA will not 
have been completely met. It is our job to make sure that happens.

              RECOGNIZING THE NAVY CLUB OF GEORGETOWN, SC

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. RUSSELL FRY

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. FRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Navy Club of 
Georgetown, South Carolina, as it celebrates an extraordinary 
milestone, its 100th anniversary. Since 1925, this group has united 
veterans of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. From the shores of 
South Carolina to all around the world, they&#x27;ve served our Nation with 
honor.
  For generations, the Navy Club has remained deeply embedded in the 
life of the Georgetown community--supporting Navy Junior Reserve 
Officers, honoring naval heritage, and fostering a spirit of unity 
among veterans and civilians alike.
  What began in 1925, as a gathering of like-minded servicemembers, has 
grown into a lasting institution, one that continues to support 
generations of veterans through friendship, mentorship, and tradition. 
The Club&#x27;s annual shrimp dinners have become a beloved local occasion, 
bringing people together to share stories, remember the past, and 
strengthen community ties.
  The Navy Club&#x27;s mission is clear: to honor the proud legacy of naval 
service in South Carolina. Through veteran outreach, youth engagement, 
and the preservation of time-honored customs, it safeguards our 
maritime traditions for the future.
  As we mark this centennial, we are reminded of the enduring values 
that define our armed forces: honor, courage, and commitment. The Navy 
Club&#x27;s story is one of lasting impact, civic pride, and a devotion to 
service that transcends generations.
  Over the decades, it has built a strong foundation of fellowship and 
support, uplifting those who served, commemorating those we&#x27;ve lost, 
and building bridges within Georgetown. Its events have become more 
than social gatherings--they are touchpoints of history, community, and 
service.
  Their passion for service, fellowship, and patriotism continues to 
inspire the next generation. On behalf of the people of South 
Carolina&#x27;s Seventh District, I thank them and congratulate them on 100 
years.

                 REMEMBERING JOSEPH H. ``JOE&#x27;&#x27; CAMPBELL

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy 
of Joseph H. ``Joe&#x27;&#x27; Campbell, a respected farmer and pioneer in 
California&#x27;s table grape industry, who passed away on July 10, 2025, at 
the age of 81.
  Joe Campbell was part of a generation that helped shape the modern 
agricultural landscape of the Central Valley. After graduating from 
Delano High School in 1960 and serving in the U.S. Army, Joe began 
farming in 1969. He first grew cotton and wheat, then later moved into 
almonds and, ultimately, table grapes. In 1986, he leased his first 
vineyard, setting the course for what would become a transformative 
career in California agriculture.
  Through his leadership roles at Delano Farms and Four Star Fruit, Joe 
helped grow the combined operation into one of the largest table grape 
producers in the state. His business decisions often required risk, but 
they were grounded in instinct, common sense, and a deep familiarity 
with the communities in which he operated. He played a defining role in 
shaping California&#x27;s table grape industry--a legacy that endures.
  While Joe&#x27;s work ethic and vision helped drive the success of a major 
agricultural enterprise, he remained grounded in his roots and true to 
the values that shaped him. He was known for his humility, consistency, 
and dedication to his family above all else. He shared a long and 
loving marriage with his wife, Jana, and raised three sons who continue 
his legacy in agriculture.
  Joe Campbell&#x27;s story is a reminder of the strength and promise of 
California&#x27;s farming families. His contributions helped define an 
industry, and his example will continue to influence the generations 
that follow.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Joseph H. 
Campbell. He was a farmer, a businessman, and a man whose life&#x27;s work 
and pursuit of the American dream left a lasting mark on the Central 
Valley and California agriculture.

                             RIP ED FEULNER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 22, 2025

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, supporters of freedom 
universally appreciate the success of the late Ed Feulner. The Unleash 
Prosperity Hotline of Stephen Moore gives a heartfelt tribute of RIP Ed 
Feulner:

       ``Ed Feulner was a free-market conservative and fierce 
     anti-communist back in the 1970s, long before it was cool. He 
     invented the modern-day think tank, taking it from the days 
     of stodgy 200-page tomes that lay gathering dust on 
     bookshelves and read by few, to providing just-in-time, 
     influential, hard-hitting studies delivered into the hands of 
     the policymakers that mattered.
       ``Among his many contributions to advancing freedom and 
     free enterprise was to train hundreds of today&#x27;s leading 
     voices in the conservative movement--including some of the 
     thinkers and activists at Unleash Prosperity. Heritage taught 
     young talent how to be relevant and impactful--something our 
     billion-dollar universities don&#x27;t do.
       ``He believed that ``people are policy&#x27;&#x27; and that&#x27;s a 
     lesson that this so-far successful Trump administration has 
     taken to heart. His legacy lives on.&#x27;&#x27;
