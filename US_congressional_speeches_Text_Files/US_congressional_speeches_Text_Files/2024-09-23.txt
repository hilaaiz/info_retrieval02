                      APPRECIATING PHILLIP TRULUCK

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 23, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 
anniversary of the passing of the Florence-born Phillip Truluck on 
October 6, 2022, I am grateful for his contributions to Congress while 
at the House Republican Study Committee and during his long tenure as 
the valued leader of the Heritage Foundation. He is missed.
  The following obituary was published upon his death:

       A son of South Carolina, Phil was born in Florence, South 
     Carolina, on June 18, 1947 and passed away October 6, 2022. 
     He spent his childhood and teenage years in Lake City, where 
     he attended public schools. His beloved mother, Ethel Mason 
     Truluck, taught him American History and famously refused to 
     grant him the well-deserved annual history award for fear of 
     appearing partial. He later went on to earn a B.S. in Finance 
     at the University of South Carolina. His leadership skills 
     were recognized early and he was elected President of Chi Psi 
     fraternity.
       Perhaps to make up for the history award, his mother 
     arranged for Phil to go to Washington and work for then 
     Senator Strom Thurmond--as a driver and envelope stuffer. 
     Cream rose to the top and he went on to work in several 
     congressional offices, as Deputy Director of the House 
     Republican Study Committee and, for over 38 years, as a 
     leader of the Heritage Foundation.
       Along the way, he met, courted and married Ann Wrobleski on 
     January 6, 1979. Mason Martha was born ten years later, 
     followed by twins, Walker Edward and Sutton

     Arthur. Phil liked to say he went from man to man to zone 
     defense in 30 months.
       Phil was a born developer--of people and real estate. As 
     Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Phil 
     managed the day-to-day running of Heritage. An astute policy 
     analyst, strategic leader and gifted executive, Phil ensured 
     the rigorous training and intellectual equipping of a 
     generation of conservative leaders as they passed through 
     Heritage&#x27;s doors. He claimed many scholars, commentators, and 
     members of Congress as former employees and enjoyed pointing 
     out that so and so ``had been at Heritage.&#x27;&#x27; Heritage was 
     never far from his thoughts. When called for jury duty and 
     asked if he had any connection to law enforcement, he replied 
     that well, actually, (former Attorney General) Ed Meese 
     reported to him. He was quickly dismissed.
       A frustrated architect and contractor, over the years he 
     initiated and managed the physical transformation of Heritage 
     from a townhouse on Capitol Hill to the block long 250,000 
     square foot complex in the shadow of the Capitol that it is 
     today. Along the way he realized he loved the challenges of 
     acquisition and renovation. During the years when there was 
     no project at Heritage, he put his skills to work in the 
     Washington residential real estate market. He and Ann moved 
     seven times in 37 years--in contiguous zip codes.
       Christmas vacations usually required a passport. He 
     believed traveling together was the best present he could 
     give his family--his favorite trip was floating down the Nile 
     in perfect weather on Christmas day. He also traveled the 
     world to attend meetings of the Mont Pelerin Society and for 
     20 years spent the weekend after New Year&#x27;s at Sea Island 
     attending The Awakening. The August congressional recess 
     meant several weeks at High Hampton in the western North 
     Carolina mountains. After retirement, he and Ann split their 
     time between beautiful Cashiers, NC, and Charleston, SC. He 
     also took up oil painting, concentrating on landscapes in the 
     mountains and water and marsh scenes from the Low country.
       He was an easy man to like, with a ready smile and a kind 
     heart. His optimism was contagious and he rarely raised his 
     voice. He was kind, gracious and gentle. His integrity was 
     unquestioned and his word was his bond. He was proud of his 
     children for their accomplishments but principally for their 
     character.
       While raised a Southern Baptist, he attended Catholic 
     Church with his family every Sunday, believing that a family 
     should worship together. After the children were grown, he 
     found a home in the Episcopal Church and became a member of 
     the Church of the Good Shepherd in Cashiers. He attended 
     Grace Church Cathedral in Charleston.
       He is survived by his wife, Ann Wrobleski; their children 
     and their spouses Mason (and Hunter), Walker (and Karen), and 
     Sutton (and Ashley); and grandchildren, Halliday and Myers 
     Morris; his sister, Linda (and Ted) and brother, Mason.

CELEBRATING THE 55TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALTAMED HEALTH SERVICES CORPORATION

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. LINDA T. SANCHEZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 23, 2024

  Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate AltaMed Health 
Services Corporation on its 55th anniversary. As the nation&#x27;s largest 
system of independent Federally Qualified Health Centers, AltaMed has 
been delivering quality health care and empowering communities for over 
half a century.
  AltaMed was founded in 1969 as the East LA Barrio Free Clinic, a 
small volunteer-run clinic funded solely by grants and donations. 
Today, AltaMed is California&#x27;s premier community health network, 
encompassing more than 60 service delivery sites throughout Los Angeles 
and Orange Counties, and staffed by a culturally and linguistically 
competent workforce of more than 5,000 employees. It provides care to 
more than 500,000 individuals and their families through two million 
encounters annually, delivering the full continuum of services 
including pediatrics, comprehensive primary care, obstetrics and 
gynecology, dental care, behavioral health, youth services, HIV/AIDS 
services, and senior services through its operations as the largest 
Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) in California. To 
this day, AltaMed is committed to providing quality care without 
exception and working to address health disparities in our communities.
  In 1982, AltaMed began offering senior services by opening its first 
Adult Day Health Care Center in East Los Angeles, providing medical and 
rehabilitative care to older adults. In 1996, AltaMed made the 
transition to PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly), a 
world-class managed-care program that uses a unique team-based approach 
to provide frail older adults with medical, social, nutritional, and 
rehabilitation services. This program makes it possible for those who 
meet nursing home eligibility requirements to remain at home, enjoying 
the comfort and reassurance of familiar surroundings while receiving 
the care they need. AltaMed currently serves over 3,000 older adults at 
12 PACE locations in Los Angeles and Orange County.
  With the passing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, more Americans 
are insured today than ever before--including the 20 million uninsured 
Americans who gained access to comprehensive health coverage. AltaMed 
led widespread efforts through its service delivery sites to enroll and 
provide resources to newly eligible individuals, becoming Covered 
California&#x27;s top certified enrollment entity for several years in a 
row, and earning a grant through the state&#x27;s Navigator Program.
  AltaMed&#x27;s commitment to addressing the social determinants of health 
that contribute to eighty percent of patient health outcomes and 
dedication to advancing social justice, equity, diversity, and 
inclusion is exemplified through its programming and service delivery 
approach. In 2017, it launched the AltaMed Institute for Health Equity 
which works to inform and support the elimination of health disparities 
that disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities through 
innovation, education, research, and community engagement.
  The following year, AltaMed launched a first-of-its-kind effort to 
make service sites serve as civic engagement hubs for patients and 
community. Through this civic engagement campaign, AltaMed supports 
local voter information, education, and mobilization efforts, provides 
community workshops on the citizenship process, and facilitates 
dialogue around public policy and advocacy.
  AltaMed was also on the frontlines when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 
2020, and sprang into action. Early on, it established mobile testing 
and evaluation sites throughout its communities to ensure patients 
could continue to access care. In 2021, leveraging the experience and 
success of its My Vote. My Health campaign, AltaMed launched a public 
health vaccination campaign called eAndale! qQue Esperas? reaching more 
than 4.45 million Latinos in the state. By the end of that ten-month 
campaign effort, it had helped vaccinate over 130,000 people against 
COVID-19 leading a coalition of Community Health Centers throughout the 
state.
  This is all to show how AltaMed has led the way to ensure their 
patients have access to culturally and linguistically concordant care 
while also addressing health care workforce challenges. In 2020, it 
welcomed the first cohort of AltaMed Family Medicine Residents to a new 
residency program. Two years later, it launched a licensed vocational 
nurse to registered nurse pathway program and other training programs, 
supporting over 160 nurses to advance their careers. And this year, 
AltaMed became the first clinic in Southern California to participate 
in the state&#x27;s Licensed Physicians from Mexico Pilot Program (LPMPP), 
welcoming seven physicians who provide culturally and linguistically 
aligned care to Spanish speaking patients.
  On November 8, 2024, AltaMed will commemorate its 55th anniversary. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating AltaMed 
on this historic milestone as an exceptional health care leader, 
advancing quality care for Latino, multi-ethnic, and underserved 
communities in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, and helping other 
Community Health Centers throughout the state scale up their efforts to 
address health disparities through transformational change.

    CELEBRATING THE HANOVER FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR 135 YEARS OF SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DARIN LaHOOD

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 23, 2024

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Hanover 
volunteer Fire Department of Hanover, Illinois for celebrating their 
135th anniversary.
  In the 1800&#x27;s, Hanover&#x27;s file protection was virtually non-existent. 
The Hanover community rallied together to organize a fire company and 
purchased a Button hand fire engine in the summer of 1889. Later in 
1890, a 414-pound fire alarm bell was gifted to the fire company by the 
ladies of Hanover and a tower was built on the North side of the town 
hall to house it.
  On January 29, 1924, a new volunteer fire company was organized by 
twenty-two men. In the summer of 1942, the War Public Works Fire 
Station was built and was used by the Hanover Fire Department until 
another building, located at 201 Fillmore Street, was completed in 
1970. The Hanover Fire Department remains at that Fillmore Street 
location to this day.
  The illustrious history of the Hanover Fire Department is a testament 
to the strong spirit of community present in Illinois and demonstrates 
the importance of first responders and their service. As a Member of 
Congress, I will continue to support Illinois communities like Hanover 
and their emergency first responders who honorably serve their 
communities.
  For 135 years, the Hanover Fire Department has served the residents 
of Hanover and Hanover Township and is possibly the oldest and largest 
volunteer fire department in Illinois. Today, we celebrate the 
Department and commend its multitude of volunteer fire fighters for 
their dedication to Hanover. I extend my sincere congratulations to the 
Hanover Volunteer Fire Department of Illinois for a successful 135 
years, and I wish them even more success going forward.

            HONORING THE LIFE AND WORK OF MARGARITA GONZALEZ

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KATHY CASTOR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 23, 2024

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
and contributions of Margarita Gonzalez, a Tampa trailblazer and 
outspoken advocate for our diverse Hispanic community. Margarita served 
the City of Tampa for nearly 30 years as the City&#x27;s first Hispanic 
community liaison and in other important roles Margarita was a beloved 
champion for Tampa&#x27;s Hispanic families and small business owners, and 
she leaves behind a vibrant legacy that will support Tampenos for 
decades to come.
  Margarita and her family fled Cuba and arrived in Florida on July 4, 
1966. At age 12, she was one of the first Cuban refugee students in the 
Hillsborough County Schools. She always knew the importance of 
education, and despite not knowing any English, she was motivated to 
work hard, learn English and get involved in school activities.
  After graduating from Leto High School, Margarita began working on 
her bachelor&#x27;s degree at Hillsborough Community College. For the next 
13 years, Margarita attended college classes while juggling full-time 
jobs. She never gave up on her studies because she personally 
understood the irreplaceable value of an education. ``After losing 
everything, I realized that a person&#x27;s biggest asset is their 
education,&#x27;&#x27; said Gonzalez. ``Knowledge and skills cannot be taken away 
from you.&#x27;&#x27;
  She worked for the Tampa Port Authority and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber 
of Commerce and continued her education by completing a bachelor&#x27;s 
degree in public relations and communications from the University of 
South Florida. In 1987, Margarita began working for the City of Tampa 
and Mayor Sandy Freedman, doing community relations and interpretation 
work. Margarita saw a need for Hispanic members of the community to 
learn about the opportunities and services the city provided. It was 
then that Margarita began producing and hosting two Hispanic television 
shows, Nuestra Tampa and Community Affairs Report.
  Throughout her nearly 30 years of service to the City of Tampa, 
Margarita&#x27;s responsibilities included community relations, 
communications, coordinating the Mayor&#x27;s Hispanic Advisory Council, 
establishing the city&#x27;s International Affairs Office, and as a human 
rights investigator, which is important to support a diverse, 
respectful and inclusive community for our neighbors, families and 
businesses. While serving our City, Margarita established the Mayor&#x27;s 
Hispanic Heritage Committee, which is committed to preserving and 
celebrating Tampa&#x27;s vibrant Hispanic culture. Margarita also ensured 
that part of Hispanic Heritage Committee&#x27;s work is to provide mentoring 
and scholarship programs to local students.
  Margarita won many awards for her service work, including Hispanic 
Woman of the Year by Tampa Hispanic Heritage, the 2019 Latina Lideres 
Award by the Latin Times, the 2023 Hillsborough County Women&#x27;s Hall of 
Fame inductee, and the 2021 Tampa Bay Lightning Hero award, among many 
others. She was the first Hispanic woman to serve as a member of the 
Superbowl Task Force in 1991 and chairperson of the Tampa Hillsborough 
County Youth Council.
  Margarita made it her life&#x27;s work to ensure that students in need 
were supported. She was a founding member of the Hispanic Professional 
Women&#x27;s Association (HPWA) and Foundation (HPWF) and served on the 
boards of many other community service organizations. Through the HPWF 
and the donation of $50,000 she received as a Tampa Bay Lightning 
Community Hero Award recipient, Margarita established The Margarita 
Gonzalez HPWF Latino Endowed Scholarship, her own endowment at USF for 
local high-achieving, Spanish-speaking students with demonstrated need. 
Margarita was able to attend college herself because of scholarships, 
and she said it was ``a dream come true&#x27;&#x27; to be able to give back in 
this way Margarita hoped that supporting future generations would 
inspire them to support others as well.
  Margarita was a truly selfless and charitable leader. She also was a 
devoted daughter and loving caretaker to her mother, Angela Elba 
Gonzalez. Margarita&#x27;s legacy will continue to live through her mother, 
her sister Elba Cruz and husband Hiram and her nephew and godson 
Michael Cruz, his wife Rebecca and their two daughters.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my neighbors across the Tampa Bay area and 
the citizens of Florida, I am proud to honor Margarita Gonzalez for her 
lifelong dedication to education and service. It is selfless community 
servants like Margarita that make Tampa the welcoming and generous 
place it is today. Our community is eternally grateful for her immense 
contributions. I trust that Margarita Gonzalez&#x27;s legacy will inspire 
others to serve their neighbors and live the American Dream.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 23, 2024

  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
memory of Sam Martinez and to commemorate how his legacy has inspired 
change in Congress.
  This week, the House of Representatives will consider the Stop Campus 
Hazing Act. This bill was brought to my attention by the advocacy of 
Mr. Martinez&#x27;s family, and I cosponsored this bill shortly after 
meeting his parents. Today, I address the House as a proud cosponsor of 
this legislation, and I urge its passage.
  Mr. Martinez was a Bellevue resident and Washington State University 
student whose life was tragically cut short on November 12, 2019, at 
the age of 19. He was a beloved son, brother, and friend, and my heart 
is with the community he leaves behind.
  Mr. Martinez was born in 2000 to parents Hector Martinez and Jolayne 
Houtz. He grew up as a brother to Ariana Martinez in Bellevue, 
Washington, and throughout his life he was surrounded by friends and 
loved ones. Those who loved him remember his fierce athleticism on the 
soccer pitch, his dry sense of humor, his intelligence, his commitment 
to volunteer work locally and abroad, and his loyalty to his friends 
and family. He was in the Bellevue School District&#x27;s Spanish immersion 
program and graduated from Newport High School in June 2019. In the 
fall of 2019, Mr. Martinez matriculated at Washington State University, 
where he planned to study business and entrepreneurship.
  Mr. Speaker, as the House considers the Stop Campus Hazing Act this 
week, let us remember Mr. Martinez and call attention to this critical 
issue that impacts students like Mr. Martinez nationwide. My thoughts 
are with his family and loved ones as we honor his legacy today.

                          ____________________

               NEWSLETTER FROM CONGRESSMAN CHUCK EDWARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 23, 2024

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents on issues surrounding 
foreign policy, border security and small businesses.

       Dear Friend, Three years ago, 13 U.S. servicemembers were 
     killed in the Abbey Gate terrorist attack in Kabul, 
     Afghanistan, during the final days of the Afghanistan 
     withdrawal.

[[Page E947]]

       The House Committee on Foreign Affairs recently released 
     the report on its investigation of during and after the 
     rushed withdrawal, ``Willful Blindness: An Assessment of the 
     Biden-Harris Administration&#x27;s Withdrawal from Afghanistan and 
     the Chaos that Followed.&#x27;&#x27;
       The committee found that the Biden-Harris administration 
     was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan no matter the 
     costs, prioritizing the optics of the withdrawal over the 
     security of U.S. personnel and failing to plan for all 
     contingencies.
       The administration&#x27;s hasty decisions and disregard for U.S. 
     personnel on the ground during the withdrawal led to the 
     deaths of 13 of our military members by a terrorist attack on 
     Aug. 26, 2021, the deadliest day for our military in 
     Afghanistan since 2012.
       This catastrophic withdrawal not only resulted in the 
     deaths of our servicemembers, it has also weakened U.S. 
     national security, with Afghanistan once again becoming a 
     haven for terrorists, and has damaged U.S. credibility on the 
     world stage after abandoning our Afghan allies to Taliban 
     revenge killings.
       This tragedy was preventable, and the Biden-Harris 
     administration has yet to take accountability for its 
     failures or even meet with the Gold Star families of our 
     fallen soldiers. Americans will never forget the ultimate 
     sacrifice made in defense of our nation by:

                     Standing up to Communist China

       The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) represents the greatest 
     threat to American values and national security in our 
     lifetime, and we must counter the CCP&#x27;s efforts to gain 
     leverage over our nation and beyond. President Xi Jinping has 
     gone so far as to say that he will do whatever it takes to 
     bring Taiwan under his control, including through military 
     force.
       From securing our supply chains and protecting American 
     technology to defending American biosecurity and drug 
     manufacturing, the nearly three dozen bills that the House 
     advanced are a step toward reducing China&#x27;s leverage over the 
     U.S. and strengthening U.S. dominance.
       Just one of the bills that I am co-sponsoring and voted for 
     that would directly affect Western North Carolina is the 
     Protecting American Agriculture from Foreign Adversaries Act, 
     which amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to require 
     the Secretary of Agriculture to be included on the Committee 
     on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for 
     agriculture-related issues. It also requires CFIUS to review 
     and potentially block purchases of farmland by foreign 
     adversaries that pose a national security risk.
       We cannot allow enemies of the U.S. to buy up America&#x27;s 
     farmland, which poses a food and national security threat, 
     and I will continue to work with the House to combat the 
     CCP&#x27;s aggression here at home and overseas.


     Biden-Harris administration&#x27;s ``America Last&#x27;&#x27; foreign policy

       Over the past three and a half years, the Biden-Harris 
     administration&#x27;s policies have put Americans last, 
     diminishing our national security and draining hard-working 
     Western North Carolinians&#x27; hard-earned savings.
       This administration&#x27;s failed policies have caused sky-high 
     inflation, record-high gas prices and an unprecedented 
     invasion of our borders.
       During my district work period, constituent after 
     constituent--including many small-business owners--have 
     shared about the effects of high prices on running a 
     business.
       Meanwhile, thousands of illegal immigrants continue to 
     flood our borders, endangering the safety and well-being of 
     every American.
       The radical, sanctuary-city policies are incentivizing 
     illegal immigration, and your hard-earned tax dollars should 
     not be used to serve illegal immigrants and further signal to 
     the world that America&#x27;s borders are open.
       To reverse such harmful policies that are rewarding illegal 
     immigration and to protect women from sex offenders and 
     abusers, I voted for the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act 
     and the Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act and will 
     continue to push for policies that serve the best interests 
     of our citizens and nation.


                   Championing Main Street businesses

       The National Federation of Independent Business is a voice 
     for small businesses across our nation, and I&#x27;m grateful to 
     have been selected for this year&#x27;s Small Business Guardian 
     Award.
       As someone whose background is in business, I understand 
     the challenges that Main Street faces, including heavy-handed 
     government regulations. We need more pro-growth, pro-small-
     business policies so that small businesses can thrive and 
     create jobs.


                  Welcoming WNC Chamber members to DC

       It was a privilege to welcome members of WNC Chambers of 
     Commerce for their retreat during which they focused on 
     problem-solving and opportunities to improve workforce 
     development and local economies.
       America&#x27;s risk takers and job creators have long been under 
     attack from Washington, and I&#x27;m striving to reduce 
     regulations, create a better tax climate, and help develop a 
     workforce that provides opportunity and fuels our economy by 
     fixing how Washington works.
           With my warmest regards,
                                                     Chad Edwards,
     Member of Congress.

    RECOGNIZING THE MISSION QUILTERS FOR THEIR HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Monday, September 23, 2024

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I wish to bring to my colleagues&#x27; 
attention, the outstanding work of Mission Quilters which recently 
completed their 10,000th quilt that will be donated to global 
communities in need of basic supplies.
  Mission Quilters is a group of about 20 volunteers at the Lord of 
Life Lutheran Church in Schaumburg, who gather every Thursday morning 
to stitch quilts. This tradition dates to 1985, when Carol Langseth, 
the wife of the church&#x27;s then-pastor, had the goal of creating handmade 
quilts to provide comfort to those in need around the world. I am very 
pleased to report that just last week, the group reached a milestone 
with their 10,000th quilt. These quilts are distributed both locally 
and to communities in nine countries, through the Lutheran World Relief 
organization.
  Mission Quilters relies on the donations of materials from individual 
quilters and other organizations. These materials are then cut and used 
to create a variety of quilts. Volunteers participate in the process by 
sewing and layering the quilt squares. Working together, they produce 
at least four quilts per week. In fact, the quilts produced by Mission 
Quilters could cover 185 football fields and stretch 22,222 yards. The 
finished quilts are first used

[[Page E949]]

to adorn the pews of the Lord of Life Lutheran Church and, after being 
blessed, are sent to various parts of the world.
  For nearly 40 years, Mission Quilters have donated their quilts to 
countries such as Georgia, Tanzania, Ukraine, Angola, Mali, Guatemala, 
and the Democratic Republic of Congo Mission Quilters&#x27; quilts have also 
comforted Syrian refugees in Lebanon, as well as in other parts of the 
world that are affected by war. Locally, they have kept our communities 
warm, by distributing their quilts through organizations such as North 
Side Housing and Supportive Services in Chicago, WINGS, and Lutheran 
Social Services of Illinois for those in need.
  The men and women of Mission Quilters embody public service at its 
best. As their representative in Congress, I am deeply honored to 
recognize the significant contributions of Mission Quilters. They have 
helped to bring families together and provided support to those 
affected by war and natural disasters through their quilting. It is for 
this impact that I wish to extend my gratitude and appreciation to the 
Mission Quilters.
