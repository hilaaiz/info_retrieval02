             CELEBRATING RAYMOND PATNAUDE&#x27;S 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RUDY YAKYM III

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and celebrate 
World War II veteran Raymond Francis Patnaude, who turns 100 years old 
this week.
  Born on August 9, 1923, Raymond embodies what it means to be a member 
of the ``Greatest Generation.&#x27;&#x27; When the forces of fascism threatened 
the peace, security, and freedom of millions upon millions, Raymond 
answered the call to serve, enlisting in the Army and eventually 
serving in the 97th Infantry ``Trident&#x27;&#x27; Division.
  President Ronald Reagan reminded us that freedom is fragile and must 
constantly be fought for and guarded by each generation. That noble 
mission is exactly what Raymond helped carry out when he wore the 
uniform of the United States Military. Because of the service and 
sacrifice of veterans, generations of Americans have been able to 
experience the blessings of liberty and live in a land that is free. 
For that, all of us owe Raymond and his fellow veterans a debt that we 
can never fully repay.
  Following his military service, Raymond and his late wife Beulah 
settled in South Bend, where Raymond bought and successfully operated 
McDonald Studio, the oldest photography studio in the South Bend area. 
In fact, many high school alumni from South Bend from the past half-
century came to McDonald Studio for their senior photos. Others came to 
know Raymond and his professionalism along with his kind, generous 
nature at weddings, communions, and community engagements.
  Together, Raymond and Beulah also had five children together: Ray 
Jr., David, Philip, Chris and Paulette. All five children worked in the 
studio at some point, which is a testament to the loving and tight-knit 
family that Raymond and Beulah built.
  As Raymond celebrates with his family a century of life well lived, I 
join countless Hoosiers in wishing Raymond a very Happy 100th Birthday. 
I also commend him for his loyal service and the many, many 
contributions he has made to the South Bend community, Indiana&#x27;s Second 
Congressional District, and our country. Godspeed Raymond.

                          ____________________

          CELEBRATING THE FIRST ANNUAL LAKE WINNIPESAUKEE DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHRIS PAPPAS

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the town of 
Wolfeboro, New Hampshire for hosting the first ever Lake Winnipesaukee 
Day celebration. Lake Winnipesaukee is 1 of the treasures of our state, 
a recreation and tourism hub, and an economic driver for the entire 
region. Above all, it is a precious natural resource and habitat that 
we must continue to protect and preserve for generations to come. With 
proceeds benefiting advocacy groups fighting to preserve the quality of 
the lake, Lake Winnipesaukee Day is a shining example of Wolfeboro&#x27;s 
commitment to keeping Lake Winnipesaukee clean and healthy for years to 
come.
  The Lake Winnipesaukee Day celebration brings together 8 different 
non-profit climate advocacy organizations to educate visitors and 
highlight the importance of climate action and preservation in the Lake 
Winnipesaukee region. The celebration&#x27;s live laser shows, food, drinks, 
games, and music have worked to create an engaging local space that 
will serve as both an opportunity and prominent platform for climate 
groups to advocate and educate. New Hampshire&#x27;s way of life is rooted 
in our natural surroundings, and it is the responsibility of each and 
every 1 of us to ensure that future generations can enjoy the benefits 
and beauty of our natural environment. I sincerely commend Wolfeboro&#x27;s 
work to raise awareness and forge an impassioned, strong community of 
well-informed citizens, and I look forward to many more Lake 
Winnipesaukee Day celebrations in the future.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I want to congratulate the Town of Wolfeboro for its 
dedication to the protection of Lake Winnipesaukee, and the work it has 
done to educate and advocate for climate change action. I am proud to 
represent residents of Wolfeboro in Congress, and I can&#x27;t wait to see 
the success of this celebration in the years to come.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MIKE THOMPSON

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor KBBF 
and the Bilingual Broadcasting Foundation to recognize their 50 years 
of providing reliable, bilingual public radio for the North Bay.
  The Bilingual Broadcasting Foundation was founded in 1971 with KBBF&#x27;s 
first broadcast airing in 1973. Spurred on by the Chicano movement, 
KBBF&#x27;s founders pioneered a new model to engage our entire community in 
all public broadcastings benefits of education, culture, and news 
access. KBBF is the first bilingual, bicultural radio station in the 
United States of America. Today, the station reaches five million 
households and specializes in English, Spanish, and several indigenous 
languages. Of their many listeners, one million are from primarily 
Spanish-speaking households.
  Since 1973, KBBF has been primarily run by volunteers. Their team 
remains a critical source of information for many Spanish-speaking 
members of our community. In 2017, when numerous wildfires devastated 
Sonoma and Napa Counties, KBBF was instrumental in helping to translate 
lifesaving evacuation guidance for Spanish-speaking residents of our 
region who were seeking critical public safety news.
  In recognition of their decades of work, KBBF was honored with the 
2020 Silver Heart Award by the Northern California Chapter of the 
Society of Professional Journalists. The station has been a vital 
resource of information and services for the Latino community. KBBF is 
vital in increasing access to information at the local, state, and 
national level.
  Mr. Speaker, it is evident that that, for half a century, KBBF has 
been an outstanding public broadcasting service for our multilingual 
population in Northern California.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with Congressman Mike Thompson 
to honor the memory of highly regarded, fourth-generation wine grower 
Paul Eagan Dolan, III, who passed away on June 26, 2023.
  Born in Oakland, California in 1950, Paul spent his childhood summers 
at his family&#x27;s Asti Villa in Sonoma County. His mother&#x27;s family 
heritage includes Pietro Carlo Rossi, the Italian immigrant who founded 
the Italian Swiss Colony Winery. Paul&#x27;s summers in Asti inspired his 
passion for winemaking.
  Paul graduated from Bishop O&#x27;Dowd High School in 1968. He earned a 
Bachelor of Arts degree from Santa Clara University while also serving 
in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). After three years of 
military service, Paul moved to Fresno, CA, where he earned a Masters 
in Enology at California State University in 1977.
  Upon graduation, Paul started his first winemaking job with Fetzer 
Vineyards, where he worked for 27 years, eventually serving as 
President. The business flourished under his leadership. In 1991 Fetzer 
was rebranded as Bonterra Wines, the first national brand made from 100 
percent organically grown grapes. Paul&#x27;s notable achievements included 
being named Winemaker of the Year by the LA Times in 1991. During this 
period, he also founded a small distribution of wine under the Dolan 
Vineyards brand.
  Paul passionately believed business could be a force for good, and 
throughout his life, he demonstrated beneficial practices for 
sustainable wine production. In 2002, he held the first biodynamic 
symposium in the United States, which was joined by winegrowers from 
across the globe. After helping to establish the Wine Institute&#x27;s 
Sustainable Winegrowers Alliance, and becoming its first chairman, he 
helped introduce the Code of Sustainable Wine Growing. In 2003 he 
memorialized his theory for business as a positive force in his 
watershed book titled ``True to Your Roots: Fermenting a Business 
Revolution.&#x27;&#x27;
  Paul continued to share his commitment to organic, biodynamic, and 
regenerative farming as he became Chairman of the Wine Institute in 
2006. Paul would go on to serve as Chairman of the Demeter USA board, 
where his influence on winegrowing expanded to international audiences 
through the International Biodynamic Wine Conference. He was the first 
wine industry representative on the Regenerative Organic Alliance.
  Paul&#x27;s legacy includes powerful demonstrations of the benefits of 
biodynamic principles, including the transformation of a run-down 156-
acre hillside property in rural Mendocino County into the vibrant, 
lush, and sustainably farmed Dark Horse Ranch; and the more recent 
creation of Truett-Hurst Winery, home to

[[Page E763]]

26 acres of biodynamic certified estate vines, set amid a remarkable 
backdrop of a restored creek and riparian areas, home to fish, fowl, 
and wildlife.
  Mr. Speaker, Paul&#x27;s passion for biodynamic and organic farming was 
rooted in his deep respect for natural cycles, his reverence for the 
land, and his belief that agricultural business has responsibility 
beyond generating profit to preserving and restoring land. We 
respectfully ask that you join us in extending deep condolences to 
Paul&#x27;s family and many friends, and in expressing our strong 
appreciation for Paul&#x27;s decades of leadership in responsible winemaking 
and sustainability.

  HONORING REV. DR. TOMMIE JACKSON, FROM JANUARY 18, 1954 TO JULY 26, 
                                  2023

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JAMES A. HIMES

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a 
tremendously impactful leader and my good friend, Stamford&#x27;s own 
Reverend Tommie Jackson. Dr. Jackson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, 
the third of 6 children. Dr. Jackson was raised in Baltimore City and 
was a product of the Baltimore Public School System. He graduated from 
Baltimore City College High School and attended the prestigious 
Morehouse University in Georgia. He later attended the University of 
Maryland, Baltimore County, where he met his wife, and life partner, 
Dorye Michelle Emory.
  Dr. Jackson and Dorye were married in 1977 and shortly after moved to 
Houston, Texas where he attended Texas Southern University in pursuit 
of his Juris Doctor. The Jacksons would later return to Baltimore, 
Maryland where he completed law school at the University of Maryland 
Law School.
  Dr. Jackson was enormously proud of his daughters, Erin Marie and 
Evinn Leigh. He answered his first call to Pastorship in 1990, at 
Calvary Baptist Church in Chester, Pennsylvania. While there, Dr. 
Jackson, Dorye and his daughters touched the lives of the community. 
Dr. Jackson&#x27;s dedication to God&#x27;s work then brought him and his family 
to Stamford, Connecticut in 1997, where he answered his second calling 
to Pastorship at Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church.
  For 20 years, Dr. Jackson served as the Pastor of Faith Tabernacle. 
During his tenure at Faith, he spearheaded the expansion of his church. 
He served the Stamford community with a weekly food bank and held back-
to-school drives to equip children and families with supplies. Dr. 
Jackson was a proponent of education and took the time to mentor and 
prepare students in the congregation and in the community for academic 
excellence. Upon completing his doctorate degree at New York 
Theological Seminary, he went on to become

[[Page E765]]

part of the faculty, leading, guiding and mentoring aspiring faith 
leaders. Dr. Jackson served as a spiritual advisor and mentor for the 
congregation and for the community.
  In 2018, Dr. Jackson founded the Rehoboth Followship Church. He was 
diligent in fostering this ministry and created a welcoming place of 
worship for all. He loved his Rehoboth family and was always thinking 
of ways to expand the ministry.
  I was honored to join Dr. Jackson in his tireless work to bring 
together faith leaders, register and empower voters, combat the scourge 
of gun violence in our communities, remedy the historic wrongs of our 
criminal justice system, and inspire the next generation to seize 
opportunities to get an education and improve the world they will soon 
enter.
  Whenever they needed something good for the community done, they 
didn&#x27;t have to seek out Dr. Jackson. He was already there, and he 
welcomed them with open arms. Dr. Jackson was a tremendous advocate for 
his community, at the local and state level, and I was proud to call 
him my friend.
  This world has lost a great leader. I dedicate today to mourning and 
remembrance as well as furthering Dr. Jackson&#x27;s legacy of service and 
sacrifice and uplifting those who follow in his path. May we all be 
even half as successful as Dr. Jackson was at leaving the world a 
better place than we found it.

                   HONORING THE LIFE OF JEFFREY POST

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOE COURTNEY

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of an 
exemplary first responder and citizen, Jeffrey Post of Gales Ferry, 
Connecticut. Jeffrey served nobly in his role as Assistant Fire Chief 
for the Submarine Base New London Fire Department. He very sadly passed 
August 2nd lovingly surrounded by his family and colleagues.
  Born to Steven and Cynthia Post in July 1979, it became apparent at 
an early age that Jeffrey&#x27;s destiny lay in service to his fellow 
citizens. By the age of 14, he joined the Old Mystic Fire Department&#x27;s 
junior cadet program, beginning a journey in fire and rescue which 
would define his life. This cadet program additionally ingrained the 
spirit of volunteerism in Jeffrey, and he would happily dedicate his 
personal time to fire departments across the southeast Connecticut 
region. For example, he volunteered with the Mystic Fire Department 
Hook and Ladder Company, Gales Ferry Fire Company, and acted as the 
Chief of Center Groton Fire Department.
  Jeffrey&#x27;s actual professional firefighting journey began in 1999 when 
he joined the Mohegan Tribal Fire Department. Soon after, he would 
continue his emergency response services by joining the SUBASE Fire 
Department in 2001. In this position, Jeffrey would help maintain the 
United States&#x27; national defense by ensuring the safety of those 
stationed in SUBASE through his knowledge of EMT and HAZMAT rescue 
practices. It is in SUBASE where Asst. Chief Post would become the 
fixture of southeast Connecticut&#x27;s firefighting community that he is 
known as today. By 2009, Jeffrey was promoted to Captain in the SBFD. 
In 2015, he found himself the role of Assistant Chief. Throughout his 
distinguished career, Jeffrey cultivated a reputation for bravery, 
intelligence, and team-oriented leadership, qualities which 
distinguished his already impressive firefighting knowledge base.
  Jeffrey didn&#x27;t hoard his incredible knowledge to himself. Instead, he 
served as a fire instructor for a large portion of his career, ensuring 
that the fantastic amount of institutional knowledge he amassed 
throughout his career would inform the next generation of firefighters. 
Jeffrey served as adjunct faculty for both the Eastern Connecticut Fire 
School and Connecticut Fire Academy, two institutions which provide 
critical EMT and fire training. In 2014, Jeffrey took his teaching one 
step further by opening a training company with some of his colleagues 
named All Hands Operating.
  In one anecdote that typifies the incredible reach of Asst. Chief 
Post&#x27;s fire fighting abilities, Jeffrey organized and led the SBFD&#x27;s 
response team to aid in suppressing a blazing inferno that ultimately 
destroyed the USS Miami, a Los Angeles class submarine at the 
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. That fire lasted an 
astonishing 12 hours that local firefighters were unable to contain. 
The chief and his team drove through the night to provide their unique 
training to extinguish the blaze. Temperatures from the fire exceeded 
1,000 degrees, melting the innards of Miami, yet because of the 
expertise of the SUBASE Fire Department no lives were lost. More 
recently, Jeffrey used his knowledge and experience to rescue a man who 
fell down a 30 foot well in Ledyard, Connecticut. It was due to 
Jeffrey&#x27;s technical ability and expertise in confined space rescue that 
allowed for a swift resolution to what could have amounted to a dire 
circumstance for the man who fell.
  Mr. Speaker, although we mourn the profound loss our region has 
experienced in the passing of Asst. Chief Post, we can take solace in 
his inspiring legacy of the lives he saved, and the countless 
colleagues he has positively impacted throughout his life--whether as a 
rescuer or mentor. It is during this time that we pay special attention 
to Jeffrey&#x27;s family, his wife Chrissy; two children, Olivia and John; 
brothers Scott and Daniel; parents Steven and Cynthia; and extended 
family. To this end, I ask that my colleagues in this chamber join me 
in honoring the example left by Asst. Chief Post.

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Commission of Fine 
Arts District of Columbia Home Rule Act. This bill would remove the 
authority of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) over non-federal real 
property in the District of Columbia.
  Under presidential executive orders (EOs) and federal law, the CFA 
has review authority for D.C.-owned parks and buildings, as well as for 
certain private land in D.C. Under the relevant EOs, CFA has review 
authority for the design of D.C.-owned parks and buildings. Under the 
Shipstead-Luce Act, CFA has review authority for the design of private 
buildings in D.C. ``adjacent to public buildings and grounds of major 
importance,&#x27;&#x27; such as Rock Creek Park and the Potomac riverfront. Under 
the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA has review authority for the design of 
private buildings in the part of Georgetown referred to as ``Old 
Georgetown&#x27;&#x27; in the act.
  The federal government, including the CFA, whose members are 
appointed by the President, has no business in D.C. land-use policies 
and decisions unrelated to the federal presence. Not only is the 
federal government&#x27;s authority over D.C. buildings and private property 
a violation of home rule, it also delays and increases the cost of 
public and private development in D.C.
  This bill is an important step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge 
my colleagues to support it.

                          ____________________

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
and recognize the 65th Anniversary of Operation Sunshine, a scientific 
expedition on behalf of the United States Navy that sent our Nation&#x27;s 
first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, to the North Pole.
  Nicknaming themselves ``PANOPOs&#x27;&#x27;, an acronym from the phrase 
``Pacific to the Atlantic via the North Pole&#x27;&#x27;, one-hundred and sixteen 
crew members made the historic voyage under the polar ice, showing true 
American dominance in science, innovation, and naval capability.
  On behalf of Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th Congressional District, I am proud 
to recognize the 65th Anniversary of Operation Sunshine and thank both 
Nautilus Alumni Association and the Submarine Force Library and Museum 
Association for their dedication to keeping American history alive.

  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 150th 
anniversary of the founding of the Homer Fire Department in Cortland 
County, New York.
  The Homer Fire Department was established on April 10, 1873 as part 
of the Village of Homer. Since then, the all-volunteer department has 
worked tirelessly to protect the citizens of Homer and has served as a 
backbone of their community.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in 
recognizing the Homer Fire Department on their 150th anniversary. It is 
my sincere privilege to honor all the volunteer firefighters who have 
kept Homer safe since 1873 and continue to do so today.

                        RECOGNIZING TOM SIGMUND

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tom Sigmund for 
his service and accomplishments as the executive director of NEW Water 
and president of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies.
  Mr. Sigmund has committed his career to improving water quality 
throughout Wisconsin, as well as promoting a national water policy to 
create a more equitable water future. On July 13, 2023, Mr. Sigmund 
completed his service as president of the National Association of Clean 
Water Agencies. I stand today to recognize Mr. Sigmund&#x27;s impressive 
leadership at NACWA as well as his service to the clean water industry.
  Since 2007, Mr. Sigmund has led NEW Water, the brand of the Green Bay 
Metropolitan Sewerage District, as its executive director, facilitating 
the delivery of the utility&#x27;s wholesale conveyance and treatment 
services to 238,000 people throughout 15 municipalities in Northeast 
Wisconsin. Under Mr. Sigmund&#x27;s leadership, NEW Water has achieved 100 
percent permit compliance and ushered in a new era for the utility in 
recognizing that material sent to the facilities is a valuable resource 
to be recovered and reused. He orchestrated the Resource Recovery and 
Electrical Energy, or R2E2, project, which recovers valuable resources 
from the wastewater stream to produce electricity and recovers heat for 
processes that run the facility.
  Mr. Sigmund aided in creating a circular reclaimed water system that 
was developed with a national paper mill, boosting economic development 
for the region, and providing a sustainable solution for the industry. 
Mr. Sigmund launched an adaptive management approach to achieve water 
quality improvements more cost effectively by working collaboratively 
across rural landscapes in the Green Bay watershed. These efforts 
target a reduction of sediment and excess nutrient run-off into 
impaired waterways, an improved ecosystem, and a pathway for continued 
success.
  Under his leadership, NEW Water entered a partnership with NASA to 
advance scientific knowledge of harmful algal blooms and their impact 
on public health. This initiative is housed under NEW Water&#x27;s Aquatic 
Monitoring Program, which was established in 1986 and is one of the 
longest running water quality monitoring programs on the Great Lakes. 
Mr. Sigmund also supports his community by creating an educational 
STEAM Superheroes Camp with the local Boys &amp; Girls Club to build 
critical skillsets, inspire water stewardship, and establish a talent 
pipeline for future employees.
  During the early stages of the pandemic, NEW Water joined the 
Wisconsin Wastewater Surveillance Program to advance public health 
efforts to understand COVID-19 in the community. Mr. Sigmund received 
his Bachelor and Master of Science in Civil and Environmental 
Engineering from the University of Wisconsin. A licensed professional 
engineer in Wisconsin and Ohio, he has served and continues to serve on 
board and leadership positions at various organizations. He chaired the 
Water Resources Utility of the Future Task Force, which developed the 
Water Resources Utility of the Future Blueprint for Action. He served 
as a member of the Utility Advisory Group, where he helped develop 
publications on Effective Utility Management related to water and 
wastewater utilities, as well as other sustainability efforts. A 
recipient of the NACWA President&#x27;s Award, Mr. Sigmund is also a Water 
Environment Federation, or WEF, fellow. He has received the WEF William 
D. Hatfield Award and the WEF Schroepfer Innovative Facility Design 
Medal.
  These accolades and awards attest to Mr. Sigmund&#x27;s dedication to the 
clean water industry. His strong character and visionary leadership 
have been instrumental in charting a course for improved water quality, 
particularly in Lake Michigan&#x27;s Green Bay. I thank Mr. Sigmund for his 
commitment to Northeast Wisconsin, and I congratulate him on completing 
his service as NACWA president.

       REMEMBERING AND HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER MATTHEW HARE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JEFF DUNCAN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, August 8, 2023

  Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service 
of Easley, South Carolina Police Officer, Matthew Hare, who was killed 
in the line of duty on August 2, 2023, while saving the life of an 
individual suffering from a mental health crisis. Officer Hare was 
driven by a desire to serve his community which led to his pursuing a 
career in law enforcement upon graduation from Easley High School. 
Officer Hare is survived by his mother, Ashley Hare, in addition to his 
brother, Easton Hare.
  At only 22 years of age, Officer Hare had just begun his career in 
2022 and showed great promise after completing the SC Criminal Justice 
Academy.
  When not on duty, he loved to be with his family and friends at the 
dinner table, outside on their next adventure, or playing the latest 
video game. Despite many hobbies, Officer Hare always found time to 
cheer on his favorite football team, the Clemson Tigers.
  On August 2, Officer Hare displayed the greatest form of love and act 
of service that can be asked of any police officer. He responded to a 
call for an individual who was suffering from a mental health crisis 
and was precariously on the train tracks in Easley. Knowing a train was 
coming and committed to saving this person he didn&#x27;t know, Officer Hare 
sacrificed himself to save a member of the community he swore to serve 
and protect.
  Mr. Speaker, South Carolina&#x27;s Third District is known for its people 
and is home to countless heroes. I&#x27;m honored to recognize Officer 
Matthew Hare, a hero who was taken from us far too soon. Ashley and 
Easton will carry the fond memories of Officer Hare in their hearts 
forever, and Easley will remember this demonstration of selfless 
service. Officer Hare&#x27;s final actions truly exemplify John 15:13, 
``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for 
his friends.&#x27;&#x27; Thank Officer Hare for choosing to serve and giving us a 
great example of how we ought to love others. The Easley community 
learned this lesson as is evident by the outpouring of support for him 
and his family since his passing. Today, my thoughts and prayers are 
with the Hare family and the Easley Police Department as they lay to 
rest Officer Hare.
