           CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF HOWARD DAVIDSON

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, April 2, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish a happy 100th birthday to Mr. 
Howard Lee Davidson of Visalia, California, a veteran of World War II 
and a hero of our community.
  Howard was born in Visalia, California on April 2, 1925. With the 
entry of the United States into World War II, he proudly enlisted in 
the U.S. Army as Private First-Class Howard Lee Davidson. Howard would 
soon brave the treacherous Atlantic Ocean aboard the RMS Queen Mary 
vessel to join the war in Europe. On June 12, 1944, six days after the 
Normandy landings on D-Day, Howard was assigned to the U.S. Third Army, 
commanded by legendary General George Patton. During this time, Howard 
served as an anti-aircraft gunner in which he was part of the offensive 
across France, Belgium, and all the way into Germany. While advancing 
through the Ardennes Forest centered around Belgium and Luxembourg, 
Howard found himself in the Battle of the Bulge. Often referred to as 
``the greatest American battle of the war,&#x27;&#x27; Howard fought alongside 
British, French, and Canadian Allied forces to halt the final offensive 
of German reserves during a six-week winter onslaught. Without the 
bravery of Howard and others like him in the Third Army, the Allied 
offensive to liberate Europe would certainly have suffered deeply.
  When he returned to the United States after serving in the war, 
Howard met his wife Stella Thrasher and the two were soon married. The 
couple had three children--Kenny, Danny, and Vicky, who is Howard&#x27;s 
loving caretaker. Howard&#x27;s grandson, also named Danny, followed his 
grandfather&#x27;s dedication to patriotism and currently serves as Staff 
Sergeant at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. In our country&#x27;s proud 
history, it is so often the legacy of service among families which 
keeps our Nation safe and our Armed Forces strong. I hope Howard looks 
back with pride on his years of service, not only for the great 
sacrifices and honor, but also the enduring legacy it fosters for our 
Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I ask my colleagues here 
in Congress to join me in celebrating 100 years of Howard Lee 
Davidson&#x27;s brave and patriotic life.

                          ____________________

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BILL HUIZENGA

                        Wednesday, April 2, 2025

  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate 
Jaqua Realtors as they celebrate their 50th anniversary. This 
achievement represents more than a half-century of service to the 
people of Southwest Michigan.
  In 1975, Jaqua Realtors began with a single office in Kalamazoo 
operated by Chuck Jaqua. Since the doors first opened, Jaqua has opened 
thirteen more offices across Southwest Michigan. As a small business 
owner myself, I can attest that the hard work and dedication of the 
whole Jaqua family is a true representation of the American Dream. 
Marking half a century as a family-owned business. Since their 
founding, ownership has remained in the family. The business is 
currently under the leadership of Dan Jaqua, who sees the value of 
maintaining his late father&#x27;s commitment to the community.
  Jaqua Realtors is a prominent piece of the Southwest Michigan 
community. They believe in a hands-on approach to community support and 
have been extensively philanthropic since their foundation. Jaqua 
Realtors has contributed to groups such as the Kalamazoo Literary 
Council, Girls on the Run, and the Greater Kalamazoo United Way.
  We would like to thank Jaqua Realtors for more than fifty years of 
outstanding dedication in Southwest Michigan. This achievement is truly 
remarkable.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Jaqua Realtors as they 
celebrate their 50th anniversary.

          RECOGNIZING APRIL AS NATIONAL AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. CLAUDIA TENNEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, April 2, 2025

  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize April as 
``National Autism Awareness Month&#x27;&#x27;.
  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that 
generally appears before the age of 3, impacting social interaction, 
communication skills, and cognitive function. Today, 1 in 36 children 
in the United States are diagnosed with autism, and approximately 5.4 
million Americans are living with autism spectrum disorder.
  Autism prevalence has increased significantly over the past two 
decades, underscoring the need to expand research and provide adequate 
resources for individuals on the spectrum. By raising awareness, we can 
better support individuals and families affected by autism, helping 
them lead fulfilling lives.
  Our schools and early childcare programs must be equipped with the 
knowledge, resources, and training to assist those living with autism. 
Early diagnosis and intervention are critical, as they can 
significantly improve communication, social skills, and quality of life 
for individuals with autism.
  I would also like to take a moment to recognize my friend, Vincent 
McLaughlin, a dedicated advocate and a true inspiration. Vincent has 
shown unwavering commitment to his community through his decade-long 
service on the Ulster County Planning Board representing the Village of 
Saugerties, his 16 years of service as a volunteer firefighter, and his 
continuous work to raise awareness and support for those living with 
autism. In 2023, he was appointed to the New York State Council on 
Developmental Disabilities because of his advocacy and dedication, 
which embody the spirit of community involvement and empowerment.
  Vincent&#x27;s selfless efforts make a difference every day, and I am 
grateful for his dedication and friendship.
  As we observe Autism Awareness Month, let us commit to supporting all 
Americans living with autism, ensuring they receive the necessary 
resources, opportunities, and respect they deserve. Autism should never 
be a barrier to success or happiness.

                        Wednesday, April 2, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and enduring 
legacy of Patricia Marie Farris, a caring mother, grandmother, great-
grandmother, and entrepreneur who dedicated her career to our 
communities. Patricia passed away March 5, 2025, at the age of 94.
  Born on April 29, 1930, in Blue Eye, Arkansas, Patricia moved west in 
1941 during the Dust Bowl and was raised in the Indian Wells Valley of 
California. Through the Great Depression and World War II, Patricia 
grew up alongside her six siblings and parents. Together, they became 
one of the first families to put roots down in the area prior to the 
establishment of the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, home of the 
U.S. Navy&#x27;s premier weapons development program. Following her 
graduation from Burroughs High School, Patricia attended college in 
Missouri, where she would meet her husband, Fred Stanley Farris. They 
soon fell in love and were married on December 1, 1948.
  In 1969, Patricia and Fred Farris returned to the Indian Wells Valley 
with their children, after spending years living around the country. 
Patricia Farris, alongside her husband, managed a service station and 
cafe within the town of Inyokern, and worked many community events such 
as air shows and parades. For decades, she successfully contributed to 
community events and productions while simultaneously managing the 
family-run businesses. In 1980, Patricia was hired as publisher for the 
News Review, a local newspaper that informed thousands of community 
members on events effecting the Indian Wells Valley. It was in this 
role that Patricia became a strong advocate and voice for the Indian 
Wells Valley. Always seeking to keep her community and its leaders 
aware of important stories and events, Patricia served in this role for 
44 years, until retiring in 2024.

                       SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS

  Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 
4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized 
schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees, 
subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference. This 
title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate 
Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place and 
purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or 
changes in the meetings as they occur.
  As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this 
information, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this 
information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the 
Congressional Record on Monday and Wednesday of each week.
  Meetings scheduled for Thursday, April 3, 2025 may be found in the 
Daily Digest of today&#x27;s Record.
