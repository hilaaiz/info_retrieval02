                       LETTER TO CORSICANA, TEXAS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JAKE ELLZEY

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Saturday, September 30, 2023

  Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record the 
following letter to honor the people of Corsicana, Texas and to 
celebrate its 175th Anniversary:

       Hello from the year 2023!
       My name is Jake Ellzey, and I currently serve as the 
     Congressman for Corsicana for the 118th Congress. I am 
     honored to represent this great city and to help celebrate 
     the 175th birthday of Corsicana. Corsicana was founded in 
     1848, and in the 175 years since its founding, so much has 
     changed, but the one thing that has always remained is the 
     good people who call this town their home.
       Now, I can&#x27;t tell you much about what happened in Corsicana 
     in 1848, but I can give you a little insight into what it 
     looks like today in 2023.
       Corsicana is a small town in Navarro County with 26,000 
     folks and a beautiful courthouse right in the middle. It&#x27;s 
     home to great restaurants like The Across the Street Diner 
     and Old Mexican Inn. The community has thriving businesses, 
     like Collins Street Bakery, Oil City Iron Works, and 
     Gilfillan&#x27;s Hardware. The people here are proud to support 
     the Corsicana Tigers and the Navarro College Bulldogs. In 
     2023, life is pretty good in Corsicana and Navarro County. 
     It&#x27;s a community that works together. It&#x27;s a community that 
     worships together. It&#x27;s a community that prays together.
       I am sure much has probably happened since 2023 for y&#x27;all, 
     but I know one thing that hasn&#x27;t changed is our pride for the 
     state of Texas and the great town of Corsicana. The community 
     of Corsicana has always been strong, and I have no doubt that 
     that has held true through the years. As y&#x27;all celebrate this 
     day, reflect on the strength of this city and our Nation. I 
     don&#x27;t know what is happening in the country, but I know there 
     is nothing our nation and the people of Texas cannot handle. 
     I am proud to be the Representative for Corsicana in 2023, 
     and I send well wishes to all of the Corsicana residents 
     past, present, and future.
       God Bless Corsicana and God Bless the United States.
