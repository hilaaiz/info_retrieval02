CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MU LAMBDA CHAPTER OF ALPHA PHI 
                            ALPHA FRATERNITY

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 19, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor the 100th 
anniversary of the chartering of the Mu Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi 
Alpha Fraternity, the eleventh alumni chapter of the first 
intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity established for African 
Americans.
  The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity was founded on December 4, 1906, by 7 
young African American men, known as the Seven Jewels, at Cornell 
University in Ithaca, New York. The founders of the fraternity--Henry 
Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George 
Biddle Kelley, Nathaniel Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle and Vertner 
Woodson Tandy--recognized the need for a strong bond of brotherhood 
among African Africans.
  The Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity is the largest predominantly African 
American intercollegiate fraternity and 1 of the 10 largest 
intercollegiate fraternities in the Nation, with more than 850 chapters 
around the world. The fraternity is led by General President Dr. Willis 
L. Lonzer, III, Interim Executive Director Sean L. McCaskill, 
Comptroller Donald E. Jackson and General Treasurer Densel Fleming. Its 
Eastern Region and Mid-Atlantic Association of Alpha Chapters are led 
by Regional Vice President East Christopher G. Ellis, Jr., Regional 
Assistant Vice President East Tamir D. Harper, District VI Director Ray 
Hawkins, Jr., Assistant District VI Director Noah Absalon, and Area 
Director Michael Taylor.
  The Mu Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity was established 
as the first alumni chapter in the District of Columbia on October 1, 
1923, in response to the desire of graduate members, many of whom were 
initiated into the Beta Chapter at Howard University, to give aid to 
the undergraduate members and continue the work of the fraternity after 
graduation.
  The Mu Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity established the 
Mu Lambda Foundation in 1994 expressly to provide community service to 
residents of the District of Columbia and to inspire and assist today&#x27;s 
youth in their quest to make their mark on society. For 100 years, the 
Mu Lambda Chapter has played a role in the positive development of the 
character and education of men. Six members of the Mu Lambda Chapter 
have served as the General President of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, 
Inc. and two have served as the Eastern Region Vice President. Members 
of the Mu Lambda Chapter are leaders in the areas of government, 
business, entertainment, philanthropy, law, non-profit, science, 
sports, literature, armed services, religion and academia.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in 
commending the members of the Mu Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, 
past and present, for their bond of friendship, common ideals and 
beliefs, and service to their community and in expressing our best 
wishes for the Mu Lambda Chapter&#x27;s continued growth and success.

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Village of 
Capron, Illinois, for celebrating their 150th anniversary.
  On December 3, 1873, the Village of Capron was established in Boone 
County, Illinois. The Village of Capron was named after Colonel Capron 
who purchased the land from Nancy Scott and Nathan H. Wooster served as 
the village&#x27;s first president. Today, the village serves as the third 
largest municipality in Boone County with a population of 1,400 
residents.
  The village celebrated significant achievements throughout its 
history, such as the drilling of its first municipal well in 1881, the 
building of its original water tower in 1900, and electricity coming to 
the village in 1911. We are grateful for Capron&#x27;s commitment and 
investment in agriculture and business development in northern 
Illinois.
  The Village of Capron is known throughout northern Illinois for the 
services that it has provided for the community over the last 150 
years. Today, we celebrate the village and their residents for their 
dedication to their community. I extend my sincere congratulations to 
the Village of Capron, Illinois for a successful 150 years, and I wish 
them even more success going forward.

                          ____________________

HONORING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JOHNNY APPLESEED ARTS AND CULTURAL 
                 FESTIVAL IN LEOMINSTER, MASSACHUSETTS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 19, 2023

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 30th 
anniversary of the Johnny Appleseed Arts and Cultural Festival in 
Leominster, Massachusetts on Saturday, September 23, 2023.
  While many have heard the tales of Johnny Appleseed--the American 
folk hero who wandered our early Nation planting apple seeds--not many 
know the man behind the story.
  John Chapman was born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1774. From a 
young age, his father taught him to cultivate trees. That&#x27;s where his 
story starts.
  Back then, frontier law allowed anyone to earn a claim to the land by 
developing a permanent homestead on it. Chapman established his 
homesteads by planting apple orchards, just like his father. He 
ventured more than 100,000 square miles from Massachusetts to Illinois, 
all the while planting apple seeds in his wake. At the time of his 
death in 1845, John Chapman owned over 1,200 acres of land, leaving 
behind hundreds of apple trees.
  Every year since 1993, thousands of people have gathered in 
Leominster to celebrate the life and work of John Chapman. Through live 
music and apple crisp, the festival aims to honor Chapman&#x27;s legacy of 
abundance, bravery, and cultivation.
  Mr. Speaker, this year is special. Under the dedication and expertise 
of Festival Coordinator Rick Marchand, the event has blossomed year 
after year. This year, the festival will provide 1,000 complimentary 
meals to children and their families, accommodate 230 local vendors, 
and welcome several dozens of organizations and artists to interface 
with their community. The Johnny Appleseed Arts and Cultural Festival 
is a chance to celebrate our rich land across generations.
  Mr. Speaker, Johnny Appleseed is a treasured National figure that we 
in Central Massachusetts are proud to share. I commend the Johnny 
Appleseed Festival on its 30th anniversary and am proud of the staff, 
volunteers, and community members that work to make this such a beloved 
annual event. We look forward to welcoming tens of thousands of 
neighbors to this beloved festival.

valiant military service during the Vietnam War. Following in his WWII

previously spent months in service off the coast of Vietnam.
  After 3 years of distinguished military service, he was discharged 
from Active Duty in November of 1968. He is proud to share that his 
grandson continues the family tradition of military service in support 
of our country.
  Please join me in celebrating Electrician&#x27;s Mate 3rd Class Alan 
Danculovich for his distinguished military service to the United States

                      Tuesday, September 19, 2023

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pastor Chuck Horner of 
Calvary Baptist Church in Hayward for his service to the community for 
over 30 years.
  Chuck graduated from Woodlawn High School in 1969, then enlisting in 
the United States Navy serving as an Anti-Submarine Warfare Operator 
from 1970 to 1974 in Coronado, California.
  Upon discharge, Chuck enrolled at the California Baptist University, 
earning a Bachelor of Arts in Religion and Behavioral Science in 1978. 
He later returned to school to earn a Master of Divinity in Theology 
from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary.
  In October 1990, Chuck moved to Hayward from Dixon, California, to 
become the Senior Pastor of Calvary Baptist Church. Through his role, 
he profoundly contributed to the faith community within Hayward and the 
East Bay at large. In fact, I fondly remember walking with Chuck 
through Hayward to deliver prepared Thanksgiving meals to the homeless, 
something he loved doing every year.
  Chuck is heavily involved in community service programs. As Chair of 
the Clean &amp; Green Task Force, Chuck worked to improve

[[Page E862]]

the city of Hayward by reducing graffiti vandalism. When graffiti 
taggers were caught, Chuck offered to mentor and help them change 
course to prevent property vandalism. Chuck also founded HayWallKru in 
2010, empowering graffiti taggers to become artists through abatement, 
education, and additional development opportunities.
  Chuck served in the community through his various roles in other 
community service organizations, such as director of the Hayward 
Coalition for Healthy Youth, the Ashland Cherryland Health Community 
Coalition, the Hayward Rotary Club, the Salvation Army Meal Project 
Coordinator, Vice President of the Hayward Education Foundation, and an 
Ambassador for the Hayward Chamber of Commerce.
  Chuck has been a beloved member of the Hayward community for over 30 
years, and known as the big guy with a booming voice, and a personality 
to match. Chuck has battled prostate cancer for ten years while 
remaining involved in various outreach roles and has recently started 
hospice care.
  I join the Hayward community in recognizing the contributions of 
Pastor Chuck and send my sincerest well wishes to Linda, his wife of 
over 50 years, and their two children, Christal and Aaron.

  RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY&#x27;&#x27; SCOTT

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 19, 2023

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge that 
20 years ago, on September 4, 2003, President George W. Bush signed the 
Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, into law. This law recognized the 
difficult truth of rampant and completely unacceptable sexual abuse of 
people in our jails, prisons, and juvenile detention facilities, and 
endeavored to address it. PREA sought to end these abuses by creating 
research mandates, promulgating National standards, and providing grant 
funding to meet those standards.
  Ending prisoner rape remains one of the increasingly rare topics on 
which people on both sides of the aisle can continue to agree. I joined 
forces with my Virginia colleague, Congressman Frank Wolf, to sponsor 
the bill in this chamber, and Senators Ted Kennedy and Jeff Sessions 
sponsored PREA in the Senate. PREA passed with unanimous support in 
both the House and Senate. Fighting against institutional abuse and 
protecting those who cannot advocate for themselves should never be a 
partisan issue, and I have been gratified by the coalition of support 
PREA has inspired over the years.
  Since PREA&#x27;s passage, we&#x27;ve seen dramatic improvements in how adults 
and children in detention are treated. Thousands of corrections 
professionals have been hired and trained to ensure the safety of 
people in their custody through the implementation of PREA&#x27;s National 
standards. The U.S. Department of Justice is now required to gather 
data on sexual abuse in custody that provides corrections facilities, 
advocates and policymakers with invaluable information on the dynamics 
of sexual abuse in detention, and how it can be stopped.
  Hundreds of thousands of incarcerated people are educated every year 
about their right

[[Page E863]]

to be safe and respected, and how to speak out if they are not. 
Incarcerated people, their families, and advocates now have more 
effective methods of reporting sexual abuse, as evidenced by the 
dramatic increase in the number of reports we have seen since PREA&#x27;s 
enactment. This is a clear sign that incarcerated survivors understand 
that people care about their experiences, that they have mechanisms to 
advocate for themselves, and that their voices should no longer go 
unheard. Through these efforts and sustained support for survivors, the 
stigma of reporting abuse has been steadily eroding since PREA&#x27;s 
passage.
  I also want to acknowledge the broad-based coalition of advocates and 
civil rights groups that fought to pass PREA, encourage corrections 
facilities to implement PREA&#x27;s National standards, and continue to 
ensure that the law lives up to its intended purpose and promise. 
Specifically, people who have endured this abuse have been on the front 
lines of the effort to make our prisons and jails places where people 
are free of sexual abuse. Just Detention International&#x27;s Survivor 
Council deserves special mention. These courageous survivors have 
fought tirelessly to ensure that no one ever has to face abuse and to 
instill in all of us the principle that no matter what crime a person 
has committed, rape is not part of the penalty.
  The work we set out to do with PREA is by no means over. Rape in 
prisons is still far too common. And young people, LGBTQ+ individuals, 
immigrants, and people who come from communities of color are more 
affected by this crisis than others. The recent cases of staff sexual 
abuse in California at the Federal Correctional Institution Dublin 
(FCI-Dublin) at the highest levels expose and illustrate the impunity 
with which many staff perpetrators still operate. Making things worse, 
the dozens of women at FCI-Dublin who were abused could not initially 
get support services. This highlights a larger problem of a lack of 
resources for community service providers.
  Prisons, jails, and youth detention facilities nationwide must commit 
to implementing the National Prison Rape Elimination Act standards. 
This doesn&#x27;t mean merely changing policies as they&#x27;re written on paper. 
It means meaningfully adopting those policies and shifting the culture 
on the ground in detention facilities. This encompasses everything from 
safer reporting procedures for survivors to stronger investigations 
after an assault occurs. We must empower staff to identify signs that 
incarcerated people are being abused, and to identify red flags in 
staff behavior that could result in abuse. We must also have more 
confidential emotional support services in prisons, especially from 
community providers, so that survivors can get the help they deserve. 
And finally, we must end the culture of impunity and the code of 
silence among staff which allows abuse to flourish. As I have before, I 
call on the Department of Justice to work vigorously to ensure that 
every state implements PREA to protect all inmates from sexual 
violence.
  Mr. Speaker, on the 20th anniversary of its enactment, let us take 
this moment to recognize the ways that PREA marked an important shift 
in how we, as a country, deal with this violence. Sexual abuse in 
detention may not be a secret epidemic anymore, but it is incumbent 
upon us to actualize the goal set out in this historic law and end this 
crisis, once and for all. Let me say again: rape is not part of the 
penalty.

  RECOGNIZING TIMOTHY D. ARMOUR FOR WORKING TO IMPROVE PEOPLE&#x27;S LIVES 
                      THROUGH SUCCESSFUL INVESTING

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRAD SHERMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 19, 2023

  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Capital Group 
and one of its retiring leaders, Mr. Timothy D. Armour. Capital Group 
is not only headquartered, but was also founded more than 90 years ago, 
in my hometown of Los Angeles. Today, I want to recognize Tim for his 
contributions to the field of asset management and his dedication to 
the tens of millions of investors in the United States and around the 
world who have entrusted Capital Group to safeguard and grow their 
savings.
  At the end of this year, Tim will retire from Capital Group, a firm 
he joined over 40 years ago at its Los Angeles headquarters. After 
graduating from the firm&#x27;s early-career rotational program, he served 
as an investment research analyst covering telecommunications and U.S. 
service companies and later as a portfolio manager in several of the 
American Funds. He distinguished himself throughout his career as a 
savvy investor able to identify companies that deliver long-term value 
for their shareholders.
  Tim also served in various leadership roles, including as Chairman of 
Capital Group&#x27;s Management Committee and Board of Directors over the 
past 8 years. Under his leadership, the 92-year old firm expanded its 
reach to global investors while evolving to meet the demands of a 
changing world and provide for future success for the benefit of 
Capital Group&#x27;s clients, associates and the communities where those 
associates live and work.
  Tim has been regarded by his colleagues and peers within the 
financial services industry as the embodiment of Capital Group&#x27;s core 
values. His personal integrity, long-term focus and commitment to 
clients have set the tone for the current generation of the firm&#x27;s 
associates and created a legacy that the next generation can follow.
  In anticipation of his retirement at the end of this year, associates 
of Capital Group were asked to characterize Tim&#x27;s leadership with just 
a single word. The words most often repeated included kind, trusted, 
candid, inclusive, present, and caring. One close colleague added, ``It 
is rare to find a leader who cares so genuinely and openly about his 
colleagues and clients.&#x27;&#x27; I am proud to celebrate the career 
accomplishment of Tim Armour and wish him all the very best in life&#x27;s 
next chapter.

                       REMEMBERING FRANK BARRIOS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RUBEN GALLEGO

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 19, 2023

  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and 
mourn the loss of Frank Barrios, a third generation Arizonan and proud 
Mexican American who dedicated over 50 years of service to the people 
of Arizona. I want to express my gratitude for Frank&#x27;s remarkable 
service to the 3rd Congressional District, to our community, and to all 
of Arizona.
  Frank spent his career in hydrology, utilizing his engineering degree 
to ensure the sustainability of Arizona&#x27;s water supply. Without these 
efforts, Arizona&#x27;s growth and success over the past decades would not 
have been possible. He began his career with the U.S. Bureau of 
Reclamation. From there, he transitioned to the Arizona Water 
Commission, later called the Arizona Department of Water Resources, 
serving as a director for both the Pinal and Phoenix Active Management 
Areas. After retiring from Colorado River Planning in 1998, Frank was 
appointed to the Central Arizona Water Conservation District Board of 
Directors, where he served for 3 years.
  But Frank&#x27;s impact and his legacy go far beyond his career. Frank 
served as President of 7 boards, won numerous awards and accolades, and 
published several books. He was passionate about preserving the history 
of Mexican Americans in the Valley, fighting to restore a historically 
Latino burial ground in downtown Phoenix and archiving photographs and 
stories. Thanks to his work, the contributions of Latinos to Arizona 
history will not be erased.
  My thoughts are with Frank&#x27;s family and friends during this difficult 
time. Although he will be greatly missed, his legacy will be carried on 
through the countless lives he touched in his decades of service to the 
people of Arizona.
