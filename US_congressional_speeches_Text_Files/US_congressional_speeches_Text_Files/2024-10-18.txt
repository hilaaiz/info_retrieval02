                     CELEBRATING DETROIT CHINA DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 18, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 8th annual 
Chinese American Culture and Arts Festival for Detroit China Day. This 
year also marks the 45th anniversary of the normalization of U.S.-China 
relations, a time to recognize the cultural and economic contributions 
of Chinese Americans to Michigan. Detroit China Day, which allows the 
community to experience the richness of Chinese culture and to build 
stronger ties with members of our community, is worthy of commendation.
  Michigan&#x27;s 6th Congressional District is home to one of the largest 
concentrations of Chinese Americans in the Midwest. In these 
challenging times, when our Nation faces divisions that may seem 
insurmountable, it is essential to embrace and celebrate our diversity. 
This festival is a testament to the power of unity among different 
cultures through showcasing Chinese performances, fashion shows, live 
paintings, food and tea tastings, and more. By sharing and educating 
our fellow community members on our stories, traditions, and art, we 
can bridge divides and cultivate understanding to strengthen the bonds 
that connect us all.
  This year marks the 45th anniversary of the normalization of U.S.-
China relations and provides a fitting opportunity to reflect on the 
contributions of Chinese Americans to our community, state, and Nation. 
Their entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, and hard work have been 
pivotal in driving economic growth and fostering a thriving business 
environment. Chinese American professionals and entrepreneurs have left 
an indelible mark on our economic landscape, demonstrating resilience, 
creativity, and leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
8th annual Chinese American Culture and Arts Festival for Detroit China 
Day and the 45th anniversary of the normalization of U.S.-China 
relations. For the last eight years, this festival has been monumental 
in cultivating a deeper appreciation for

[[Page E1048]]

the ways in which Chinese culture has enhanced the American way of 
life, celebrating decades of contributions to Michigan&#x27;s communities 
and economy. I thank Detroit and its community members for their 
commitment to hosting the Chinese American Culture and Arts Festival, 
and we are excited to see how the festival will continue to educate and 
unite the community.

                        Friday, October 18, 2024

  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 100th birthday of 
Sara Denton, a close friend and trailblazer in Nevada politics. Sara 
Pittard Denton was born on November 12, 1924, in Paducah, Kentucky.
  In 1943, during her first year in college at Southern Illinois 
University, the U.S. Army Signal Corps, the forerunner to Military 
Intelligence, recruited her to work as a ``Code Girl&#x27;&#x27; in Washington, 
D.C. at the height of World War II. There she met Ralph Denton, a young 
U.S. Army lieutenant from Caliente, Nevada, who was attending law 
school under the patronage of U.S. Senator Pat McCarran. They married 
in 1949 and after Ralph&#x27;s graduation, the newlyweds moved to Nevada 
where for 75 years Sara volunteered in numerous state and national 
political campaigns while also rearing their three children: renown 
author Sally, Dr. Scott Denton, and Judge Mark Denton.
  Following her participation in U.S. Senator Howard Cannon&#x27;s 
successful 1976 campaign, Sara was hired as his Administrative 
Assistant, her first and only paid position in Nevada politics.
  In recent decades, Sara has been instrumental in other Nevada 
campaigns, including presidential candidates Bill Clinton, Barack 
Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris. In addition to 
her political work, Sara has been involved in numerous community and 
charitable organizations, including the 1964 founding of Boulder City&#x27;s 
Art in the Park, the largest juried art festival in the Southwest with 
proceeds going towards the Boulder City Hospital Foundation.
  The State of Nevada has benefitted tremendously from her work. She is 
greatly respected, highly admired, and deeply loved by so many. I join 
my fellow Nevadans in wishing her a Happy One-Hundredth Birthday.

                        Friday, October 18, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
Calistoga Library, as it celebrates its 100th year in service to the 
Calistoga community.
  The Calistoga Library has consistently provided our community with 
education and entertainment catered to all ages, but most important for 
our youth. The library&#x27;s role of informing children in fun and 
innovative ways has continually inspired a love for learning from one 
generation to the next. Cultivating a safe environment for individuals 
who seek knowledge, Calistoga&#x27;s library contributes to the lifelong 
passion for learning that so many of us hold dear.
  The Calistoga Library has a rich history in our community. The 
library traces its origins back to the 1880s, when the property was 
rented for just $3.00 a month. Thanks to the early 20th century efforts 
of the Calistoga Civics Club, which fundraised for a permanent building 
to be established for the library, the building we know today as the 
Calistoga Library was completed in 1924 for $20,000.
  Decades of hard work by library staff have seen the library grow from 
the once rented room above the police station with a handful of 
paperbacks, to a community center that distributes games, puzzles, and 
e-books. The library&#x27;s services, such as rentals and publicly 
accessible computers, have adapted with the ever-changing technological 
advancements of the modern era, displaying the dynamic nature and 
dedication of countless employees over the years.
  In addition to offering an outstanding variety of materials to the 
people of Calistoga, the library has partnered with public and private 
agencies to assist in improving lives and the quality of our community. 
In collaborating with schools, government agencies, and numerous local 
businesses over the years, the library has acted as a forum for events 
that the whole town enjoys. The past 100 years have tested the 
resilience of Calistoga: wildfires, social unrest, even pandemics. With 
the help of incredible institutions such as the library, our town has 
navigated one crisis after another and remains stronger than ever.
  Mr. Speaker, the Calistoga Library has evolved from small beginnings 
into a beloved institution deserving of our recognition for its 100 
years of service to all whom love to learn. Over the decades, the 
building and organization has become a staple of our town. Years of 
quality service to our community have embedded the library as a core 
aspect of the town. Without it, Calistoga would not be the same. As 
such, it is fitting and proper that it be honored on this terrific 
anniversary as we look forward to the next 100 years of meaningful 
education and civil service.

  Mr. BURLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and 
legacy of Mr. Sam Hamra of Springfield, Missouri. He was 92 years old 
when he recently passed away.
  Mr. Hamra was the founder and chairman of Hamra Enterprises, which

and law degrees. He served as an officer in the U.S. Army, where he was 
appointed as U.S. Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army for 
Western Missouri. He later served as the attorney for the city of Nixa, 
Missouri, where he helped build the city&#x27;s electric distribution 
system. He also advocated for funding to expand transportation arteries 
connecting Branson to Springfield, as well as expanding a major 
thoroughfare in the city of Springfield.
  Mr. Hamra was active in his community. He was a founding member of 
OakStar Bank, charter president of the Rotary Club of Springfield 
Southeast, and a member of the foundation board for Ozarks Technical 
Community College, which also houses the Sam and June Hamra Family 
Library. The Sam F. Hamra Center for Justice also was named for his 
work organizing and serving as the first board chairman of Legal 
Services of Southern Missouri, which serves 43 southern Missouri 
counties. He and his wife, June, also donated the funds to purchase the 
land for the Kitchen Homeless Family Shelter on the O&#x27;Reilly Campus.
  Sam Hamra was a community builder who made an impact on so many 
aspects of Springfield. He will be greatly missed, but his legacy will 
live on.

                        Friday, October 18, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Napa 
County Hispanic Network for the occasion of their 40th anniversary.
  As the oldest Latino nonprofit organization in Napa County, the Napa 
County Hispanic Network seeks to develop the Napa County Latino 
community through political and economic empowerment, pursuit of 
education, and social advocacy. The network was established in 1983 by 
a group of local professionals seeing a gap in access to services for 
the Spanish-speaking community. In addition to emphasizing 
collaboration, voluntary civil service, and the value of cultural 
heritage for Latino communities, the network raises critical funds for 
Napa County students in their pursuit of higher education.
  With a mission of closing the opportunity gap for Napa County&#x27;s 
Latino students financial needs, the Napa County Hispanic Network has 
worked tirelessly to increase access to financial support and 
scholarship services for graduating high school students in our 
district. Since its founding, the network has distributed over $500,000 
of academic scholarships to more than 700 Napa County students, with 
the organization increasing their annual impact each year.
  Higher education in the United States has always been heralded as the 
road to career success and fulfillment for our children. By providing 
students from our county with scholarship funds that empower that 
pathway, the network has performed an incredible service to our 
community.
  In 2024, the Napa County Hispanic Network awarded $41,000 in the form 
of $1,000 to $2,500 scholarships through seven different programs, the 
largest contributions for a single year to date. As college costs have 
risen over the years, the network has increased its level of support to 
help parents navigate the growing financial challenges of sending their 
children to college and university. The impact of assisting children&#x27;s 
journeys through education will benefit students and their families for 
generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, through academic scholarships and community 
contributions, the Napa County Hispanic Network has spent an impactful 
40 years striving to cultivate the next generation of Latino community 
leaders in Napa County. This invaluable mission is central to the 
health and preservation of our community, as well as the prosperity of 
our children. For the terrific work the network has done, we honor them 
here today.

ACHIEVEMENT IN ADVOCACY AWARD FROM THE HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION OF HAWAII

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 18, 2024

  Ms. TOKUDA. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to recognize 
Speaker Scott Saiki of the Hawaii State House of Representatives, a 
distinguished legislator and this year&#x27;s recipient of the Achievement 
in Advocacy award from the Healthcare Association of Hawaii.
  Throughout his 20 years in the Hawaii State Legislature, Speaker 
Saiki has championed access to care, especially for the underserved and 
most vulnerable in Hawaii. His commitment to care included support for 
innovative ideas to grow our healthcare workforce, training local 
talent for critical positions. Never one to shy away from difficult 
issues, he also led efforts to give our families the power to make some 
of the most personal decisions in their lifetimes.
  As Speaker of the Hawaii House of Representatives, he also helped 
lead Hawaii through a global pandemic. His work was instrumental in 
protecting residents by setting up vaccination sites, testing, and 
metrics for the eventual reopening of our State. His leadership, 
including in spearheading the House Select Committee on COVID-19 
Economic and Financial Preparedness, ensured our State could 
successfully make it through a worldwide public health emergency.
  Speaker Saiki&#x27;s unflagging dedication and commitment to others is an 
inspiration to many, and I am pleased to join the Healthcare 
Association of Hawaii in celebrating his many accomplishments. 
Congratulations and mahalo to Speaker Saiki for all his contributions 
to the people and the State of Hawaii.

                          ____________________

  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to recognize public 
servant and owner of local restaurant Captain Keno&#x27;s, Gerry Sova from 
Encinitas, as my Constituent of the Month for July 2024.
  Mr. Sova is a generous local leader who has dedicated his life to 
making his fellow community members feel accepted. For the past 54 
years, Gerry has worked to ensure that Captain Keno&#x27;s could accommodate 
anyone who wanted a safe space to eat, drink, and simply feel welcome.
  Over the years, Mr. Sova has fed thousands of local firefighters, 
nonprofit groups, and customers during special holiday meals--
regardless of whether they could afford to pay or not.
  With Captain Keno&#x27;s set to permanently close at the end of August, it 
is my honor to recognize Gerry for his selfless dedication to giving 
back to others. He is an inspiring member of our community whose work 
and commitment over the past five decades is truly admirable, and I&#x27;m
