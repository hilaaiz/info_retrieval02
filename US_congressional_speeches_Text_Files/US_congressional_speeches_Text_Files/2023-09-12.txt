            COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF THOMAS ROY BIRKENSTOCK

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. PAT FALLON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and 
service of Mr. Thomas ``Tom&#x27;&#x27; Roy Birkenstock of Burlington, Iowa, who 
passed away on August 15, 2023.
  Mr. Birkenstock was born on July 16, 1944, in Burlington, Iowa to Roy 
George and Marjorie Maude Holsteen Birkenstock. A lifelong farmer, he 
graduated from Iowa State University in 1966 with a degree in Animal 
Science. Mr. Birkenstock also served 6 years in the National Guard. He 
married Sue Ellen Maupin on February 26, 1966, and together, they have 
3 children and many more grandchildren.
  Those who knew Mr. Birkenstock will tell you that he was always 
generous and kind. He never knew a stranger, and happily engaged every 
individual he met. Mr. Birkenstock always put family first and 
committed much of his time to his grandchildren. In his free time, Mr. 
Birkenstock was passionate about golfing, woodworking, hunting, 
fishing, and sports; he was a loud and proud supporter of the Iowa 
Hawkeyes, Green Bay Packers, and the St. Louis Cardinals. A devoted man 
of faith, Mr. Birkenstock was a longtime member of the Knights of 
Columbus fraternal organization and St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in 
Dodgeville, where he served on the church council and taught Sunday 
School. His generosity and contributions towards his local community 
were unmatched and will be remembered for many years to come.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol to recognize Mr. Birkenstock&#x27;s life and service to our Nation. 
He will be dearly missed by his friends, family, and all who knew him.

                          ____________________

                                 ______

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mister Speaker, I rise today along with 
my colleague Congressman Jared Huffman to honor Gaye Theresa LeBaron in 
celebration of her outstanding career as a journalist, teacher, author 
and historian.
  Born in the town of Scotia, California, in 1935, Mrs. LeBaron moved 
to Boyes Hots Springs in Sonoma County when she was 14 years old. She 
attended Santa Rosa Junior College before transferring to the 
University of California, Berkeley to pursue a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 
English and History.
  Her illustrious career as an historian and human-interest columnist 
at the Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, California, began in 1955 when she 
became an intern. During her 65 years with the Press Democrat as a 
reporter and later columnist, she wrote 8,500 columns, married her late 
husband John LeBaron and had her 2 children, Suzanne and Tony. Mrs. 
LeBaron has since gifted her research notes, correspondence, memoirs, 
unpublished documents, newspaper clippings and photographs to Sonoma 
State University. Students and the public enjoy access to the Gaye 
LeBaron Collection.
  Mrs. LeBaron has a deep love of Sonoma County history. She told our 
county&#x27;s story as a lecturer at the Santa Rosa Junior College for 35 
years as well as at Sonoma State University&#x27;s Osher Lifelong Learning 
Institute. She has written 3 books on the history of Santa Rosa: Santa 
Rosa: A Nineteenth Century Town, Santa Rosa: A Twentieth Century Town, 
and The Wonder Seekers of Fountaingrove. Mrs. LeBaron also served on 
the Sonoma County Museum Leadership Council, further dedicating herself 
to the history of Sonoma County. Now her permanent exhibit at the 
museum, Sonoma County Stories, will ensure future generations can 
experience her life&#x27;s work.
  Widely renowned in our community, Mrs. LeBaron received the 
Representative Mike Thompson Sonoma County Woman of the Year Award in 
2016, an Honorary Doctorate of Letters from Sonoma State University and 
a President&#x27;s Medallion from the Santa Rosa Junior College Foundation.
  Mr. Speaker, it is evident that Mrs. LeBaron has dedicated her life 
to the people of Sonoma County through her writing, teaching and 
service.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
50th anniversary landing of the first boat carrying Haitian refugees to 
South Florida.
  On December 12, 1972, the first report of Haitian refugees, often 
called ``Haitian Boat People,&#x27;&#x27; fleeing to the United States, was 
documented. Between 1972 and 1981, over 55,000 refugees arrived in 
Florida and have continued to thrive thanks to community champions who 
supported the Haitian migrant population.
  Today, the South Florida Haitian refugee population has accomplished 
many firsts, becoming mayors, councilmembers, and state 
representatives. Miami&#x27;s historic Lemon City became the first 
neighborhood officially called Little Haiti. Central streets were named 
after Haitian cultural icons such as Felix Morisseau-Leroy and heroes 
of Haiti&#x27;s independence. A statue of Toussaint Louverture stands guard 
on Plas Kamoken in Little Haiti. Toussaint Elementary was home to the 
first Haitian American principal, and Morningside Elementary

[[Page E834]]

became the first international language magnet in the country to offer 
Haitian Creole. The Little Haiti Cultural Center has become the mecca 
for the global Haitian Diaspora, a destination for arts, culture, and 
entertainment. And the Manno Sannon Stadium is home to the 
championship-winning Little Haiti Supreme Football Team.
  December 12, 2022, marked the 50th anniversary of the first 
documented arrival of Haitian refugees fleeing Haiti by sea. This 
anniversary marks the beginning of an incredible journey that has 
transformed South Florida&#x27;s social, cultural, and political landscape. 
History-making events have since followed, impacting federal 
jurisprudence, local advocacy efforts for immigrant justice, and the 
treatment of asylum seekers in healthcare, education, employment, and 
housing.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the legacy of the Haitian 
boat people.

      HONORING THE PROMOTORES Y PROMOTORAS OF LATINO HEALTH ACCESS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. J. LUIS CORREA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of 
Latino Health Access, an organization that works tirelessly to uplift 
communities, promote health equity, and create sustainable change.
  Latino Health Access (LHA) has demonstrated an unwavering commitment 
to these ideals through its mission, which partners with communities to 
aid through education, services, consciousness-raising, and civic 
participation.
  Latino Health Access&#x27;s mission is multifaceted, encompassing the 
delivery of culturally appropriate health-related services and 
programming to address pressing health concerns, as well as engaging 
individuals in low-income, low-opportunity areas to transform their 
environments and effect positive, concrete changes in their homes and 
communities.
  Since its establishment in 1993, Latino Health Access has been a 
trailblazer in the field of public health by pioneering the Promotor de 
Salud/Community Health Worker (CHW) model in the United States, 
recognizing the potential of individuals from within communities to 
advocate for better health and living conditions.
  The Promotores y Promotoras, who are integral to the Latino Health 
Access approach, are community members themselves, living within the 
very neighborhoods they serve, and are dedicated to promoting, 
connecting, and linking their communities with vital health services 
while also advocating at local, county, and state levels for policies 
that enhance overall living conditions.
  Today, equity lies at the heart of the Promotor Model, which 
contributes to building healthier and more resilient communities by 
providing systems navigation services, surmounting barriers to access, 
and amplifying community leadership and participation, while 
simultaneously advocating for policy, systems, and environmental 
changes that address the social determinants of health.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the profound impact of 
Latino Health Access and its Promoter Model.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON AN OPEN SOCIETY WITH 
                          SECURITY ACT OF 2023

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the United States 
Commission on an Open Society with Security Act of 2023, which would 
create a commission to investigate how we can maintain our democratic 
traditions while actively responding to the real and substantial 
threats posed by foreign and domestic terrorism.
  The impetus for this commission was the Oklahoma City bombing in 
1995, its importance grew after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
2001, and has reached peak urgency since the insurrectionist attack on 
the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The succession of tragic events 
endured by our Nation has led to a series of sweeping security 
increases that are deemed both necessary and temporary in the moment 
but create lasting security infrastructure that is difficult to 
dismantle and infringes on our open, democratic society.
  We must acknowledge and accept that we have entered an era of 
constant internal and external threats, requiring ever-higher levels of 
security for our people and public spaces. What we thought would be a 
temporary infringement on our open society has turned into a permanent 
restriction on how our citizens interact with each other and our 
democratic institutions. Because emergencies typically dictate security 
decisions, essential discussions on the proper balance between 
security, individual rights and the freedoms enjoyed in an open society 
have been repeatedly deferred.
  This bill would ensure that these long overdue discussions take place 
in a public forum with experts drawn from across the spectrum. To date, 
security planning has been delegated almost exclusively to security, 
intelligence and military experts. Although their input is 
indispensable, they cannot be expected to consider matters outside of 
their expertise. To strike a better balance that gives sufficient 
importance to our democratic traditions, we need to invite experts from 
diverse fields to the same table to work together. Therefore, the 
commission would be composed not only of security, intelligence and 
military experts, but also experts from such fields as business, 
architecture, technology, law, city planning, art, engineering, 
philosophy, history, sociology and psychology.
  We have used commissions before to deeply investigate and address 
unprecedented challenges, such as the National Commission on Terrorist 
Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 Commission), the 
Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States 
Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (also known as the Silberman Robb 
Commission) and the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders 
(also known as the Kerner Commission). The commission created by this 
bill would seek to avert a crisis in basic freedoms before their 
infringement becomes entrenched. We cannot allow security protocols to 
proliferate without informed civilian oversight and a thorough analysis 
of alternatives that might better safeguard freedom and commerce.
  Furthermore, we have had decades to develop security strategies and 
technologies that do not deprive our citizens of access to institutions 
and personal liberty. Thus far, we have either relied on imprecise, 
medieval approaches like crude barriers or on intrusive new 
technologies that treat privacy like a privilege instead of a right. We 
can, and must, do better.
  As the home of our federal government, the District of Columbia&#x27;s 
residents have suffered disproportionate infringement on public spaces, 
personal rights and freedoms in the name of security. Public spaces 
that serve as the heart of our local communities have become restricted 
zones characterized by a heavy security presence, with individuals 
liable to be reprimanded for walking on the wrong side of the street or 
marveling too long at the architecture. Barriers such as walls and 
fences are touted as essential security features while our citizens are 
left peering at their democracy from a distance.
  Security is not only about reducing lives lost and costs. It is also 
about safeguarding the institutions, freedoms and values that anchor 
our country, not only for ourselves but for future generations. The 
social compact between government and the people should not be the 
result of a series of hostage negotiations. We must resume reasoned and 
deliberative decision-making, beginning with a high-level commission 
composed of experts from diverse disciplines charged with developing a 
new course that will protect both our people and our precious 
democratic institutions and traditions.

  Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record 
remarks submitted at the request of a Virginia Beach constituent, Rabbi 
Dr. Israel Zoberman of Temple Lev Tikvah, and are a reflection of his 
views:


           RABBI ZOBERMAN&#x27;S POEM--JERUSALEM&#x27;S GOLDEN SILENCE

     These days there is a golden silence
     Overcoming the shouts of the prophets
     Of old and new, ``peace, peace&#x27;&#x27;
     And there is no peace
     But the silence of sealed echoes
     Of hope in holy crevices where
     Shalom&#x27;s doves find shelter at the
     Wall where wailing has not abated,
     The silence of the cloud of glory
     Encircling God&#x27;s city like an embracing
     Wedding canopy.
     The voice of the groom
     And the voice of the bride
     Whose rejoicing is Jerusalem&#x27;s signature,
     Are ever preserved under the heavy silence
     Of immovable rocks hiding millennial
     Prayers refusing to concede victory to
     A spirit bespeaking not the contrition
     Of sacrifice brought here from near
     And afar to placate the One
     Who only pardons those seeking
     The promising power of peace.

  Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman is founder and spiritual leader of Temple 
Lev Tikvah, and Honorary Senior Rabbi Scholar at Eastern Shore Chapel 
Episcopal, both in Virginia Beach. He is a member of the Virginia Beach 
Human Rights Commission.

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Lieutenant General Matthew G. Glavy, who serves his country with the 
pride and honor befitting the highest ranks of the United States Marine 
Corps.
  Born in 1963 at Mercy Hospital in Buffalo, New York, Lieutenant 
General Matthew Glavy grew up with his 3 siblings under the name 
``Jerry.&#x27;&#x27; Calling Western New York home, Lieutenant General Glavy 
finds comfort in Buffalo style wings, the Buffalo Bills, and the cold 
winter climate of Western New York. As a child, Lieutenant General 
Matthew Glavy was an avid sports fan, having played youth league 
football in his childhood, later lettering in cross country and track 
in high school before graduating in 1981.
  Lieutenant General Glavy exemplifies every aspect of courage, 
determination, and service denominated in the timeless motto of the 
Marine Corps, ``Semper Fi.&#x27;&#x27; having served in all 3 designations: the 
operating forces, the supporting establishment, and in the 
headquarters. As a member of the operating forces and supporting 
establishment, Lieutenant General Glavy served ``at the heart of the 
Marine Corps&#x27;&#x27; in various assignments, including as an aircraft 
maintenance officer, weapons and tactics officer and embark officer, 
and current operations officer, eventually climbing the ranks to 
commanding general and U.S. Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command and 
Space Command. General Glavy also supported his troops, his country, 
and his family, in the USMC Headquarters, where he served, among many 
impressive assignments, as platoon commander, White House liaison 
officer, and presidential command pilot. Lieutenant General Glavy 
currently serves as the Deputy Commandant for Information and 2nd 
Commander of the Marine Corps Forces Strategic Command. Lieutenant 
General Glavy will be returning to the Buffalo area as the keynote 
speaker at the reunion of the 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines.
  Today, I&#x27;m asking all present to join me in honoring Lieutenant 
General Matthew G. Glavy for his lengthy service and dedication to our 
great Nation.

     RECOGNIZING THE INDONESIAN COMMUNITY CONNECT FOR A DECADE OF 
                     CELEBRATING INDONESIAN CULTURE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHRIS PAPPAS

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Indonesian 
Community Connect in New Hampshire as they celebrate a decade of 
promoting Indonesian culture. This also marks the sixth anniversary of 
ICC&#x27;s initiatives as a non-profit organization and the second year of 
the momentum of the Little Indonesia Project. The Little Indonesia 
Project, the first of its kind in our Nation, embodies art, culture, 
and opportunity, forging connections between Indonesian culture and New 
Hampshire, directly contributing to the revitalization of the Downtown 
Somersworth business district.
  ICC, a non-profit organization headquartered in New Hampshire, has 
dedicated itself to showcasing the rich diversity of Indonesian culture 
while fostering mutual understanding among various cultures and values. 
Operating from Somersworth, NH, the ICC team has diligently linked the 
Indonesian community with the Granite State and its support services. 
They have gone the extra mile in assisting the Indonesian community 
with accessing local resources, including healthcare, education, food, 
festivals, and much more.

[[Page E832]]

  This team serves as a bridge that connects Indonesian culture with 
neighboring communities, offering a wide array of resources. They have 
established a food pantry to address food insecurity within the 
Indonesian Community and provide support for career building, 
particularly for those affected by the pandemic, thereby promoting 
economic mobility in New Hampshire. Additionally, they offer document 
translation services to help community members navigate in-person, 
virtual, and phone interactions, enhancing English language 
proficiency. The ICC is not only committed to sharing its culture 
externally but also nurturing cultural enrichment for children and 
serving as a hub of resources for stakeholders, including the local 
government and valued collaborators in Indonesia.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District I extend my warmest congratulations and heartfelt thanks to 
the passionate volunteers at ICC, both in New Hampshire and Indonesia 
for a decade of work that embodies the spirit of collaboration and 
teamwork that we deeply value in New Hampshire. I wholeheartedly 
appreciate the heartfelt work of this team in fostering the rich 
tapestry of Indonesian culture over the past 10 years. As the 
representative privileged to serve the home base of the Indonesian 
Community Connect in Congress, I eagerly anticipate witnessing the 
continued success of this celebration in the years to come.

                          ____________________

             RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF MARK GROZIO

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize 
Legislator Mark Grozio and his remarkable career in public service. As 
a lifelong resident, graduate of LaSalle High School, and graduate of 
Niagara County Community College, Mark has always been equipped with a 
deep-seated familiarity and knowledge of his community.
  His career as a county legislator was preceded by over 3 decades as a 
wireman and IBEW member. He graduated from apprenticeship school, and 
naturally, his predilection for leadership roles made him a good fit 
for serving as assistant business manager for over 10 years at IBEW 
Local 237. Mark served on the contract negotiation committee, executive 
board, and labor management committee. Needless to say, Legislator 
Grozio has long understood the value of labor unions and apprenticeship 
training. This experience served him well in the legislature while 
dealing with issues of economic development, infrastructure, and 
facilities. Through the years, Mark sought additional ways to enhance 
his community. He served on the Niagara Falls planning board, the 
Niagara Falls electrical board, and volunteers for the festival of 
lights and Veterans Memorial at Hyde Park in Niagara Falls. He has 
worked with United Way, coached Little League baseball, and assisted 
with several ice hockey organizations. Every hour that Mark devotes to 
one of these causes shows his true character--one that is service-
oriented and generous.
  Some of the hallmarks of a great career in public service are 
competence and a keen awareness of the issues facing your constituency. 
Legislator Mark Grozio exemplified these 2 characteristics for 10 years 
in the county legislature, and all the residents of Niagara County owe 
him a debt of gratitude. After countless hearings, meetings, and 
events, it is time that we wish Mark a very happy retirement. He will 
surely enjoy more time with his wife of 40 years, Lynda, and his entire 
family. In the meantime, his community will continue to reap the 
benefits of his career of hard work.

  RECOGNIZING VICTORIA SWANSON JAMES&#x27; LIFE AND SERVICE TO THE CITY OF 
                               YPSILANTI

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DEBBIE DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Victoria 
Swanson James, a resident of Ypsilanti, Michigan whose life her 
community is celebrating on her passing. Her lifelong dedication to her 
family, church, and community is worthy of remembrance and 
commendation.
  An Ypsilanti native, Victoria earned her Bachelor&#x27;s in Education from 
our great Eastern Michigan University. After earning a Master&#x27;s in 
Education as well as a Certificate of School Administration, Victoria 
served as an educator in the Willow Run and Ann Arbor Public Schools 
for over a decade. In 1978, she answered the call to the ministry. She 
was later ordained in 1981 at the Metropolitan Memorial Baptist Church, 
also in Ypsilanti. Under the leadership of the late Rev. Dr. S.L. 
Roberson, Victoria served as his First Assistant for over 20 years.
  Outgrowing her role as an assistant, Victoria founded the Ekklesia 
Fellowship Ministries in Ypsilanti in 2000 and assumed the role of 
Pastor. In 2004, she founded the ``Women of The Word, Too&#x27;&#x27; an 
organization that provides mentoring and an outlet for women clergy 
throughout Washtenaw County and the surrounding area. Active in a range 
of organizations, Pastor James&#x27;s service areas were quite extensive: 
member of the Love Ypsi Pastors Network, Washtenaw County Sheriff 
Council of Clergy, Hope Clinic Board of Directors, Pastoral Advisory 
Council for the Hope Clinic, former President of the Ypsilanti Gateway 
Economic Development Board, and former 1st Vice-President of the 
Ypsilanti Willow Run branch of the NAACP. Victoria&#x27;s son, DeVaughn, who 
has been preaching in her stead, had this to say: ``She loved her city. 
Mom believed in the village mindset. There&#x27;s a proverb in our community 
that says `it takes a village to raise a child.&#x27; Mom was confident in 
the strength and richness of the Ypsilanti village. That&#x27;s why she 
committed her life to uplifting this village.&#x27;&#x27;
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the 
life service of Pastor Victoria Swanson James. Despite being the mother 
of 8 and Nana of 15, Victoria always had love to spare for her 
congregation and her community. We remember her fondly, and her 
presence will continue to be felt in the Ypsilanti community for years 
to come.

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the 
life of United States Marine Corps Sergeant John Edward Dingman.
  John Dingman was born on September 2, 1950, in Chatham, New York. He 
attended

[[Page E833]]

Maple Hill High School before enlisting with the United States Marine 
Corps in August 1969. Sergeant Dingman served bravely in the Vietnam 
War as a Special Radio Operator from 1969 to 1973. Upon his honorable 
discharge, he earned the National Defense Service Medal and the Good 
Conduct Medal.
  Returning to civilian life, Sergeant Dingman began a 40-year career 
with General Electric Plastics in Selkirk, New York. He and his wife 
Linda Jewett Dingman were married on October 8, 1983. The couple raised 
their 3 children--Beth, Jason, and Melanie--together in Rensselaer 
County. Family always came first for Sergeant Dingman as a father, a 
grandfather, and eventually a great-grandfather.
  Sergeant Dingman was a lifelong and avid outdoorsman. He enjoyed 
hunting, fishing, and camping in the wilderness, and shared his 
expertise with his community as a fish and game instructor. His ideal 
getaway was the Adirondack Gateway RV Resort. A member of the National 
Rifle Association, Sergeant Dingman also taught rifle classes and bow-
hunting courses.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I am honored to 
recognize the life of Sergeant John E. Dingman; a soldier, a mentor, 
and a family man.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday of 
Schreiner University in Kerrville, TX. A generous donation of land and 
finances by Captain Charles Schreiner in 1917 made this possible. He 
served with distinction in the Texas Rangers.
  Capt. Schreiner outlined his vision for the Institute as ``facilities 
for high grade instruction and military training for boys and young men 
as preparation for college and university work.&#x27;&#x27;
  James J. Delaney served as the first president of Schreiner 
Institute. From the beginning, it has been committed to the Reformed 
tradition of the Presbyterian Church.
  The first class of female students was admitted during World War II. 
Formal military training ended in 1971, and the Institute became fully 
coeducational.
  In the year 2000, Schreiner&#x27;s governing board voted to change the 
school&#x27;s name to Schreiner University. The years immediately following 
the name change saw various renovations and new buildings take shape on 
campus.
  Online classes started in 2014 and have expanded since then, now 
including a full online master&#x27;s program. Recently, Schreiner 
introduced their Military Academy Preparatory School to provide paths 
for students into military service.
  In its 100th year, Schreiner University is proud to bring back a 
pastime from its early days, football. Other sport disciplines for 
students include soccer, wrestling, equestrian, shooting sports, and 
tennis.
  Today, Schreiner University president Charlie McCormick oversees a 
campus that offers over 30 different degree options. I am proud that 
the Hill Country is home to a university the caliber of Schreiner. 
Congratulations on 100 years of helping students achieve more.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 12, 2023

  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 150th Anniversary 
of the Village of Wellston, Ohio. Since its founding in 1873, the 
Village of Wellston has been an important industrial and historical 
center of Southeast Ohio for nearly 2 centuries.
  Harvey Wells, a Civil War veteran and Ohio native, used part of his 
Jackson County property to establish Wellston. Wellston was officially 
incorporated as a Village in 1876 with the hopes of being the ``New 
Pittsburgh of the West.&#x27;&#x27;
  With the construction of numerous blast furnaces, the Village of 
Wellston solidified itself as an important industrial and mining town 
in Southern Ohio. Wellston also played an important role in the 
Underground Railroad system acting as one of the first stops in the 
North and became the settling point for several freed slaves.
  Throughout its history, the Village of Wellston has been a beacon of 
prosperity and freedom for Southern Ohio, and I am honored to represent 
a town with such a rich history and strong sense of community.
  Again, I want to congratulate the Village of Wellston on celebrating 
its 150th Anniversary and recognize their importance to Jackson County 
and all of Southern Ohio. May they continue to prosper over the 
centuries to come.

                          ____________________
