CONGRATULATING &amp; WISHING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HONORABLE ALGENON L. MARBLEY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOYCE BEATTY

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 1, 2024

  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished 
service of the Honorable Algenon L. Marbley from my district, who has 
served the Southern District of Ohio since 1997, after his appointment 
by President Clinton and unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate.
  In 2019, Judge Marbley became the first African American from the 
segregated South to serve as Chief District Judge for the Southern 
District of Ohio. Under his leadership, the Court remained one of the 
Nation&#x27;s most productive, even through the challenges of the COVID-19 
pandemic.
  In 2023, the District was ranked in the top 15 most productive 
federal district courts, and his dedication to justice is unparalleled.
  As Chief Judge Marbley celebrates his 70th birthday and concludes his 
tenure, I extend my deepest gratitude for his service and friendship 
and wish him continued success in his next chapter.

                          ____________________

                      HONORING DR. BARBARA NIELSEN

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 1, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, South Carolina will always 
recognize and cherish the dedicated service of Dr. Barbara Nielsen. She 
heroically was the first Republican elected State Superintendent in 125 
years, in addition to being the first woman. During her service as a 
member of the State Senate Education Committee, I know of her 
relentless devotion that all students can achieve.
  Below is the obituary of the historic Sauls Funeral Home recounting 
her life of December 2, 1942, to September 3, 2024. She and Dennis are 
noted for their beautiful Moss Creek home in Bluffton, highlighted by 
500-year-old oak trees at the entrance of U.S. Highway 278, which they 
saved when the highway was widened to eight lanes.
       Dr. Barbara Nielsen of Hilton Head Island, SC, passed away 
     on Tuesday, September 3, 2024. Dr. Nielsen was a shining 
     light in the field of education. Dr. Nielsen believed 
     fiercely in the God-given potential of every student and 
     dedicated her life to equipping them to reach it. She never 
     lost faith in the belief of what a great education can bring. 
     Dr. Barbara Nielsen was the first woman to ever be elected as 
     South Carolina&#x27;s Superintendent of Education and served two 
     consecutive terms from 1991 to 1999.
       During her tenure as superintendent, Dr. Nielsen campaigned 
     for significant legislation on education reform. Most 
     noteworthy among these were the state&#x27;s 1998 Education 
     Accountability Act, the law that made possible the state&#x27;s 
     first full-day kindergarten program, and the legislation that 
     paved the way for the establishment of charter schools in 
     South Carolina.
       Prior to her role as superintendent, Dr. Nielsen&#x27;s career 
     in education spanned three decades as an administrator, an 
     educational consultant, and as a teacher in Louisville, KY 
     and Beaufort, SC. She held a doctorate degree in educational 
     administration and planning and a master&#x27;s degree in guidance 
     and counseling from the University of Louisville, and an 
     undergraduate degree from the University of Dayton. A 
     multitude of accolades and tributes continue to pour in, 
     reflecting the widespread respect and admiration she garnered 
     over the years. Among her highest awards were The South 
     Carolina Order of the Palmetto, and she was Commissioned as A 
     Kentucky Colonel.
       Even after her retirement, Dr. Nielsen never ceased her 
     efforts in advocacy for students and teachers alike. In 2023, 
     she notably chaired the state&#x27;s 17-member Teacher Recruitment 
     and Retention Task Force, a panel dedicated to finding 
     innovative ways to recruit and retain quality educators 
     within the state.
       Governor Henry McMaster called Nielsen&#x27;s death ``a profound 
     loss&#x27;&#x27; for the state and hailed her as ``a true pioneer and 
     an inspiration to many.&#x27;&#x27; He said, ``Her commitment to 
     modernizing and reforming our education system transformed 
     the lives of thousands upon thousands of our children.&#x27;&#x27;
       Her passion and devotion to family were most important to 
     her. She was especially proud of her grandchildren and loved 
     every moment she had with them. Left to cherish our memories 
     of Barbara are her Husband: Dr. Dennis J. Nielsen; her 
     Daughters: Michelle Preli (Evan Sklar) of Brooklyn, NY and 
     Tina Beck (Jamison Beck) of Charleston, SC; her Brothers: 
     Larry Stock (Linn) of Cincinnati, OH, Dennis Stock (Carolyn) 
     of Cincinnati, OH, Tony Stock (Sally) of Cincinnati, OH, and 
     Mike Stock (Becky) of Cincinnati, OH; her Sisters: Judy 
     Forrester of Cincinnati, OH and Patti Reilly (Tim) of 
     Cincinnati, OH, and her Grandchildren: Emmitt Sklar, Ava 
     Sklar, and Jacob Beck.
       In lieu of flowers, donations to St. Jude&#x27;s Hospital would 
     be appreciated.
       To plant a beautiful memorial tree in memory of Dr. Barbara 
     Stock (Stock) Nielsen, please visit our Tree Store (&lt;a href=&#x27;https://

                        Tuesday, October 1, 2024

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Revolutionary 
War Veteran Dr. Eleazer Root on the occasion of the laying of a plaque 
in his honor at Oak Grove Cemetery located in Manchester, Michigan. 
Freedom is not free, and today we pause to remember a man who served 
his country with honor during the Revolutionary War. His service to our 
Nation at the time of its birth is worthy of commendation.
  Born in Coventry, Connecticut in July of 1764, Dr. Root first 
enlisted in the Continental Army as a Private at the tender age of 15. 
He was stationed at West Point, New York, where he contributed to the 
fight for American independence. Following his military service, Dr. 
Root moved to Manchester, Michigan not long after its founding in the 
early 1800s. He died in 1837 at the age of 72, and Dr. Root&#x27;s grave was 
the first at Oak Grove Cemetery.
  Doctor Root is remembered for his honorable military service and 
dedication to our Nation. He is just one of the few native and adopted 
Michiganders who fought for our country during the revolution. It is 
important for us to honor the veterans of our community who fought for 
the freedom of our Nation, a value we continue to hold dear today. We 
are thankful for the path these soldiers laid out for past, present and 
future Americans over two centuries ago.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 
honorable Dr. Eleazor Root as he is memorialized in Manchester, 
Michigan. We join with Americans everywhere in extending our thanks to 
the Huron Valley Chapter of the National Society of the Sons of the 
American Revolution, Ypsilanti Chapter Daughters of the American 
Revolution, and the Sarah Caswell Angell Chapter Daughters of the 
American Revolution for their work dedication to honoring Dr. Root in 
the run up to Nation&#x27;s 250th anniversary. Today and every day, we honor 
the brave patriots we lost in the fight for our independence. We are 
grateful for their military service and their willingness to fight for 
the freedom and liberty that we enjoy today.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 1, 2024

  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
retirement of Mr. Scott Orr from Georgia Power.
  Mr. Orr has been led an impressive 42-year career and has been a 
great advocate for Georgians as Georgia Power&#x27;s Manager of Federal 
Legislative Affairs.
  Scott Orr began his career at Georgia Power in 1982, and since then 
has held a number of roles in the company including customer service, 
sales, and his role in Federal Legislative Affairs.
  He has been a great friend not just to our office but to the Georgia 
delegation as a whole, having worked with several different members 
throughout his career!
  Outside of work, Orr&#x27;s service has made a great impact on his 
community.
  Scott has served as the Vice Chair of the Georgia Youth Challenge 
Academy Foundation&#x27;s Board of Directors, the Athens Chamber of 
Commerce, United Way of Northeast Georgia, and many others!
  Thank you, Scott Orr, for your decades of service to Georgia, and 
congratulations on your well-earned retirement.

                          ____________________

     RECOGNIZING DONALD GENE JOHNSON WITH A CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN 
                              COMMENDATION

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PETE SESSIONS

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 1, 2024

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Donald Gene Johnson, 
of Groesbeck, Texas, by presenting him with a Congressional Veteran 
Commendation. His pledge to champion values of support and sacrifice 
exemplifies American patriotism.
  Born in Texas, Donald received his draft notice in October 1965 and 
joined the Army to serve during the Vietnam War. He underwent basic 
training at Fort Carson, Colorado, before being deployed to the front 
lines in Vietnam. While overseas, he carried out critical operations 
vital to his unit&#x27;s success, such as establishing forward base camps 
and managing supply runs. His efforts were essential in maintaining the 
operational effectiveness of his fellow soldiers under challenging and 
often perilous conditions.
  One fateful night, while stationed at a listening post outside the 
perimeter, Specialist Johnson and three other soldiers were struck by a 
mortar round. Despite being severely injured, he remained composed and 
took actions that saved lives under extreme adversity. For his 
extraordinary courage and selflessness in the face of danger, he was 
awarded the Purple Heart, a testament to his bravery and dedication.
  After returning to Texas, Donald channeled his entrepreneurial spirit 
into building a successful Pepperidge Farm franchise in Houston. Upon 
selling the business, he returned to Limestone County to operate a 
cattle ranch, applying the same dedication and hard work that 
characterized his military service. His commitment to his community 
remained strong; he drove a school bus for the Groesbeck Independent 
School District, serving as an inspirational mentor to many young 
people. Additionally, he worked as a jailer at the Limestone County 
Jail, where he continued to positively influence lives through his 
mentorship.
  Donald&#x27;s military honors include the Purple Heart, the Rifle 
Sharpshooter qualification, the Vietnam Service Medal with two Bronze 
Service Stars, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the National 
Defense Service Medal. These accolades reflect his commitment to 
excellence and the sacrifices he made during his service.
  He is part of a remarkable family legacy of service; his four 
brothers, Charles, Foy, Edwin, and Cecil, also served in the military, 
each risking their lives for their country. This collective dedication 
underscores their character and commitment to the Nation.
  I am honored to award Donald Gene Johnson with a Congressional 
Veteran Commendation. His life of service and dedication embodies the 
spirit of American patriotism, demonstrating an unwavering commitment 
to his country and community.

  Michele grew up in Hudson, Texas, and after graduating enlisted in 
the United States Air Force in Des Moines, Iowa, in March of 1993. She

she served in support of Operation Desert Shield/Storm with the

awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with one Oak Leaf Cluster, 
Air Force Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and Air 
Force Training Ribbon.
  As a disabled veteran, Michele works tirelessly to give back to her 
community and the veterans she serves. She is the go-to person for 
approximately 4,800 veterans in Angelina County. She wears many hats, 
from volunteering with the American Legion, to her career as the 
Military Veteran Peer Service Coordinator with the Burke Center. She 
works to develop and maintain relationships with veteran organizations 
and local non-profit organizations that assist veterans to develop a 
network of support and resources to assist homeless veterans and their 
families who need household assistance/items and repairs. Michele has 
opened her home personally to assist homeless veterans. She works 
diligently every day to make sure no veteran who crosses her path falls 
through the system. Michele promotes camaraderie within veterans 
through the Valentines for Vets, Donuts with Veterans and the Deep East 
Texas Stand Down Event. She volunteers to instill patriotism in her 
community by coordinating the annual Flag Day ceremony at the VFW Post 
1836, and honors freedom and bravery at the Wreaths Across America 
Ceremony where 1200 wreaths are placed on the graves of local veterans. 
Michele has been recognized for her outstanding volunteer service at 
the local, state, and national level.
  It is my honor to award Linda Michele Conner with a Congressional 
Veteran Commendation from the 17th Congressional District of Texas.

  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to present Milton Evans Ladnier, of 
Crockett, Texas, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation. His service 
to the Nation and community speaks to the best of Texas.
  A native Texan, Milton was first called to duty by the United States 
Army on March 28, 1969, at the young age of 19. He served during the 
Vietnam conflict as a helicopter mechanic crew chief in the Central 
Highlands with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, earning the Vietnam Service 
Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal 
and Army Commendation Medal. In the 1990&#x27;s Milton worked as an 
appraiser in Harris County and enlisted in the Army National Guard at 
Ellington Field. After several years with the Guard, he signed on as a 
full-time civil service technician and was called to Active Duty in 
2006 during Operation Iraqi Freedom. At the time, he was 55 years old 
and was assigned as supervisor to thirteen young soldiers in the 
helicopter engine repair shop. He received his honorable discharge in 
2007. Milton was awarded the Bronze Star, National Defense Service 
Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Army 
Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and the Armed Services Reserve 
Medal.
  Milton moved to Crockett in 2017, where he immediately became 
involved with the local American Legion Post 134, serving as Commander 
two separate terms. He served as the Houston County Veterans Service 
Officer for two years and continues to support local veterans. He was 
instrumental in renovating the American Legion Post and developed the 
monthly luncheon for veterans and their families at the Post. Many days 
you can find Milton volunteering his time to drive veterans to their 
medical appointments, as he is always helping others. The American 
Legion has awarded him twice as the Veteran of the Year for his ongoing 
support of local veterans.
  It is my honor to award Milton Evans Ladnier with a Congressional 
Veteran Commendation from the 17th Congressional District of Texas.

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Northwest 
Michigan Action Agency for their 50 years of service to the Northern 
Michigan community.
  Since 1974, NMCAA has provided Northern Michigan with community-based 
service, helping bridge the gap between poverty and self-sustainability 
by supporting independence and enhancing the quality of life for 
residents. Providing assistance for 10 counties across Northwest 
Michigan, NMCAA has touched countless lives and helped families from 
across the region find opportunities which due to unfortunate 
circumstances may have not been available to them otherwise.
  During their half century of service, NMCAA has become an anchor for 
the Northwest Michigan Community. It is a place providing opportunity 
for those who need it most and the organization has certainly lived up 
to their self-stated mission of fostering positive change, improving 
quality of life, and building stronger and more connected communities. 
NMCAA provides a multitude of services for residents, ranging from 
Housing and Energy Efficiency Services, Homeless Prevention Programs 
all the way to Economic Security and Child/Family Development 
initiatives. Their broad scope of assistance is a credit to the 
phenomenal staff and volunteers of NMCAA, who work tirelessly year-
round to ensure that their impact is felt in the community.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Northwest Michigan Action 
Agency for their 50 years of service to the Northern Michigan community 
and I wish them nothing but continued success in the future.

                     TRIBUTE TO DR. CARLOS CAMACHO

                                 ______
                                 

                  HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN

                    of the northern mariana islands

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, October 1, 2024

  Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Carlos Sablan 
Camacho, the first Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands and a man 
who has devoted his life to the health and welfare of our island 
community.
  Dr. Camacho was born to Luis Taimanao Camacho and Ramona Sablan 
Camacho on November 4, 1937, on the island of Saipan, during the 
Japanese administration.
  He witnessed as a child the effects of World War II and particularly 
the Battle of Saipan in 1944, in which one in ten Mariana islanders 
lost their life.
  For a person in our community, Carlos Camacho had unusual access to 
education during his formative years. He completed nine years of 
schooling in the Marianas, then in 1954 left for the island of Chuuk, 
where he attended the Pacific Island Central School and studied basic 
medicine and dentistry.
  Two years later, he was recruited to attend the Fiji School of 
Medicine. There he received advanced medical training and after six 
years received a degree to practice medicine. He returned home to the 
Marianas and went to work at the Dr. Torres Hospital.
  He returned to learning in 1971, when he began work on an advanced 
degree in Public Health at the University of Hawaii--Manoa. Signaling 
his accomplishment, Dr. Camacho was chosen to represent the School of 
Public Health and the Pacific Islands at the Colorado Medical Center 
Seminar in 1972. Upon completion of his studies, he returned from 
Hawaii and took up work on Saipan as the Chief Medical Officer of the 
public Health Service.
  It was then that Dr. Camacho turned his attention to governance. In 
1976, he was elected to the Congress of Micronesia. He became President 
of the Saipan Democratic Party. After the people of the Marianas voted 
to join the United States as a self-governing Commonwealth, Dr. Camacho 
was appointed to the convention that drafted the Constitution under 
which we now live.
  When that Constitution first became effective in 1977, Dr. Camacho 
was elected the first Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands and took office on January 9, 1978.
  During his term as governor, Dr. Camacho fought against the 
implementation of gambling in our islands, was a leading voice 
protesting nuclear waste dumping in the Pacific, and managed the 
transition from governance by the United Nations Trust Territory of the 
Pacific Islands to self-government by the people of the Marianas.
  He was a strong advocate for our newly formed Commonwealth government 
throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific. In the capitol of the Nation 
we chose to join, he forged a special working relationship with U.S. 
Congressman Phillip Burton, who had been instrumental behind the scenes 
in negotiating the Marianas Covenant of Political Union with the United 
States and who won approval for the Covenant in just three days&#x27; time 
here in the House of Representatives.

[[Page E998]]

  After serving one term as governor, Dr. Camacho retired from public 
service in 1981 and went into private business.
  Dr. Camacho is married to Lourdes Winefreda Ito Pangelinan. They 
share seven children: Carla, Mona Lynn, Carlos Patrick, Kevin Frank, 
Francine, Jiana, and Franklin Luis; four grandchildren: Carlos Joe, 
Liana Margaret, Lucas Patrick, and Leia Rose.
  His own early life experiences as a colonial subject of the Japanese 
empire and witness to the ravages of war greatly shaped Dr. Camacho&#x27;s 
commitment to public service. His example of learning and service 
inspires us today and is a legacy he leaves for future generations in 
the Northern Mariana Islands and beyond.
