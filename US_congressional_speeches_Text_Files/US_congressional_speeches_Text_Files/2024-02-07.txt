     BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING DR. SAMUEL EDWARD HOLLOWAY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor a man who was a trailblazer 
in athletics and

[[Page E126]]

education, and used his talents to break barriers and change the lives 
of generations of young people. Dr. Samuel Edward Holloway lived to 
serve others: his nation, his community, and his family. It is fitting 
that as we mark Black History Month, we shine a light on his place in 
the history of Michigan&#x27;s 7th District and the many doors he opened for 
others to pass through.
  But before he was Dr. Holloway, he was simply ``Sam,&#x27;&#x27; a young man 
who came to Michigan with his father, who had left the deep South as 
part of the Great Migration. After spending his childhood in various 
parts of the Midwest, Sam and his family settled in Michigan in the 
1940s, where he would eventually join the Ann Arbor High School class 
of 1951. Sam&#x27;s athletic abilities were evident from a young age, as he 
was crowned state champion in his wrestling class during his high 
school years. Also clear was his desire to use his life for the greater 
good, as he enlisted in the United States Army upon graduation, and was 
honorably discharged in 1953.
  It was then that Sam began embarking on what would become his life&#x27;s 
calling: public education. He received his Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s 
degrees from Eastern Michigan University, during which time he also 
began his teaching career. And so it was, at the height of the civil 
rights movement in 1963, when Samuel Edward Holloway became the first 
Black faculty member in the history of South Lyon Public Schools. 
During his tenure there, he is also credited with becoming the first 
Black person to serve as head wrestling coach for a high school team in 
the state of Michigan.
  Eventually Holloway earned his PhD in education, and went on to serve 
in numerous districts, including Ypsilanti Public Schools and Romulus 
Public Schools. In the late 1970s he became a building administrator at 
Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, a full circle moment for the man who 
had graduated from that very district. He held that post until his 
retirement in 1990, a retirement that he and his wife Janet enjoyed to 
the fullest. Still an athlete at heart and in practice, Holloway 
competed each year in the Arizona Senior Olympics, and rode his 
motorcycle across the United States and Europe.
  Dr. Samuel Edward Holloway passed away in 2022, leaving behind his 
devoted wife, his four children, a large and loving extended family, 
and an incredible legacy. Dr. Holloway didn&#x27;t set out to be a pioneer; 
he simply wanted to do the things he loved in the service of others. I 
now ask that the People&#x27;s House reflect his groundbreaking 
contributions and the gratitude of the institutions forever changed by 
his presence.

           BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING RODNEY WHITAKER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a member of the 
Michigan State University faculty who has contributed to the rich 
artistic landscape of our great state and helped shape the next 
generation of musical talents, all set to a distinctive jazz beat.
  As a young recording artist in Detroit, Rodney Whitaker likely never 
imagined he would one day build and lead one of the most distinguished 
jazz degree programs and performing faculties in the world. But the 
legendary bassist, known for his distinctive ``bear-sized&#x27;&#x27; tones, 
today serves as Director of Jazz Studies at MSU, a program he has 
transformed into a world class training ground whose students have gone 
on to perform alongside some of the top jazz artists in the world.
  It&#x27;s a case of those who CAN do, teach, as Whitaker himself spent 
seven years as bassist with Wynton Marsalis&#x27; Septet and the Lincoln 
Center Jazz Orchestra, followed by a quarter-century touring around the 
world, collaborating and performing with ]egendary jazz artists from 
Dizzy Gillespie to Diana Krall. And he continues to teach master 
classes at universities around the world, all while serving as artistic 
director of the Michigan State University Professors of Jazz, the East 
Lansing Summer Solstice Jazz Festival, the Dr. Phillips Center Jazz 
Orchestra in Orlando, Florida, and the Gathering Orchestra in Detroit, 
to name a few of his many involvements.
  He has earned one of the highest distinctions in academia, the title 
of University Distinguished Professor, and he is proud to serve as a 
special assistant to the dean&#x27;s office, directing the College of 
Music&#x27;s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging efforts. In 2006, he 
was nominated for the Juno Award, Canada&#x27;s equivalent to the Grammy, 
and in 2011, he received an Emmy nomination. Just last year he was 
named 2023 Detroit Jazz Hero by the Jazz Journalists Association.
  But strip away all the titles, all the awards, and Whitaker is simply 
a man who understands the power of the gift he has been given, and the 
necessity to pass it on. In his own words, Dr. Rodney Whitaker said, 
quote:
  ``That is my truth. I love passing on the knowledge of the history of 
music, and it&#x27;s life-changing to see that lightbulb go off in someone. 
It certainly changed my life.&#x27;&#x27;
  For all the lives he has enriched, changed, and set to music, I ask 
that his contributions forever be remembered.

          BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024: HONORING THE CANADY FAMILY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a legendary Lansing 
family that has broken barriers across generations, and continues to 
make history today.
  The story begins in 1927 when the family matriarch, Ms. Hortense 
Canady was born in Chicago. While she didn&#x27;t grow up in Michigan, she 
came to Michigan State University to pursue graduate studies after 
attending Fisk University, where she met her husband, Clinton. In the 
Lansing area, Hortense and Clinton, a World War II veteran and member 
of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, settled, put down roots, and left an 
indelible mark on the community.
  Clinton became a well-known and well-loved dentist, while Hortense 
put her passion for education and civil rights into action, becoming 
the first African American elected to the Lansing School District Board 
of Education in 1968. Four years later, she and several other board 
members were recalled for advocating for desegregation, but Hortense 
did not let that deter her from working toward her core belief that 
everyone deserves access to quality education.
  She sat on the state&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Commission, served as the first 
executive director of the Lansing Community College Foundation, and 
helped found a debutante club in Lansing to fill in a void for young 
Black women who, at the time, were not permitted to share in this 
tradition.
  Hortense founded the Lansing alumnae chapter of her sorority, Delta 
Sigma Theta, and served as its national president from 1983 to 1988. 
She was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2002 and was 
named as one of Ebony magazine&#x27;s Most Influential People. Hortense 
Canady died in 2010 at age 83.
  Not only was Hortense Canady impressive in her own right, but her 
children have continued to blaze their own trails. Her daughter, Alexa 
Canady, is the first African American woman in the nation to become a 
neurosurgeon, and served as chief of neurosurgery at the Children&#x27;s 
Hospital of Michigan from 1987 until her retirement in June 2001. She 
devoted her brilliant mind and her numerous talents to the healing and 
welfare of thousands of young patients over the course of her career, 
and, like her mother, is an inductee in the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of 
Fame. She was also named a Michigander of the Year by the Detroit News 
in 2002.
  All three of Hortense Canady&#x27;s sons became attorneys, including the 
Honorable Judge Clinton Canady III. Before ascending to the bench, 
Canady practiced law for 37 years. He was a founder of the Lansing 
Black Lawyers&#x27; Association, director of the Ingham County Bar 
Association, a commissioner for the Lansing Board of Water and Light, a 
member of the NAACP, and served on the board of the Lansing Symphony 
Association, Central Michigan Legal Aid, and many other organizations. 
Elected to the Ingham County Circuit Court in 2010, Judge Canady served 
through his retirement in 2022, but returned on assignment to help 
address the backlog of cases from the pandemic.
  He and his wife, Rita, have two children who are continuing the 
Canady tradition of service, one as an administrative law judge in 
California, and the other with the United States Department of State.
  The Canady family is part of the very fabric of the Lansing 
community, a fabric stitched with their incredible work ethic, 
commitment to breaking new ground, and to clearing a path for others to 
follow.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to shine a light on the 
incredible accomplishments of a member of the Michigan State University 
jazz community: Associate Professor of Jazz Piano, Xavier Davis.
  It was 1994 and Xavier Davis, then a college student from Grand 
Rapids, Michigan, was performing with a small ensemble at a convention 
in Boston when his tunes caught the ear of the legendary jazz vocalist 
Betty Carter, a native of Flint. Carter scooped him up and brought him 
to New York, hiring him to work exclusively as the pianist for her jazz 
trio.
  Davis spent many years in New York, cultivating his talent, learning 
from and playing with some of the greatest names in jazz, including 
Carl Allen, James Williams, Billy Hart,

[[Page E127]]

Regina Carter, and Wynton Marsalis. He served as musical director for 
the Boy&#x27;s Choir of Harlem during its 1999-2000 season, played keyboard 
for the television series ``Cosby,&#x27;&#x27; and has been featured on more than 
50 albums, including a Grammy-winning collaboration with Christian 
McBride in 2012.
  We&#x27;re so fortunate that after six years of teaching at the famed 
Juilliard School, Davis brought his talents back home and has been 
teaching jazz piano at Michigan State University since 2014.
  In addition to the many students who have benefited from his 
instruction, Davis has also dedicated himself to uplifting his adopted 
hometown of Detroit through his music.
  Supported by a grant from Michigan State University&#x27;s Humanities and 
Arts Research Program, Davis began composing music about Detroit, which 
eventually became a powerful album titled ``Rise Up Detroit.&#x27;&#x27; Through 
his music, Davis focuses on the role Detroit has played on the lives of 
African-Americans and on the world at large, highlighting the 
Underground Railroad, the Great Migration, and the boom days of the 
auto industry.
  Professor Davis is a gifted composer, arranger, and producer of 
music, and widely recognized as one of the most accomplished jazz 
pianists in the world. He is also a proud Michigander, continually 
giving back to the community and the state that put the music in his 
soul.
  While he is the recording artist, it is my distinct pleasure to 
record his accomplishments and convey my gratitude for his 
contributions here.

                         HONORING CINDY MACHADO

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Cindy 
Machado upon her retirement from the Marin Humane Society (Marin 
Humane) after 40 years of extraordinary public service.
  A longtime Northern California resident, Cindy has been fighting for 
the rights and welfare of animals with Marin Humane since 1984. At that 
time, the animal service officer role was dominated by men, but Cindy&#x27;s 
knowledge of animal science, equines and livestock made her an 
effective enforcer of animal control and cruelty laws. She was quickly 
promoted to Field Services Sergeant in 1985 and assumed the role of 
Animal Services Director in 1996, a position she held until her 
retirement.
  Cindy&#x27;s impeccable leadership was critical to establishing Marin 
Humane as a highly respected organization locally, and at the regional, 
national, and international levels. She was instrumental in creating 
the Animal Law Enforcement Academy, a program hosted by Marin Humane 
through Santa Rosa Junior College, in partnership with the California 
Animal Welfare Association (Cal Animals). She also served the Academy 
as an instructor on issues including animal cruelty investigations, 
animal hoarding, and inspections, and managed an annual Advanced 
Academy program for almost two decades.
  From pet shops and cock fighting rings to circuses and amusement 
parks, Cindy has worked tirelessly to end animal cruelty. She has led 
investigations, testified in court, and participated in many 
legislative hearings. Her influence has been far reaching as an 
advocate and educator, leading trainings and workshops on behalf of 
Marin Humane across the world, including at the Brazilian Animal 
Welfare Congress in 2000, in Taiwan with the Humane Society of the 
United States in 2001, and in Mexico with Compassion Without Borders in 
2005.
  Cindy has also been an animal advocate in preparation and response to 
natural disasters. She co-founded the Marin Horse Council&#x27;s Equine 
Evacuation Committee in 2006, represented Marin Humane with Marin&#x27;s 
Emergency Operations Center since 1996, and spearheaded a Marin County 
Veterinary Medical Association and Marin Humane joint committee to 
educate the community on impacts on animals. When a disaster hit, Cindy 
was always quick to act. She deployed to Houston during Hurricane 
Katrina to assist with animal evacuations, the 2009 Cosco Busan oil 
spill in San Francisco Bay, and nearly every wildfire in the region.
  Among her numerous commitments, Cindy is a member and former chair of 
the Marin Humane Advocacy Committee, member and trainer of the 
CalAnimals Training Committee, Advisory Member of the Big Cat Sanctuary 
Alliance, and co-founder of the Marin County Hoarding Alliance 
Taskforce. Cindy was also pivotal in creating a non-lethal predator 
control model in collaboration with Marin&#x27;s Agricultural Commission and 
Project Coyote, which remains in use today.
  Mr. Speaker, I have personally witnessed Cindy in action and can 
attest to her knowledge, skills, and commitment to animal welfare. As 
Cindy Machado retires after 40 years of service, she leaves an 
indelible legacy of good deeds for animals in Marin County and the 
extended region. I respectfully ask that you join me in expressing 
heartfelt gratitude to Cindy for her generosity of spirit, innumerable 
achievements and in sending her best wishes on her next endeavors.

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of 
Jim Kennedy as we celebrate the dedication of the Jim Kennedy Village 
Green at the Contra Costa Centre--Pleasant Hill BART Transit Village.
  Jim was born in Montana and grew up in North Dakota before moving to 
Davis, CA in the 1960s. He received his bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s 
degree in Economics/Environmental Economics from San Diego State 
University. Jim served as Contra Costa County&#x27;s Redevelopment Director 
for 35 years where he spearheaded efforts to improve traffic congestion 
and quality of life throughout the region until his retirement in 2011.
  Jim has worked tirelessly to implement transit-oriented development 
at the Pleasant Hill BART Station Area. Jim led efforts to develop 
office spaces, high density residential spaces, and initiate 
improvements to greenspaces and trails. This effort supports many 
quality jobs and features affordable housing units and convenient 
retail shops along the 680 Corridor. The high-quality housing in 
proximity to recreation and transit also attracts workers from San 
Francisco and other job centers along the BART line. Jim played a vital 
role in overseeing this project and helping to achieve this goal.
  Jim is an active member of the community, having formerly served as 
President, Executive Director, and Board Member of the California 
Redevelopment Association. He also served on the board of the Kennedy-
King Memorial Scholarship Fund from 1987 to 2023 and currently serves 
on the Eden Housing Board of Directors (2013-Present). He is also a 
founding Co-Executive Director of the Pleasant Hill BART Leasing 
Authority.
  The Village Green--the connection between the Iron Horse Trail and 
the Town Square/Fare gates of the BART station--will be named the ``Jim 
Kennedy Village Green&#x27;&#x27; in honor of Jim&#x27;s critical work. This is a 
fitting tribute to his vision and hard work.
  Please join me in recognizing Jim for his many contributions to our 
community and devoted service to Contra Costa County.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida&#x27;s Third Congressional 
District, we wish Mr. Howard Alan Mautner a very happy 100th birthday.
  Howard was born in Rockford, Illinois, on April 28, 1924. When Howard 
was eight years old, his family moved to Madison, Wisconsin. He lived 
there until he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in October 1942 at 
age 18.
  Howard was inducted into the military at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, and 
went to recruit training at what is now known as Keesler Air Force Base 
in Biloxi, Mississippi. He was then assigned to radio school in what is 
now Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois. He learned Morse code 
and radio training. After schooling, he served several months at 
Marshall Army Airfield, adjacent to Fort Riley, Kansas. He then 
reported into an overseas duty staging area at Seymour Johnson Air 
Force Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina. In September 1943, Howard 
headed to Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, where he boarded a Liberty ship 
for the port of Casablanca (Morocco).
  Howard served in Naples, Italy between September 1943 and December 
1944 before heading onto Venice, Italy from December 1944 to May 1945. 
By August 1945, the war was over, but Howard was sent to Vienna, 
Austria, as part of the occupational force. Howard was especially 
grateful to have visited Vienna, as that was his father&#x27;s birthplace in 
the late 1880s. In December 1945, he was transported back to America 
aboard the USS Randolph, landing at Fort Dix in New Jersey, where he 
was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant.
  For the last several decades, Howard has lived in Ocala, Florida, and 
has been a treasured member of the Marion County veterans&#x27; community. 
We are honored to wish him a happy 100th birthday and to thank him for 
his dutiful service to our Nation. Congratulations to Howard on this 
milestone. We are elated to celebrate with him.

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Debra

sheep. This year, as she turned 57 years old, she and Steven won a 
combined 89 ribbons out of the 100 competitions they entered, 22 of 
them being first place prizes.
  Most notably, Debra took home first prize in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Greatest 
Whoopie Pie contest with her pumpkin whoopie pie. Anyone from our 
Commonwealth knows that whoopies pies are essential desserts at any 
Pennsylvanian event.
  Throughout the week, the Berkoskis commuted over 500 miles between 
the Harrisburg Expo Center and their home. In order to

produce all of their entries, they used a total of 360 eggs, 60 pounds 
of sugar, 55 pounds of flour, and 25 pounds of butter.
  Mr. Speaker, it is the dedication of people like the Berkoskis that 
honor Pennsylvania&#x27;s rich agricultural traditions. In addition to being 
active participants in the Farm Show, the Berkoskis operate a 200-year-
old family farm in Conestoga.
  I want to congratulate the Berkoskis on their success at this year&#x27;s 
Farm Show and thank them for their tireless dedication to honoring our 
community&#x27;s rich agricultural heritage and sharing their skills and 
passion with the thousands of individuals who attend the Farm Show each 
year.

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to address the ongoing 
challenges that too many families in America face coping with poverty 
and income inequality. I thank my dear friend, Congressman DeSaulnier, 
for hosing this Special Order hour, and for his tireless work on these 
issues.
  In the richest country in the world, poverty is a policy choice. In 
early 2023, the poverty rate in California rose to 13.2 percent, and 
the child poverty rate to 13.8 percent.
  You cannot disentangle poverty and inequality from systemic racism. 
Latinos remained disproportionately poor. Latinos comprise about half 
of poor Californians, but only around 40 percent of all Californians. 
Additionally, about 13.6 percent of African Americans and 11.5 percent 
of Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders lived in poverty in California at 
the beginning of 2023 compared to 10.2 percent of white residents. That 
is why I reintroduced legislation calling for the establishment of the 
first U.S. Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation. 
This Commission will examine the effects of slavery, institutional 
racism, and discrimination against people of color, and how our history 
impacts laws and policies today.
  But while poverty has a disproportionate impact on people of color, 
poverty afflicts millions of people in America of all racial and ethnic 
backgrounds. That is why I have worked with the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign 
to introduce a resolution calling for a Third Reconstruction to fully 
address poverty from the bottom up. A Third Reconstruction would 
prioritize the needs and demands of the 140 million people in America 
who are poor or one emergency away from economic desperation, with 
policies focused on healthcare, welfare, water, public education, and 
housing.
  Across the country, rents and home prices continue to rise much 
faster than income, exacerbating housing instability during an 
affordable housing supply crisis. A staggering 78 percent of extremely 
low income renters in California are severely cost burdened. meaning 
they spend more than half of their income on housing and utilities. 
This is unacceptable when we have the power and tools to eliminate 
poverty entirely.
  Access to safe and affordable housing, regardless of income, is a 
human right. I am proud to sponsor the DEPOSIT Act, which would provide 
security deposit assistance to low-income renters.
  As Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Poverty Task Force. I won&#x27;t 
stop fighting until we pass comprehensive legislation to eradicate 
poverty, economic inequality, and racial injustice. There is a strong 
correlation between U.S. poverty reduction initiatives and declining 
poverty rates. We must work to ensure that the Child Tax Credit is 
restored to American Rescue Plan levels, which cut child poverty in 
half.
  We must ensure the House remains focused on combating poverty in all 
forms and creating economic opportunity for all Americans. Together, we 
can work to reduce disparities and secure justice for those struggling 
to put food on the table.

      RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PASTOR GREGORY CHRISTOPHER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEREK KILMER

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear 
friend Pastor Gregory Christopher and to recognize his decades of 
service to Tacoma&#x27;s Shiloh Baptist Church and the greater Pierce County 
community.
  Pastor Christopher was called to the Ministry in 1989 and studied 
under the Pastoral leadership of Pastor Lonnie Brown at The Body of 
Christ Christian Church in Tacoma, Washington. He began his tenure with 
Shiloh Baptist Church in Tacoma&#x27;s Hilltop neighborhood in 1993. where 
he is the Senior Pastor, and will be retiring this February 2024.
  In his 23 years on the pulpit, Pastor Christopher has created a 
legacy that puts him on hallowed ground. His dedication to his 
community and his faith places him in the same breath as the legendary 
Black faith leaders of Tacoma, including the late Rev. Earnest Brazill, 
who was Pastor Christopher&#x27;s mentor at Shiloh Baptist Church. In 
addition to his congregational leadership, Pastor Christopher also 
serves on the Tacoma Ministerial Alliance, and is an At-Large Board 
Member of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.
  Pastor Christopher has been a fierce and tireless leader outside the 
Church as well. He is a compassionate advocate for folks experiencing 
homelessness, a champion for racial representation, and a catalyst for 
policy solutions to improve the lives of African Americans in Tacoma 
and throughout the greater Puget Sound region. His work has been 
demonstrated through his service as the President of the Tacoma branch 
of the NAACP, his membership in the Tacoma Pierce County Black 
Collective, and his past service on the board of the Tacoma Urban 
League.
  Pastor Christopher has been at the center of efforts to promote 
racial justice and religious social services for decades, working to 
boost inclusivity through expanding partnerships with marginalized 
communities within Pierce County. His leadership and his mission to 
empower the community have shaped our community for the better.
  Mr. Speaker, beyond detailing all his many accomplishments, I&#x27;d also 
like to express my gratitude for the partner that Pastor Christopher 
has been to my office and to me personally. I&#x27;m proud to call Pastor 
Christopher a friend and have appreciated his sage advice throughout my 
career. While we will miss him at Shiloh, I am happy that he will have 
more time with his family, including his wife, Evelyn, who also is a 
leader in the community, his children, grandchildren, and great 
grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Pastor Gregory Christopher in 
the United States Congress.

     REMEMBERING THE 34TH ANNIVERSARY OF AZERBAIJAN&#x27;S BLACK JANUARY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PAUL A. GOSAR

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 7, 2024

  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 34th 
anniversary of Azerbaijan&#x27;s Black January, During this horrific January 
1990 event. Soviet troops marched into Baku, Azerbaijan to suppress the 
freedom and the sovereignty of the Azeri people. This condemnable 
action by the Soviet Union during Black January contributed to the 
deaths of 147 civilians and the injuring of 744 more.
  The desires of the Azeri people were fair and reasonable, but to 
Soviet ]eaders, these desires were unacceptable and had to be crushed. 
Despite the savage Soviet opposition on Black January, the Azeri people 
remained steadfast in their strong dedication to freedom and self-
determination. This dedication contributed to Azerbaijan ultimately 
gaining its independence in 1991.
  Black January is a striking reminder of communism&#x27;s horrors. The 
death and despair caused by the Soviet Union is shocking example of 
this destructive ideology&#x27;s violent response to dissent and free 
thought. Such a reminder is important not only for America, but the 
whole world. We can never let the odious forces of communism prevail 
against the honorable ideals of liberty and individualism.
  Today, the Republic of Azerbaijan is a key ally of the United States, 
Azerbaijan&#x27;s economic and security partnership advances American 
interests in Eurasia. It is in the best interest of the United States 
and Azerbaijan to maintain close bilateral ties with each other. 
Because of this, I hope the friendship between our two countries will 
flourish for years to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in somber remembrance of 
Black January and the lives tragically lost during this saddening 
event. I also urge my colleagues to join me in strong condemnation of 
the evils of communism, as well as in recognition of the stalwart 
friendship between the United States and the Republic of Azerbaijan.
