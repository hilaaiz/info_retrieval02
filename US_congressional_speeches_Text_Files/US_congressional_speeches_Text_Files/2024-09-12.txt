     CELEBRATING CHAIR JHEANELLE WILKINS, THE PEOPLE&#x27;S POLICYMAKER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KWEISI MFUME

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Maryland leader who 
is a visionary when it comes to policymaking and the epitome of Black 
excellence. Delegate Jheanelle Wilkins is a commanding trailblazer in 
our state who is currently serving as the Chair of the Legislative 
Black Caucus of Maryland.
  Delegate Wilkins was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and moved to the 
United States at just five years old. She was raised in neighboring 
Delaware and attended the University of Delaware before concluding her 
studies with a master&#x27;s degree from American University.
  Chair Wilkins has always been steadfast in her lifelong mission of 
enacting policy change that makes a substantial difference in people&#x27;s 
lives. Before she ever held public office, Wilkins began her 
professional career as an intern at the Leadership Conference on Civil 
and Human Rights. She would impressively develop within the 
organization from her position as an intern all the way to her current 
full-time role as the Director of State and Local Government Affairs 
working fiercely in the realms of immigration reform, education equity, 
and civil rights legislation.
  Wilkins&#x27; first steps into the political arena were through her 
positions on the board of the Montgomery County Association of Black 
Democrats and the Montgomery County Young Democrats. In 2014, she was 
elected to the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee.
  Then, in 2016, she was appointed to fill the vacant state delegate 
seat in the Maryland House of Delegates 20th District--becoming the 
first African American woman to assume this position. From the moment 
she took office, Delegate Wilkins has been a passionate and powerful 
voice in the House of Delegates on behalf of all of her constituents in 
Montgomery County, Maryland. She is respected by so many of her peers 
for being unapologetic in her fight for what is right.

[[Page E895]]

  Delegate Wilkins masterfully embraces the spirit of legislating and 
swiftly transforms her legislative ideas into law. As the Vice Chair of 
the House Ways and Means Committee, she has used her standing within 
the legislature boldly to lead the passage of election policy and 
expanding voter access--including the passage of Maryland&#x27;s permanent 
mail-in ballot list, voting access for incarcerated individuals, and 
expansion of early voting sites.
  Her other legislative pursuits have encompassed other consequential 
policy areas including the passage of legislation pertaining to racial 
profiling and justice reform, maternal health, and increasing 
educational outcomes for all students. Wilkins&#x27; monumental record in 
the House of Delegates resulted in her being elected Chair of the 
Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland in 2022.
  Without question, Chair Wilkins displays steadfast resoluteness with 
the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland as she paves the path forward 
for Maryland&#x27;s diverse communities at the helm of the nation&#x27;s largest 
state Black Caucus. Her tenure as the Caucus Chair has been forward 
thinking, dedicated, and triumphant fighting every day to improve the 
quality of life for Marylanders everywhere.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pen these words to commend Chair 
Jheanelle Wilkins for her pride, determination, and spirit. I am eager 
and enthusiastic for her future, and Maryland&#x27;s future, with Chair 
Wilkins at the forefront of our historic State House.

                          ____________________

  CELEBRATING THE 80TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF BERMAN AND VIOLET LAYER

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate a husband and wife 
from my Congressional district in Dayton, Ohio, who have reached a rare 
milestone, celebrating their 80th wedding anniversary.
  Berman Layer and his wife Violet Layer are both 101 years old. They 
were married on Berman&#x27;s 21st birthday, on September 16, 1944. At the 
time, Berman served in Europe as an aerial photographer in the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. After serving three years in both France and 
Germany, Berman retired from the military and returned home to the 
United States. He used the GI Bill to attend Ohio State University, and 
graduated in 1950.
  During their eight decades of marriage, Berman and Violet have served 
as business and civic leaders in their community. They owned and 
managed a small business called Layer Repair Solutions in Dayton. 
Berman was elected to the Miami Township Board of Trustees in 
Montgomery County and served from 1978 through 1997. He helped 
establish the Miami Township Park Board, was a member of the Ohio 
Township Association, and served as an officer for that organization 
for 15 years.
  Berman and Violet have been faithful members of the Parkview 
Methodist Church in Miamisburg for the past 70 years. They served as 
nature tour guide volunteers for school children at Cox Arboretum for 
over 40 years. They have visited all 50 states and toured 23 foreign 
countries. The couple have one son, two daughters, and eleven 
grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, Berman and Violet&#x27;s love for each other has kept them 
together for more years than many people live. Together, they have 
shared the joys and challenges of marriage, and set a fine example for 
many young husbands and wives.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Berman and Violet 
Layer as they each celebrate 101 years of a life well-lived, and 80 
years of love and treasured memories. I wish them more years of good 
health and happiness together.

                          ____________________

CONGRATULATING MAJOR GENERAL BOBBY M. GINN, JR. ON HIS NEW ROLE AS THE 
           ADJUTANT GENERAL OF THE MISSISSIPPI NATIONAL GUARD

                                 ______

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Major General 
Bobby M. Ginn, Jr. on his new role as the Adjutant General of the 
Mississippi National Guard.
  Major General Bobby Ginn was appointed by Governor Tate Reeves on 
August 1, 2024. From Tylertown, Mississippi, Major General Bobby Ginn 
has a long history of military tradition. His grandfather served in 
WWI, and his father served in WWII, both mobilizing through Camp 
Shelby, Mississippi--the very same military post that Major General 
Ginn commanded from July 2017 through November 2020.
  Ginn has over 34 years of service in the Armed Forces. He started his 
career in 1990 as an enlisted soldier and was commissioned as a 
Logistics Officer in 1993 through Officer Candidate School. He became a 
Supply Officer for Headquarters and Headquarters Co., 114th Area 
Support Group, and then was assigned as a platoon leader in 1994 of the 
367th Maintenance Company--a unit he later commanded. Ginn has 
completed many critical assignments, including playing a vital role in 
the response effort after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He answered the 
call in 2007-2008 when he was deployed overseas during Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. In 2017, he was appointed commander at Camp Shelby and, most 
recently, Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics. Ginn earned a B.S. from 
the University of Southern Mississippi and a Master of Strategic 
Studies degree from the United States Army War College.
  Major General Ginn is a decorated officer having earned the Bronze 
Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, the 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, 
a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and many other commendations.
  I am proud of his appointment as the new Adjutant General of the 
Mississippi National Guard. His service both to our Nation and the 
State of Mississippi are well recognized, and I am thankful for his 
leadership. Major General Bobby Ginn is a true American patriot.

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a 
remarkable individual and a significant milestone. Today, we celebrate 
Bill Massey, the President &amp; CEO of the Peninsula Agency on Aging, on 
his 40th anniversary with the organization.
  For 4 decades, Mr. Massey has shown his commitment and compassion for 
older adults in Hampton Roads, and his work has empowered both older 
adults and their caregivers. Mr. Massey has been a cornerstone in the 
Hampton Roads community, working tirelessly to ensure the Peninsula 
Agency on Aging fulfills its mission to promote healthy aging by 
offering a wide range of services to seniors tailored to their specific 
needs.
  The Peninsula Agency on Aging offers older generations the 
opportunity to foster greater independence, security, and an improved 
quality of life. The organization specifically implements several vital 
programs authorized under the Older Americans Act--the country&#x27;s 
preeminent law that supports our nation&#x27;s seniors. The Peninsula Agency 
on Aging also provides seniors with information regarding Medicare and 
Medicaid, as well as other supports for families and caregivers. In 
2022, under his leadership, the Peninsula Agency on Aging served over 
10,200 clients and provided 183,000 home delivered meals to senior 
citizens as well as transportation for non-emergency medical 
appointments. Simply put, Mr. Massey and his organization have helped 
Virginians stay healthy and safe.
  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Bill Massey&#x27;s 40 years of service with 
the Peninsula Agency on Aging, I want to express my gratitude for all 
of his hard work and dedication to supporting seniors, understanding 
the obstacles they face. His dedication has made a lasting impact.

  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an inspiring 
young girl from my hometown of Las Vegas, New Mexico--Heaven Rose 
Archuleta. Heaven Rose, a seventh grader at West Las Vegas Middle 
School, has already proven herself to be a remarkable young leader. At 
only 13 years old, she delivered a powerful TED Talk about teachers&#x27; 
salaries, earning her first place at the Educators Rising National 
Competition in Washington, D.C.
  Heaven Rose is not only a passionate advocate for strengthening our 
education system, but also an active member of her school and 
community. She participates in cross country, track, and Mathematics, 
Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA) at West Las Vegas Middle 
School and serves at her local church. Her dedication, passion, and 
commitment to her community and education have made her a true role 
model for her peers.
  Her achievements have been recognized across the state. At the first 
New Mexico Highlands University football game this season, she was 
honored at halftime for her accomplishments.
  Heaven Rose Archuleta continues to shine brightly, representing her 
state, city, community, and school district with distinction. She is a 
source of pride for all of us, and I look forward to seeing the many 
ways she will continue to lead and inspire others in the future.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Colonel 
Jacob Helgestad, who recently passed away after a valiant battle with 
cancer.
  Col. Helgestad was born and raised in Lonsdale, Minnesota. He 
attended New Prague High School where he played football, hockey, and 
baseball. His life of service started earlier than most--before he even 
graduated high school, he joined the National Guard as a private. He 
continued to serve in the National Guard while he attended college at 
Mankato State University, where he met his wife, Karry.
  In 2001, Col. Helgestad deployed to Saudi Arabia as an enlisted 
chemical reconnaissance specialist. A few months later, in the wake of 
the tragic events of 9/11, he made the selfless choice to dedicate his 
life to serving our country. He attended Officer Candidate School and 
was commissioned as an Infantry Officer in Ft. Benning, Georgia. He was 
then deployed to Kosovo and later Iraq as a company executive officer 
of an infantry company in the Al Anbar province where he spent two 
years leading the soldiers of Charly Company in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom.
  For his final deployment, Col. Helgestad served as the Battalion 
Commander of the 1-194 Armor Regiment. He led a historic deployment for 
Operation Spartan Shield based out of Camp Buehring, Kuwait. Under his 
leadership, 425 soldiers participated in the evacuation of Kabul, 
Afghanistan in August 2021 by securing vital sectors of Hamid Karzai 
International Airport and providing humanitarian assistance. His 
battalion was awarded the Army Presidential Unit Citation, the U.S. 
military&#x27;s highest unit award, for their work. Col. Helgestad&#x27;s life 
and career were characterized by great personal sacrifice and exemplary 
service. He represented the best that this country has to offer.
  I offer my deepest condolences to Col. Helgestad&#x27;s family--his wife, 
Karry, and his two children, Lucy and Sam. And I thank him and his 
family for their service and dedication to our country.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American and an 
exceptional leader in our U.S. Air Force.
  Colonel John ``JD&#x27;&#x27; Foy has distinguished himself through his 
professional character and dedication by serving this Nation in 
uniform. For the past two years, Colonel Foy served admirably as the 
Director of Congressional Affairs for U.S. Transportation Command where 
he led his team to plan and execute over one hundred congressional 
engagements between the Commander of U.S. Transportation Command and 
Members of Congress.
  Colonel Foy has had a remarkable twenty-three-year career after 
graduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy and commissioning as a 
Second Lieutenant. After graduating with honors from Specialized 
Undergraduate Navigator Training and C-130 Navigator Qualification 
Training, Colonel Foy deployed seven times and accrued over eight 
hundred combat hours, earning the Air Medal six times in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. In 2010, he won the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Cheney Award for 
leading thirty-six Airmen to establish an airfield in Pakistan 
providing aid and relief to over 20 million flood victims. From 2018 to 
2020, as a Squadron Commander in Japan, he led over three hundred 
maintainers and aerial porters to support over twelve thousand missions 
throughout the Indo-Pacific region.
  Later, the Commander of U.S. Transportation Command selected Colonel 
Foy to serve as her Director of Legislative Affairs after graduating 
U.S. Marine Corps War College. As the primary liaison between Members 
of Congress, our staffs, committees, and U.S. Transportation Command, 
Colonel Foy communicated the commander&#x27;s legislative priorities and 
ensured appropriations for three sealift vessels valued at $300 million 
into the Ready Reserve Force and enrollment of the first ten tankers 
into the Tanker Security Program. Colonel Foy also led the charge in 
coordinating the commander&#x27;s support for appropriations of a digital 
U.S. Coast Guard credentialling system that will drastically improve 
accountability of our U.S. merchant mariners.
  Mr. Speaker, next month Colonel Foy will assume command of the 621st 
Contingency Response Group at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New 
Jersey. It has been a great pleasure to work with Colonel Foy during 
his time representing U.S. Transportation Command on Capitol Hill. On 
behalf of our grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless 
service and sacrifice of Colonel Foy and his wife, Natacha. I wish them 
the very best as they continue their journey in our U.S. Air Force. 
They have dedicated their lives to the service of our great Nation.
  Together, We Deliver.

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to those of my 
colleagues who are coming to the Floor this week to speak about, and to 
legislate in response to, the growing threat from the Chinese Communist 
Party. The threat is real, it is significant, and it is the solemn duty 
of this body to respond to it.
  You will hear a lot this week about the threat to our intellectual 
property. You will hear about the threat to our privacy, our economic 
security, and our national security. But I rise today to make sure we 
don&#x27;t overlook the very real threat of food security.
  I&#x27;ve heard Members of both parties say, ``Food security is national 
security.&#x27;&#x27; But tucked into the current version of the House Farm Bill 
is the H.R. 4417--EATS Act of 2023, a bill that would be a gift to the 
CCP. It&#x27;s been lauded by the Chinese media as a way for Chinese-owned 
companies to dominate market share in the American food industry.
  Mr. Speaker, the American Farm Bill should benefit American farmers 
and protect the American food supply. It should not make it easier or 
``more efficient&#x27;&#x27; for the CCP to control our food supply.
  After all, food security is national security.

Operations Officer for the 204th MI Battalion, 66th MI Brigade. She 
then went on to serve in many roles in the United States Military, both 
at home and abroad, from 1995 to 2009, including serving in Korea and 
Iraq. Her career at West Point began in 1999 as an Instructor and 
Assistant Professor with the Department of Social Sciences. Colonel 
Nielsen assumed the role of Professor and Deputy Head of the Department 
of Social Sciences at West Point in 2013 and became the head of the 
department in 2016, where she has served since.
  Colonel Nielsen has written six books, including her most recent 
American National Security, published by Johns Hopkins University Press 
in 2018. Over her distinguished 34-year career, Colonel Nielsen has 
proven herself to be a superb Soldier, an inspirational leader, and an 
outstanding educator. As the Head of the Department of Social Sciences 
for the past eight years, Colonel Nielsen&#x27;s leadership has positioned 
the department to provide a 21st-century outlook for cadets, faculty, 
staff, and the Army.
  Colonel Nielsen&#x27;s unwavering dedication to duty and her lifelong 
impact on the careers of faculty members and future Army officers have 
contributed immeasurably to the Department of Social Sciences and the 
United States Military Academy. I commend Colonel Nielsen for her life-
long service and wish her all the best as she transitions to civilian 
life and continues to serve in new ways.

                                 ______

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lifesaving 
efforts of Deputy Quinten L. Might of the Gibson County Sheriff&#x27;s 
Office and thank him for his continuing service to his community and 
state.
  Deputy Might grew up in the community that he serves today, attending 
and graduating from Wood Memorial High School in Gibson County. After 
graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army where he served as a 
medic. He continued his record of service when he joined the Gibson 
County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in 2019 as a correctional officer and was sworn 
in as a deputy in 2021. At only 25 years old, Quinten has proven that 
he is willing and ready to protect and save the lives of those in his 
community, including in four separate incidents since July of 2023.
  One of these lifesaving occasions was on May 24, 2024, when Deputy 
Might and another deputy responded to a personal injury accident 
involving a two-vehicle collision. Upon arrival, Deputy Might came to 
the aid of an individual who was unconscious and not breathing. Despite 
multiple small explosions from the fire of the crash, the two deputies 
moved the victim to safety, and hooked up an AED unit and began two-
person CPR until the individual thankfully regained consciousness, 
ultimately surviving the incident.
  More recently, on August 9, 2024, Deputy Might responded to a 
residence call about a two-year old girl who fell into a swimming pool 
and was unresponsive. As soon as he arrived, Deputy Might called an 
ambulance and quickly moved the child from the backyard to the front, 
during which time he freed up her airway by striking her back, likely 
saving her life.
  I am grateful that we have law enforcement officers like Deputy 
Quinten Might serving our communities today and thank him for his 
service and dedication to Gibson County, and the State of Indiana.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. James Martin, a 
Hoosier hero of the Vietnam War who has dedicated so much to our 
country and to Indiana. Drafted into the U.S. Army on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 
of 1965, Mr. Martin took on multiple roles in the Army, including 
mailman, fireman, battery clerk, and supply clerk. In Vietnam, he was a 
critical element to the 2nd Howitzer Battalion, 17th Artillery, within 
the notorious 1st Cavalry Division.
  Mr. Martin&#x27;s unit was vital to the war effort, often serving as a 
lifeline to fellow soldiers and the South Vietnamese Army via cover and 
support. He and his fellow men were known as ``Shining Star&#x27;&#x27; by those 
they saved in combat.
  After returning home in 1967, Mr. Martin continued to serve in a 
different way--working in finance with Northwestern National Bank, 
which later became Wells Fargo, and eventually shifting to computer 
work in the final 20 years of his career.
  Since moving to Noblesville in 1998, Mr. Martin has been actively 
involved in Memorial Day and Veterans Day services, contributing his 
time and passion to honoring fellow veterans.
  We are forever thankful to the service of Mr. Martin, and so many 
others who answered the call and sacrifice so much for our Nation. From 
me and on behalf of the people of Indiana&#x27;s 5th District, I thank Mr. 
Martin.

 RECOGNIZING THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF KANSAS CITY&#x27;S UNION MISSION 
                                 CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I jubilantly rise today in celebration of 
the centennial anniversary of Kansas City&#x27;s Union Mission Church. For 
the past century, City Union Mission has valiantly and faithfully 
dedicated itself to its Godly mission of serving the Fifth 
Congressional District&#x27;s community. As a public servant, I am eternally 
grateful for its tireless work and endless sacrifice in service of our 
community. As a pastor, I am awestruck by the institution&#x27;s relentless 
devotion to God and unwavering faith in His mission. Please join me as 
we take a moment to recognize City Union Mission&#x27;s one hundred years of 
service to the Fifth congressional district and to the Lord.
  In 1924, Rev. David Bulkley, an inspired minister and veteran U.S. 
Army Chaplin created City Union Mission Church. Rev. Bulkley served in 
France during the First World War and was understandably shaken by the 
carnage and human cruelty he witnessed there. Upon his return, he and 
his wife, Beulah, made it their mission to prevent the suffering at 
home that David had seen abroad. The Bulkley family set up shop in 
Kansas City&#x27;s West Bottoms neighborhood and immediately began serving 
free meals to the area&#x27;s poor and houseless. From there, City Union 
Mission only continued to grow, expanding to provide shelter, as well 
as food, in the 1930s, and eventually evolving into the citywide 
enterprise we know today.
  City Union Mission&#x27;s vision has stayed consistent with its original 
purpose: to meet the spiritual, physical, and emotional needs of men, 
women, and children who are underserved. The problem the Bulkley family 
observed in our society is still prevalent today; in 2024, around 1,798 
Kansas Citians are without a place to sleep on any given night. As 
relentless and persistent as poverty and homelessness have been in 
Kansas City, City Union Mission has been equally relentless in fighting 
these dire issues. Last year, the Church provided shelter for 210 
people a day on average, providing a total of around 76,899 nights of 
safe shelter. Its work has not stopped there, however; last year, City 
Union Mission provided around 137,834 meals, administered 4,733 medical 
services, and taught 30,236 hours of job training and hands-on 
experience for Kansas Citians. In its full century of operation, City 
Union Mission has developed an inspired, multifaceted approach that 
successfully addresses the needs of Kansas City&#x27;s most needy.
  Our community&#x27;s most vulnerable are also more at risk of substance 
abuse issues and mental health concerns, a harsh reality that the folks 
at City Union Mission were sure to recognize. The Church initially 
addressed this problem in 2018 by establishing the L. Minor Care 
Center, a safe living facility for men with barriers to care and 
special needs, including behavioral health challenges, mental illness, 
and emotional struggles. The L. Minor Care Center is a testament to 
City Union Mission&#x27;s ability and willingness to adapt to the times and 
recognize that mental health is just as important as physical health 
and is similarly imperiled for those who already face the challenges of 
poverty and homelessness.
  When I think about City Union Mission Church, I am reminded of 
Matthew 22:39: ``Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,&#x27;&#x27; as I 
believe that City Union Mission embodies it so perfectly. City Union 
Mission has demonstrated unconditional love for its fellow Kansas 
Citians and their humanity. The organization has executed a such 
flawless vision for a century now to demonstrate the extent of 
Christian charity in its tireless endeavors to serve Kansas City&#x27;s most 
vulnerable. On behalf of the United States Congress and Missouri&#x27;s 
Fifth District, I applaud City Union Mission Church on 100 years of 
faithful service.

 RECOGNIZING THE DISTINGUISHED CAREERS OF THREE RECENTLY RETIRED KVOA 
                              JOURNALISTS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recognize 
the remarkable careers of three distinguished journalists who have 
recently retired from KVOA, one of Tucson&#x27;s premier news organizations: 
Lupita Murillo, Frank Velasco, and Al Mazeika.
  Lupita Murillo joined the KVOA team in 1978 as a general assignment 
reporter, specializing in crime reporting. A pioneer in her field, 
Lupita was the first Hispanic female in broadcasting in South Texas 
before moving to Tucson. Her career at KVOA spans an impressive 46 
years, during which she has garnered numerous accolades, including 
awards from the Arizona Press Club, United Press International, and the 
Associated Press. She has also been honored with several Edward R. 
Murrow awards and has received national recognition from the American 
Women in Radio and Television. Lupita&#x27;s commitment to community service 
is exemplified by her involvement with organization such as the Boys &amp; 
Girls Clubs of Tucson and Santa Cruz County, the Southern Arizona AIDS 
Foundation, and the University of Arizona&#x27;s Mel and Enid Zuckerman 
College of Public Health. Her dedication extends beyond the newsroom, 
making her a cherished member of the Tucson community.
  Frank Velasco has been a steadfast presence at KVOA since 1965, 
starting with janitorial work and rising to become the station&#x27;s first 
official news photographer in 1973. Over his extensive career, Frank 
has witnessed and adapted to significant technological changes in the 
industry. His passion for videography and production has left an 
indelible mark on the station, and his creative contributions have 
shaped many of the station&#x27;s memorable broadcasts. Frank&#x27;s deep-rooted 
connection to KVOA is evident in his long tenure and his role in 
helping the station evolve over decades.
  Al Mazeika joined KVOA in 1975, initially as a part-time booth 
announcer and eventually transitioning into roles such as audio 
technician, technical director, and commercial producer. With nearly 50 
years at the station, Al&#x27;s versatility and dedication have made him an 
integral part of the KVOA family. Known for his engaging voice and 
behind-the-scenes work, Al has not only contributed to commercial 
production but has also made occasional on-air appearances. His 
enduring commitment to KVOA and his personal connection to the station, 
including meeting his wife Cathy through KVOA, highlight the deep ties 
he has with the organization.
  Together, Lupita Murillo, Frank Velasco, and Al Mazeika have 
exemplified excellence in journalism and broadcasting. Their careers 
have enriched the Tucson community and the field of journalism through 
their unwavering dedication, innovative contributions, and deep 
connections to their work and audience.
  We extend our heartfelt gratitude and best wishes to Lupita, Frank, 
and Al in their retirement and life after journalism. Their legacy of 
service and excellence will continue to inspire and influence the next 
generation of journalists and broadcasters.

                        TRIBUTE TO KEVIN UHRICH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 12, 2024

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Kevin Uhrich, the 
long-time editor of the Pasadena Weekly from 1999 to 2020, who passed 
away on August 23 , 2024.
  I had the pleasure of knowing and working with Mr. Uhrich for many 
years. His unwavering dedication, passion for the issues, and intellect 
were on full display for those of us who were lucky enough to work with 
him and read his work. He was truly a remarkable and inspiring 
individual--a champion for social justice issues committed to covering 
the vulnerable and disadvantaged of our community.
  At all times, like any good journalist, Mr. Uhrich sought to uncover 
the truth, and fight for what he felt was right and good in his 
community--always standing up for those whose voices were marginalized 
and who had few other advocates. He could be tough on elected 
officials--I can say that too from personal experience--but that was 
part of his job, part of holding those in power accountable, and he was 
always fair, professional and transparent in his analysis.
  Mr. Uhrich was born on February 24, 1959, and raised in Lebanon, 
Pennsylvania. He moved to Southern California in 1979 to pursue a 
career in journalism. After stints at the LA Daily News and the 
Pasadena Star-News, Uhrich landed at the Weekly, serving as its editor 
for twenty-one years.
  In his passing, Kevin leaves a legacy of service to his community. 
Through his commitment to the public&#x27;s right to information and truth, 
he went above and beyond, not only addressing the critical local issues 
that demanded attention but also shining a light on the often-
overlooked stories that mattered just as much. Kevin truly cared about 
the people he served and made every effort to truly understand the 
people within his articles.
  Mr. Uhrich&#x27;s dedication was recognized through many prestigious 
accolades throughout his journalism career, including the John Anson 
Ford Award and awards from the Association of Alternative Newsmedia 
(AAN), California News Publishers Association (CNPA) and the LA Press 
Club.
  My thoughts go out to Marina, Ted, and the rest of Mr. Uhrich&#x27;s 
family. His legacy will resonate for years to come, and he will always 
be remembered for his work and the bright essence of his spirit.
