                        APPRECIATING DAVE OLSON

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 17, 2025

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dr. Dave 
Olson, President and Program Manager at Savannah River Mission 
Completion (SRMC), upon retirement after more than 40 years of 
dedicated work and service.
  Before being named President and Program Manager, Dr. Olson served as 
the president of the former Savannah River Site (SRS) liquid waste 
contractor. He has years of experience in safety, security, project and 
risk management, maintenance and engineering in nuclear materials 
processing, and much more.
  SRMC is responsible for the safe reduction of curies in aging waste 
tanks at SRS. As one of the Department of Energy&#x27;s largest production 
sites, SRS performs actives ranging from environmental cleanup and 
protection to nuclear materials storage and disposition.
  Under the leadership of Dr. Olson, SRMC has worked more than 21 
million hours without an injury that has caused a missed worked day, 
ensured that all facilities are operating safely and efficiently, and 
met five key regulatory milestones to remove waste from and clean tanks 
to prepare them for operational closure.
  Dr. Olson has many accomplishments to be proud of and has aided 
greatly in the success of SRMC.
  Best wishes for a wonderful retirement. I am appreciative for all he 
has done for South Carolina.

                          ____________________

      CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AQUARIUM OF NIAGARA

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 17, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate six 
decades of the Aquarium of Niagara. An interactive water exhibit that 
celebrates the natural wonders of our aquatic world and provides a 
deeper educational understanding of our diverse ecosystems, the 
Aquarium is a gem of Western New York&#x27;s cultural and educational 
institutions.
  The Aquarium of Niagara was one of the first of its kind. Founded in 
1965 by a small group of chemists and scientists, it served as a 
successful model for inland aquariums around the world. Upon its 
opening, it became the first inland aquarium to develop and use 
artificial seawater to maintain exhibits; this sparked a revolutionary 
practice now used in most inland aquariums.
  Located in Niagara Falls, New York, the Aquarium of Niagara welcomes 
over 200,000 visitors each year and is the only aquatic museum within 
250 miles of the United States. They serve as a hub for educating the 
community on aquatic life, consisting of two buildings and housing 180 
species. Visitors come to see an array of mammals, penguins, and more 
than 1,200 fish and vertebrae, many of those being rescued species. 
Additionally, they provide guests with visual experiences to explore 
all of their marine life exhibits. There is a variety of scheduled 
programming offered daily as well as hands-on experiences that create 
inspiring opportunities for visitors.
  Today, we honor one of Western New York&#x27;s one-of-a-kind 
establishments and its commitment to bringing the wonders of the seas 
to visitors from around the world while providing the highest quality 
of animal care possible. Please join me in celebrating the 60th 
anniversary of the Aquarium of Niagara and their achievements and 
continued success as they remain an enduring source of connection to 
marine life for generations to come.

                          ____________________

               HONORING ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER PAMELA OTT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ERIC SWALWELL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 17, 2025

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pamela Ott on the 
occasion of her retirement after more than two decades of distinguished 
service to the City of Pleasanton, California.
  Pamela has dedicated over 22 years to serving Pleasanton with vision, 
leadership and unwavering commitment to public service. She began her 
career in Pleasanton as Executive Director of the Downtown Association 
and joined the city government in 2003 as the Economic Development 
Director. In 2021, she was appointed Assistant City Manager, a role in 
which she has excelled in until her retirement on June 20, 2025.
  Pamela holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Florida and 
a Master&#x27;s in Organization Development from the University of San 
Francisco. In addition to her public service, she has given her time to 
local causes, including the Valley Humane Society Board and the 
Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley Advisory Board.
  Throughout her career, Pamela has played a vital role in shaping 
Pleasanton&#x27;s economic development. She led major business recruitment 
efforts that brought transformative companies such as Workday, 10x 
Genomics, and Veeva Systems to the city. Her work on the Johnson Drive 
Economic Development Zone helped deliver a vibrant new commercial hub, 
including a Costco and two new hotels.
  When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Pamela took swift action to 
support local businesses by designing and implementing innovative 
recovery programs that helped them stay afloat and connected to their 
customers. Her leadership was essential during a time of great 
uncertainty and change.
  As a Pleasanton resident since 2001, Pamela has been more than a 
public servant, she has been a dedicated neighbor, a compassionate 
leader, and a steadfast champion for her community. As she steps into 
retirement, I offer my deepest gratitude for her service and wish her 
all the best as she is afforded more time with her husband, Jim, and 
daughters, Melissa and Kelsey.

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Marc Espeso is a dedicated public servant, 
skilled communicator, and advocate for the LGBTQ+ community. Since his 
appointment in August 2019, he has served as special assistant to 
Orange County Mayor Jerry L. Demings. In addition, he holds the role of 
digital communications manager for the county. This dual position 
provides him with a unique perspective that combines executive insight 
with hands-on communication strategy.
  Mr. Espeso values efficient and effective communication to Orange 
County&#x27;s 1.5 million residents and 75 million annual visitors. In his 
first year as special assistant, he played a key role in disseminating 
critical health and safety information during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 
leveraging partnerships among local, state, and federal agencies, he 
ensured accurate and accessible updates reached LGBTQ+ residents, 
visitors, and the broader public across the county.
  His experience in crisis communication has been an asset to the 
county&#x27;s Emergency Operations Center. He has contributed to the 
development of award-winning communication plans that delivered life-
saving information to residents before, during, and after major storms 
that impacted Central Florida, including Hurricanes Ian and Nicole in 
2022 and Hurricane Milton in 2024.
  In addition to promoting county programs and services that can

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 17, 2025

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Sabra Raymer is a firefighter paramedic with 
over six years of experience in emergency response, known for her 
humility, resilience, and deep committment to serving others. Like 
anyone else, she is navigating life&#x27;s challenges while striving to 
leave the world better than she found it. She doesn&#x27;t seek recognition 
for titles or accolades but takes pride in being someone who will 
extend a hand when others are down, bring calm to chaos, and offer 
comfort during life&#x27;s hardest moments.
  Raised with strong values of integrity, respect, and love, Sabra 
credits her parents for shaping her character and purpose. Her journey 
hasn&#x27;t been easy--she put herself through school, experienced personal 
lows, and worked relentlessly to rebuild and rise. She knows that life 
will test you, but believes that anything can be overcome with heart 
and determination.
  Her dedication has been recognized with a Community Service Award in 
March 2021, a Letter of Commendation in August 2021, and her courageous 
role in Hurricane Ian water rescue operations, for which she received a 
Campaign Ribbon in February 2024.
  With a heart for advocacy and inclusion, Sabra also helped design and 
launch Pride shirts for her county, raising awareness and fostering a 
culture of belonging within the department. Through this initiative, 
she helped raise over $900 for the Zebra Youth Foundation, supporting 
LGBTQ+ youth in Central Florida.
  Now in the process of becoming a peer support advocate, Sabra is 
especially passionate about mental health awareness in the fire 
service--an industry that can sometimes make individuals feel invisible 
or out of place. With the support of her County and community allies, 
she proudly stands up for those who need to feel seen, supported, and 
valued. She continues to serve not only as a first responder but as a 
voice, a helper, and a source of strength for those in need.

            OPPOSITION TO H.R. 884, H.R. 2056, AND H.R. 2096

                                 ______

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 17, 2025

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, last week the Republican Majority in the 
House of Representatives decided that they know better than the 
residents of the District of Columbia what their local government 
needs.
  All Members of Congress are sent here by our constituents to 
represent their interests, and to vote on matters of federal 
importance. We aren&#x27;t sent here to rule on specific local ordinances or 
funding decisions made by the cities and counties in any of our 
districts. Yet Republicans have brought three bills to the floor--H.R. 
884, H.R. 2056, and H.R. 2096--to do exactly that. They want to tell 
the District of Columbia&#x27;s 700,000 residents that the laws and policies 
they have voted for, and that were crafted by their local elected 
officials, are null and void.
  Mr. Speaker, none of us ran for or were elected to serve as D.C. 
Council members. I&#x27;ve been a city council member. It&#x27;s a very different 
job, with a direct line of responsibility to the residents who elect 
you to deal with everything from potholes to public safety. That local 
representation and local responsiveness is a key part of our democracy, 
and Republicans are proposing to strip that local self-governance away 
from the residents of the District of Columbia.
  If Republicans want to take steps to address an issue with national 
importance, they can bring forward a bill that enforces it nationally. 
I will not vote for these attempts to decide those issues for a single 
district at the local level, whether in the District of Columbia or in 
the districts of any Member here.
  One of the bills before us last week, H.R. 884, would repeal D.C.&#x27;s 
local law that allows

[[Page E585]]

noncitizens to vote in local elections. I have serious concerns with 
allowing noncitizens who do not hold a green card to vote in local 
elections, but this is the wrong way to go about addressing that. I 
voted present because I can&#x27;t support repealing a local D.C. law, but I 
do support having a conversation about how we define voter eligibility 
nationwide.
  I voted No on H.R. 2096, the Protecting Our Nation&#x27;s Capital 
Emergency Act, because it would repeal part of a local D.C. law to give 
the police department increased authority to address incidents of 
serious misconduct and discipline officers. I voted No on H.R. 2056 
because we shouldn&#x27;t be nullifying a local law to tell an individual 
police department where they must divert their resources and how they 
can best serve their community, including residents who are immigrants.
  Mr. Speaker, I respect the will of D.C. residents to shape their 
local government through their local elections, and that is why I do 
not support H.R. 2096, H.R. 2056 or H.R. 884.

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Mr. MyoungSub Choi 
for his exceptional efforts to preserve and share cultural heritage 
through the practice of Taekwondo.
  Mr. Choi understands that Taekwondo is more than a martial art--it is 
a means of storytelling, cultural connection, and youth empowerment. 
Through his leadership and mentorship, he has inspired students across 
North Texas to embrace both the physical and philosophical dimensions 
of the sport.
  By nurturing discipline and pride within a diverse community, Mr. 
Choi has built a lasting legacy. His work during the 23rd Annual Korean 
American National Sports Festival is a testament to his enduring 
commitment to cultural celebration and civic unity.
  We commend Mr. Choi for using sport as a bridge across generations 
and communities.

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Mr. Sangho Ko, Vice 
President of the Dallas Taekwondo Association, for his steadfast 
dedication to Taekwondo as a vehicle for cultural diplomacy and 
community empowerment.
  Mr. Ko has long championed Taekwondo not only as an athletic 
discipline but as a cultural bridge that fosters mutual understanding 
and global citizenship. His work has nurtured countless students who 
carry with them the values of humility, cooperation, and perseverance.
  His leadership in the 23rd Annual Korean American National Sports 
Festival helped showcase the richness of Korean culture and the

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to

Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up

RECOGNIZING THE BRAVERY AND LIFE-SAVING RESPONSE OF LIEUTENANT BRANDON 
                   HALL OF BUCHANAN COUNTY, VIRGINIA

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 17, 2025

  Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional 
courage and service of Lieutenant Brandon Hall of Buchanan County, 
Virginia.
  On May 1st, Lieutenant Hall responded to an emergency in which a 
camper had filled with dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Inside the 
camper were two adults and a child, all unconscious. When faced with an 
invisible but deadly threat, Lieutenant Hall entered the camper, 
removed the victims, and quickly administered critical first aid.
  In a moment of crisis, Lieutenant Hall was among the first to arrive, 
and when faced with danger, he did not pause. Lieutenant Hall&#x27;s bravery 
and quick thinking saved these lives and stand as a testament to the 
selfless courage of the public servants in Virginia&#x27;s Ninth 
Congressional District.
  Today, we recognize Lieutenant Hall for his swift and courageous 
response. The strength and skill he demonstrated in a time of 
emergency, reflect the very best of Southwest Virginia. We thank him 
for his service and are deeply grateful for his dedication.

  RECOGNIZING THE WESTFIELD FIRE DEPARTMENT ON THEIR 150TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

  Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Westfield Fire 
Department as they celebrate 150 years of service to our community. 
Since its founding as a volunteer fire department in 1875, the WFD has 
grown into a career department, providing essential fire protection 
services to the residents of Westfield and the surrounding area. Over 
the past 150 years, they have answered the call in times of need--often 
under dangerous and demanding conditions--a true testament to the 
courage, duty, and selflessness that embody the very best of New 
Jersey&#x27;s first responders. I extend my deepest congratulations to the 
Westfield Fire Department on this milestone anniversary and look 
forward to their continued growth and commitment to public safety for 
many years to come.

                         Tuesday, June 17, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to 
recognize Mr. Travis Brown for his service at Withlacoochee River 
Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up 
Navajo Project. In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled 
over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New 
Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical 
infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for 
generations. Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to 
communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark, 
families to preserve food, and elders to live with greater comfort. 
Despite daunting challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team 
completed a demanding project in just eight days--far ahead of 
expectations--demonstrating professionalism, humility, and unwavering 
commitment to this life-changing mission.
  The impact of WRSEC&#x27;s work goes far beyond electricity; it represents 
a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future 
generations to their ancestral homes. The emotional moment when power 
was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and 
renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project 
made. WREC&#x27;s participation in the ``Light Up Navajo&#x27;&#x27; initiative 
reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and 
respect for the people they serve. Their dedication has energized ten 
homesteads and countless lives, creating a

legacy of service that embodies the true spirit of cooperative values. 
The WREC team&#x27;s journey inspires us all, proving that with compassion 
and teamwork, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome to 
light up lives and communities. I commend the entire team for their 
efforts on this worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to 
our local community.
