                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 9, 2025

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable young man from 
my district, Christian Lowe, a vital member of the Walter H. Dyett High 
School for the Arts boys&#x27; basketball team, the Eagles. This team 
achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School 
Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 
win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025.
  This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a 
profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the 
Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood. A 
decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful 
community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. 
Today, the Eagles&#x27; triumph, in which Christian Lowe played a crucial 
role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a 
community invests in its youth and its institutions.
  Christian Lowe, along with his teammates, demonstrated exceptional 
skill, discipline, and teamwork throughout their season, navigating 
challenges and competing at the highest level. His hard work and 
dedication were integral to the team&#x27;s success, culminating in this 
well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to his 
school, family, and the entire community.
  I also extend my deepest gratitude to Head Coach Jamaal Gill, whose 
visionary leadership and guidance steered the team to this historic 
victory, and to Assistant Coaches Kimani Harris, Pierre Adams, and 
Nathan Townsen, Jr., whose mentorship was vital to the players&#x27; 
development.
  Christian Lowe&#x27;s contribution to the Dyett Eagles&#x27; journey from near 
closure to state champions is an inspiring narrative for us all. It 
underscores the critical importance of supporting our public schools 
and investing in programs that empower young people to achieve their 
fullest potential.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating 
Christian Lowe and the entire Dyett High School boys&#x27; basketball team 
on their momentous achievement and in honoring them for the inspiration 
they provide to communities across our Nation.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANDRE CARSON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 9, 2025

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
James Stephen Irsay, a philanthropist and beloved member of the 
Indianapolis community.
  Jim Irsay&#x27;s remarkable 54-year affiliation with the Colts 
organization began in Baltimore and blossomed in Indianapolis, where he 
became a pillar of the community and a leader in the National Football 
League. As owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts, Jim oversaw 10 
division titles and two AFC Championships--and, of course, a Colts&#x27; 
victory in the Super Bowl XLI on February 4, 2007, marking one of the 
most successful eras in franchise history.
  Jim&#x27;s impact extended far beyond the football field as a passionate 
philanthropist and

[[Page E547]]

pillar in the Indianapolis community. He supported the Irsay Family 
YMCA, Peyton Manning Children&#x27;s Hospital, the Indiana Black Expo, 
Wheeler Mission Center for Women &amp; Children, and Gleaners Food Bank. He 
was also a dedicated advocate for mental health, courageously sharing 
his own journey to break the stigma surrounding addiction and mental 
illness. Through the Irsay family&#x27;s generous support of Kicking the 
Stigma, they invested over $31 million to improve mental health 
awareness, research, and treatment across Indiana and the nation.
  Jim was also a cultural icon, cultivating one of the world&#x27;s greatest 
music and historical collections, sharing it generously as a 
``traveling museum&#x27;&#x27; to inspire and educate. Whether on stage with his 
band or quietly supporting those in need, Jim&#x27;s generosity and spirit 
touched countless lives.
  Above all, Jim cherished his family--his wife Margaret, his three 
daughters, and ten grandchildren, whom he loved deeply and supported 
unconditionally. His devotion to family, football, and community 
defined his life and will leave a legacy in Indianapolis and beyond.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jim Irsay--a man whose 
passion, leadership, and kindness made a profound difference in the 
lives of Hoosiers and NFL fans everywhere. May his memory inspire us 
all to serve with the same dedication and heart.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 9, 2025

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Donna Telesco has made as a volunteer with United 
Way of Hernando County. Donna not only coordinated relief supplies 
inventory at our Family Resource Center (FRC) daily for 2 weeks, she 
was a lead volunteer when it came to identifying unmet needs and 
residential trends as individuals impacted began to open up regarding 
their level of destruction. She prepped supply bags, organized 
inventory, communicated with other volunteers, and showed up each day 
with a smile, ready and willing to help however needed. In preparation 
for Hurricane Milton, just a few short weeks later, Donna helped the 
organization pack up thousands of relief and recovery items onto a 40 
foot trailer. She and her husband patiently waited on stand-by for the 
storm to pass and roads to clear, offering to help again when needed. 
With Milton severely damaging the East side of the county, the 
Withlacoochee River began to overflow at a historic rate, leaving many 
Ridge Manor families with limited access to their homes. As the United 
Way&#x27;s team set up a POD (Point of Distribution) of basic necessities, 
washer/dryer, showers, hot meals, and MRE and water distribution, Donna 
and her husband Billy volunteered daily, connecting with every 
distraught resident along the way. When United Way activated its FRC in 
Ridge Manor, Donna oversaw operations for distribution at the center--
prepackaging food and toiletry bags, creating a procedure to collecting 
and filling the needs, and organizing all items donated to us and 
distributed out. This effort took place daily for 30 days. Without 
Donna and her ability and willingness to coordinate, far fewer people 
would have been helped. As the holidays came and went, Donna kept in 
touch, wanting to donate her time with us in ``blue skies&#x27;&#x27; as well. 
She completed the agency&#x27;s stringent 3-day VITA (Volunteer Income Tax 
Assistance) training in December and became IRS certified to assist 
low-to-moderate income families throughout tax filing season. Donna 
volunteers her time as a tax preparer, working one on one with 
families, at 3 of 5 Hernando preparation sites, equaling a total of 5 
days a week since February (logging over 135 TD). This doesn&#x27;t include 
her endless hours assisting the organization with event prep, 
administrative services, and partnership planning. Donna works 
beautifully in a group setting, as well as independently being able to 
complete projects. She is thoughtful, caring, and always going one step 
beyond you would expect someone to.
  It is clear Donna Telesco has made a profoundly positive impact on 
our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive to 
serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

the collection and distribution of emergency supplies, meals and 
donated services to help those who needed help. A truly selfless 
leader, Ms. Phillips was a strong advocate for bringing in government

  It is clear that Tasha Phillips has made a profoundly positive impact

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Teresa Piechowicz has made to our community as a 
volunteer with the Hernando County Family YMCA. The Hernando County 
Family YMCA is more than just a place--it&#x27;s a community, a support 
system, and a beacon of hope for so many. None of that would be 
possible without dedicated volunteers, like Teresa Piechowicz. Her 
unwavering commitment, boundless energy, and compassionate spirit make 
her an invaluable part of the YMCA family. Teresa&#x27;s impact can be felt 
in every corner of the organization. She is involved in nearly every 
event hosted--always the first to arrive and the last to leave. Whether 
she&#x27;s assisting with youth programs, supporting fundraising 
initiatives, or simply offering a warm smile to a member in need, 
Teresa gives selflessly--never asking for recognition, but always 
making a difference. Her enthusiasm is contagious, inspiring both staff 
and fellow volunteers. She has a unique ability to lift others up, 
ensuring that every person who walks through our doors feels welcomed 
and supported. Her kindness is not just in her words but in her 
actions--consistently stepping in wherever she is needed without 
hesitation. Without individuals like Teresa, the impact of the YMCA in 
Hernando County would not be what it is today. She represents the very 
best of what it means to serve others.
  It is clear Teresa Piechowicz has made a profoundly positive impact 
on our community, and I am grateful for her service. May we all strive 
to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
contributions that Tom Prior has made in our community through his 
volunteerism at the Good Samaritan Clinic in Pasco County since 2014. 
Tom began volunteering in the clinic&#x27;s pharmacy and quickly became one 
of the clinic&#x27;s Eligibility and Referral Specialists. Tom reviews the 
applications for the clinic&#x27;s new and requalifying patients, assuring 
that patients meet the income and residency requirements necessary to 
receive free medical care. Tom always treats all potential patients 
with respect and dignity. He is an inspiration to the staff and his 
fellow volunteers. Tom volunteers at the clinic two to three times a 
week for eight months out of the year. Tom always goes above and 
beyond, always putting the patients&#x27; well-being first. Tom is also a 
loyal supporter of Metropolitan Ministries in Holiday, where he donates 
food and other needed supplies to their program. Pasco County is a 
better place because of dedicated, caring volunteers like, Tom Prior.
  It is clear Tom Prior has made a profoundly positive impact on our

                          Monday, June 9, 2025

  Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, with admiration and appreciation, I wish to 
recognize the 100th anniversary of the Rhode Island State Police. For a 
century, these tireless men and women in uniform have traveled the 
highways and byways of our state to ensure the safety of our 
communities. They have lived up to their creed of honor, integrity, 
fairness, excellence, courage, honesty, and devotion to duty.
  On April 2, 1925 the Rhode Island General Assembly created the 
``Rhode Island Department of State Police.&#x27;&#x27; It was the first such 
organization in our state dedicated to ensuring safety, order, and 
security for Rhode Islanders. What began with just 21 officers 
patrolling on Indian-brand motorcycles has grown into a modern, 
technologically advanced law enforcement agency committed to the 
highest standards of public service.
  From the earliest days of policing rural roads to the current use of 
cutting-edge technology, the agency has continually evolved to meet the 
challenges of each era while striving to maintain the trust and respect 
of the public it serves.
  Even their uniforms made an impression--most notably in 1986, when 
their distinctive attire earned national recognition and was featured 
on the David Letterman Show.
  Over the course of the agency&#x27;s esteemed 100 year history, the 
dedicated men and women of the Rhode Island State Police have worked 
tirelessly to ensure Rhode Islanders&#x27; safety. And I know that for the 
next one hundred years they will continue to serve justice, help 
stranded motorists, and keep our communities safe. As they mark their 
centenary during national law enforcement week, I join every Rhode 
Islander in thanking the Troopers of the Rhode Island State Police for 
their 100 years of public service.

                 TRIBUTE TO DR. EVERETT L. DARGAN, M.D.

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, June 9, 2025

  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Everett 
L. Dargan, an outstanding surgeon, a devoted husband and father, and an 
all-around good citizen of South Carolina. Dr. Dargan passed away on 
April 1, 2025, and leaves an enduring legacy of stewardship, 
excellence, and distinction. He led an inspiring life of remarkable 
achievement and grace as a scholar, surgeon, sportsman, public servant, 
mentor, and friend to many.
  Growing up in Columbia, South Carolina during the Great Depression, 
Dr. Dargan supported his family by shining shoes, delivering 
newspapers, waiting tables, and working summers on his uncles&#x27; family 
farm.
  At the age of 15, Dr. Dargan won a scholarship to Morehouse College 
in Atlanta. He later transferred to the University of Buffalo in 
upstate New York, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology in 
1949. Dr. Dargan continued his education at Howard University&#x27;s College 
of Medicine where he earned his M.D. and won First Prize in Medicine. 
After medical school, he completed his internship at Kings County 
Hospital Center in Brooklyn, New York, and was later named chief 
resident surgeon at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center of the Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine in New York.
  Dr. Dargan interrupted his specialty training to serve in the United 
States Air Force as a captain and commander of the 3910th USAF Hospital 
in Mildenhall/Lakenheath, England, during the Korean War. Later, he 
would continue his commitment to providing quality medical care to 
military veterans through his service to the Dorn Veterans 
Administration Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina.
  Dr. Dargan returned to New York and continued his commitment to 
academic medicine as a researcher and instructor through various 
appointments, including associate professor of surgery at the Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine, chief of surgery at Lincoln Hospital, and 
director of surgery at Sydenham Hospital. At Lincoln Hospital, he met 
his wife, a registered nurse and flight attendant at TWA, Carol Poyner. 
They married in 1965, and later moved to Boston, where Dr. Dargan 
completed his training in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at Boston 
City Hospital, achieving the post of chief resident surgeon, and became 
a thoracic surgical instructor at Boston University Medical Center in 
Massachusetts.
  In keeping with his commitment to academic surgery as teacher, 
practitioner and researcher, he taught medical students and surgical 
residents for more than 12 years. Dr. Dargan was an advocate for 
indigent patient care and quality medical care for veterans.
  In 1978, Dr. Dargan returned to Columbia for the remainder of his 
career, first joining the private medical practice of Cyril Spann, 
M.D., and then joining in partnership with Gerald A Wilson, M.D., to 
form Midlands Surgical Associates, PA, a private surgical practice. He 
remained dedicated to serving his fellow veterans with excellent 
medical care, practicing at Dorn Veterans Medical Center for decades.
  Dr. Dargan was the first African American surgeon to serve as chief 
of surgery and then chief of staff at Richland Memorial Hospital (now 
Prisma Health). A lifelong scholar, he was honored by the Alpha Omega 
Alpha Honor Medical Society in 1996 for his distinguished career of 
leadership in medicine. After retirement from his surgical practice in 
2004, Dr. Dargan worked for the South Carolina Board of Medical 
Examiners for nearly a decade. In 2020, Dr. Dargan received the Dean&#x27;s 
Distinguished Service Award as a Friend of the University of South 
Carolina School of Medicine.
  In a final act of service, Dr. Dargan donated his body to the 
Department of Anatomy at Howard University College of Medicine, to aid 
in the training of future medical professionals.
  Throughout his career, he trained fellow surgeons, presenting 
research findings, and delivering papers at medical conferences in 
Africa and throughout the United States, often at meetings of the 
American College of Surgeons, where he became a Fellow, and for the 
National Medical Association. He was a lifelong devoted member of Zion 
Baptist Church, where he served as a trustee.
  Dr. Dargan was renowned for his knowledgeable, professional, and kind 
relationships with his patients. He was a practitioner who offered his 
patients holistic and nutritional advice, a lot of which he learned 
from his parents, both of whom grew up on rural farms, and particularly 
from his dietician mother.
  The Dargans have two daughters, Jennifer Dargan and Catherine Dargan 
Phelps; a son-in-law, Peter Phelps; and three grandchildren: Addison 
Dargan Phelps, Morgan Dargan Phelps, and Landon Dargan Phelps.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in celebrating 
the life and legacy of an incredible man and servant. Let us recognize 
Dr. Dargan&#x27;s commitment to service, sacrifices for, and contribution to 
this great Nation.
