                CELEBRATING 555 EAST&#x27;S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ROBERT GARCIA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. ROBERT GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate a Long Beach institution, 555 East, on its 40th 
anniversary this month.
  In 1983, when my hometown of Long Beach faced challenges--boarded-up 
bui]dings and a struggling economy--Sam King saw potential in our city 
and more specifically our downtown.
  On the eve of Thanksgiving that year, he signed a lease for 555 E. 
Ocean Boulevard, a decision that would change our dining landscape 
forever.
  Just months later, as the 1984 Olympics approached, 555 East opened 
its doors, introducing the prime steakhouse concept to Southern 
California.
  For four decades, 555 East has been more than just a restaurant; it 
has been a gathering place for family celebrations, business meetings, 
and everything in between.
  It has truly earned its iconic status within our community.
  I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing 555 East for its 
milestone anniversary.

                          ____________________

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Buffalo 
Niagara Heritage Village as it celebrates 55 years of exceptional work 
in preserving the agricultural history and rural heritage of the 
Buffalo Niagara region. The Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village is a 
testament to the commitment of our community to honor and interpret the 
stories that have shaped our past and continue to inform our future.
  The mission of the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village transcends 
further than preservation, as it strives to create an educational 
institution that fosters a deep appreciation for our local history. 
Visitors quickly realize that it is more than a museum--the Buffalo 
Niagara Heritage Village is a vibrant hub for learning, discovery, and 
inspiration.
  The Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village connects the rich tapestry of 
our region&#x27;s contributions to the broader narrative of American history 
and ignites curiosity while inspiring the next generation of leaders, 
artists, and custodians of our heritage. It offers hands-on experiences 
that connect visitors with the agricultural roots of our community, 
making history tangible and relevant.
  Today, as we celebrate 55 years of the Buffalo Niagara Heritage 
Village, we also look forward with hope and ambition. The museum&#x27;s 
efforts help to enhance the Western New York region by continuously 
expanding their reach, and creating even more meaningful connections 
throughout the community we cherish. Please join me in thanking the 
Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village&#x27;s organizers for their years of 
service to the public.

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th 
anniversary of the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program.
  Since 1984, the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program has 
been providing free programs to children throughout Buffalo, New York. 
The mission of the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program is 
to provide underserved children, at no charge, equal opportunities to 
engage in the highest quality programs and to offer character-building 
activities through academics, sports, and the arts. From tap/creative 
dance to chess club, the Willie Hutch Jones program provides a diverse 
foundation for all interests.
  Willie Hutch Jones obtained his Physical Education degree from 
Vanderbilt University, along with his master&#x27;s degree in Sports 
Administration from Wayne State University. These degrees partnered 
with his experience in the NBA, helped Mr. Jones grow the clinic for 
the youth of Buffalo. With the exponential growth of this program, the 
organization has been able to offer a year-round program, incorporate 
dozens of clinics, and remain free of charge.
  The Willie Hutch Jones program has strived to improve the emotional, 
social, and physical health of underserved youth by providing 
opportunities, exposure, and experiences for developing the next 
generation of community leaders. For 40 years, this organization has 
set out to impact the youth of Buffalo of all racial and socio-economic 
backgrounds, and has succeeded in doing so. The Willie Hutch Jones 
program has connected with countless organizations in the community, to 
turn the original dream into a reality.
  Today, we thank the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports 
Program, for its selfless service to our community. Please join me in 
congratulating the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program

   CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ZEKELMAN HOLOCAUST CENTER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor and celebrate the 40th 
anniversary of the Zekelman Holocaust Center, a cornerstone of 
education and remembrance in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Since its 
inception in 1984, the Center has guided countless individuals through 
the history of the Holocaust while instilling values of tolerance, 
empathy, and the importance of standing against hatred and 
antisemitism. Its commitment to preserving the memories of Holocaust 
victims and survivors is a mission of profound significance, one that 
will continue to resonate for generations to come.
  Founded on the campus of the Jewish Community Center in West 
Bloomfield and relocated to its current location in Farmington Hills in 
2004, the Center&#x27;s mission is to engage, educate, and empower visitors 
to create a better future.
  As the Zekelman Holocaust Center has grown, so has its impact. The 
Center reaches over 150,000 individuals annually through educational 
efforts, virtual museum experiences, and on-site visits. From teacher 
workshops to an extensive research library and special exhibit 
galleries, it has become a dynamic institution where visitors can 
engage with history in a deeply meaningful way.
  The Center&#x27;s exhibits have evolved over the years to elevate the 
personal experiences of survivors, capturing the strength and 
perseverance of those who came to call Michigan home, following World 
War II. Notable features include the Eternal Flame &amp; Memorial Wall and 
a Holocaust-era boxcar, both curated to ensure that the difficult 
history of the Holocaust is preserved for and transmitted to future 
generations.
  Just as it delves into some of the darkest moments of the Holocaust, 
Zekelman Holocaust Center has become a beacon of hope through its 
Kindertransport and Heroism and Hidden Gallery exhibits. These exhibits 
tell stories of immense courage and personal sacrifice that celebrate 
the extraordinary actions of ordinary people who aided Jews and rescued 
thousands of children.
  As one of only eleven sites in the United States to receive a sapling 
from the tree that grew outside of Anne Frank&#x27;s hiding place, the 
Center is able to highlight a symbol of Frank&#x27;s resilience and her hope 
that one day humanity would have another chance.
  Beyond its physical exhibits, the Zekelman Holocaust Center serves as 
a resource for understanding and combating antisemitism. The Center 
works tirelessly to educate younger generations, emphasizing the scale 
of loss and ensuring they understand the importance of standing up 
against injustice and hatred.
  As we celebrate the Zekelman Holocaust Center&#x27;s 40th anniversary, let 
us acknowledge its significant role in educating our communities, 
shaping compassionate leaders, and fostering a more just world. It is 
with deep appreciation that I recognize the Center&#x27;s contributions. May 
the Zekelman Holocaust Center continue to be a source of knowledge, 
reflection, and hope for many more years to come.

   COMMEMORATING THE BIRTHDAY OF UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS GUNNERY

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
commemorate the birthday of United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant 
John Basilone. GySgt. Basilone was a courageous and honorable Marine 
who was awarded both the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism 
during the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Navy Cross for his actions 
during the Battle of Iwo Jima. His acts of heroism left him the only 
enlisted Marine to receive both decorations during World War II. Many 
others also recognized and sought to memorialize GySgt. Basilone&#x27;s 
relentless patriotism and leadership. In 1945, the United

[[Page E1112]]

States Navy honored GySgt. Basilone&#x27;s service through the commissioning 
of the USS Basilone (DD-824) and the USS John Basilone (DDG-122), which 
will be commissioned on November 9, 2024. His hometown of Raritan, New 
Jersey began hosting the annual Basilone Parade in 1981, which 
continues to be the only annual parade in the United States that honors 
a war hero. In 2005, the United States Postal Service included GySgt. 
Basilone as one of the four distinguished Marines commemorated on the 
37-cent stamp issued on November 10, 2005. In 2010, Steven Spielberg 
and Tom Hanks adapted his story as a storyline in the HBO miniseries 
titled The Pacific. Most recently, on March 23, 2016, Congress approved 
renaming the Raritan Post Office to the Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone 
Post Office, cementing his memory in brick and mortar within his 
hometown. GySgt. Basilone has roads, bridges, and highways named after 
him in several states, and every enlisted Marine is taught about GySgt. 
Basilone&#x27;s courageous actions during their time in boot camp. It brings 
me tremendous honor to commemorate the Birthday of this American hero 
and native son of New Jersey. I would also like to recognize the 
Basilone Memorial Foundation for their tireless work honoring GySgt. 
Basilone and supporting our active military, veterans, and others in 
need. I am truly honored to represent a district home to such a hero 
and an organization that continuously works to support our Military.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a distinguished fellow 
physician and beloved friend, Dr. Robert Lee West, of Greenville, NC. 
Dr. West grew up working on his family&#x27;s farm and received his medical 
degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1959. He 
certainly left his mark on the Tarheel medical community, serving a 
year as the Chief Resident.
  After receiving his certification from the American Board of 
Pathology in 1964, Dr. West committed to serving our Nation by 
enlisting in the U.S. Army. He was assigned to Walter Reed Memorial 
Hospital, and we as a nation are forever indebted to Dr. West for his 
contributions to the health of our soldiers, as he helped establish the 
hospital&#x27;s first Clinical Research Unit.
  Following his military service, Dr. West relocated to Greenville with 
his business partner, Dr. Charles Gilbert, where he practiced for 47 
years. Together, they helped establish the Department of Pathology at 
Pitt County Memorial Hospital, providing pathological services 
throughout Eastern North Carolina. Dr. West brought his decades of 
clinical experience to educate aspiring physicians by joining the 
faculty at the ECU Brody School of Medicine in 1983. While he was a 
professor, Dr. West was recognized by Cambridge&#x27;s Who&#x27;s Who for his 
leadership in higher education.
  Upon his retirement in 2013, he was granted the title of Professor 
Emeritus and received the Clinical Faculty Development Award for the 
Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. West made remarkable and enduring 
contributions to the field of pathology at every stage of his career.
  Words do little justice when trying to fully capture the profound 
impact he had on our Nation, his community, and the medical field. Dr. 
West went to be with the Lord on September 28, 2024, leaving a void 
felt deeply by all who knew him. I hope that we can all learn from his 
legacy and strive to meaningfully contribute wherever we are, whenever 
we can, and to whomever we can, just as he did. I am honored and 
humbled to extend this chamber&#x27;s recognition to this incredible, 
faithful servant leader. May Dr. West forever rest in peace.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. SWALWELL. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the service of Special Agent 
James ``Pat&#x27;&#x27; McMonigle (Special Agent McMonigle), who retired from the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in June.
  Special Agent McMonigle felt the call to serve our country after the 
tragic loss of a colleague in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
2001. Following those events, Special Agent McMonigle devoted his 
career to the safety and security of the American people.
  During his time with the FBI, Special Agent McMonigle served in 
multiple capacities at home and abroad, including several tours 
overseas in Mogadishu, Somalia and Kabul, Afghanistan. While most of 
his career was with the FBI, Special Agent McMonigle also served as a 
field collections officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency within 
the Department of Defense.
  With degrees from Santa Clara University, Georgetown University, and 
the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Special 
Agent McMonigle is well versed in the affairs he was asked to handle. 
He is exactly who I would want during a crisis or hostage negotiation, 
deployed abroad as a legal attache, supervising human intelligence 
operations, and working on international and domestic counterterrorism.
  In addition to volunteering his time speaking with students about his 
career and encouraging them to find what drives them. Special Agent 
McMonigle also served to better the lives of his fellow agents through 
his service on the National Executive Board of the FBI Agents 
Association.
  While Special Agent McMonigle certainly hasn&#x27;t actually retired, I 
hope, with this transition, he&#x27;s able to spend more time relaxing, 
completing his wood etchings, and enjoying more of life&#x27;s milestones 
with his wife Catherine and their four children, Jack, Patrick, Maria, 
and Connor.

  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honor to recognize 
Chief Ross C. Buzzuro of the Ocean City Police Department as he retires 
after 40 years of outstanding public service.
  Chief Buzzuro led the Ocean City Police Department for over 11 years 
with purpose and dedication. As Chief, he oversaw nearly 100 full-time 
officers, around 20 civilian employees and additional seasonal and 
part-time employees.
  Throughout his nearly 40 years of law enforcement career, Chief 
Buzzuro served as a police cadet in Baltimore City in 1985 and 
eventually achieved the ranks of lieutenant, deputy major, major and 
finally being named lieutenant colonel in 2007. Chief Buzzuro is a 
graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s National Academy and 
the University of Maryland&#x27;s Fire &amp; Rescue Institute. He obtained his 
bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in management from John Hopkins 
University.
  I would like to thank Chief Buzzuro for his decades of service to the 
people of Maryland and for his work and dedication to the citizens and 
visitors of Ocean City. As he enters his well-deserved retirement and 
steps down from his position, I wish Chief Buzzuro a happy, healthy and 
exciting retirement spent around family and friends.

                          HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with Congressman Mike 
Thompson to recognize and honor Tom Bartee on the occasion of his 
retirement after an illustrious career of public service, leadership, 
and commitment to the Vallejo community and beyond. With over two 
decades of residency in Vallejo, Tom&#x27;s dedication to his community has 
made a profound and lasting impact.
  Throughout his career, Mr. Bartee served in numerous significant 
roles in the Solano County community. As District Director for Senator 
Bill Dodd, Assembly Member Mariko Yamada, and Assembly Member Michael 
Allen, Mr. Bartee worked tirelessly to represent Solano County 
Districts 4 and 7, coordinating members&#x27; engagement with their 
constituents and advocating for legislative priorities across a six-
county region. He managed district offices, engaged with community 
stakeholders from the business and education sectors, and implemented 
media strategies to keep constituents informed of legislative 
initiatives. Mr. Bartee&#x27;s leadership and coordination between district 
and Capitol offices were pivotal in serving the needs of over 470,000 
constituents, representing a legacy of responsive, engaged, and 
effective public service.
  Mr. Bartee distinguished himself through his commitment to local 
government and community engagement. Before becoming a District 
Director, Mr. Bartee served as a Solano County Field Representative for 
State Senator Patricia Wiggins and City Council Member for Vallejo from 
2005 to 2009. During his four years on the Council, Mr. Bartee 
demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the residents of Vallejo, 
working diligently to address the City&#x27;s challenges and promote its 
growth and revitalization.
  Mr. Bartee&#x27;s earlier career in the private sector included over 20 
years with General Mills, where he held various management roles and 
contributed to economic development initiatives as part of the Loaned 
Executive Program. In addition, as the owner of Manufacturing 
Management Consultants, Mr. Bartee further demonstrated his leadership 
and entrepreneurial spirit.
  Mr. Bartee&#x27;s contributions extend beyond his professional roles to 
his active involvement in the Vallejo Main Street Program, the Vallejo 
Chamber of Commerce, and the Downtown Central Core Restoration 
Corporation (CCRC), where he serves as Vice President. He is also known 
for his work as a host and producer with VERBA and VCAT, providing a 
platform for local dialogue and community engagement. Tom&#x27;s commitment 
to community development, revitalization, and engagement has left an 
enduring mark in Vallejo.
  Mr. Bartee&#x27;s legacy of integrity, leadership, and service will 
continue to inspire those who had the pleasure of working with him. On 
behalf of the constituents of California&#x27;s 4th and 8th Congressional 
Districts, we wish Mr. Bartee the best wishes in his well-earned 
retirement and extend our sincere gratitude for his countless years of 
service to the community.

    PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY WITH PSYCHEDELICS ADVANCING 
                            THERAPIES (PATH)

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JACK BERGMAN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record an 
updated open letter from myself and Congressman Correa. the founders of 
the PATH Caucus, to ensure stakeholders have a voice in crafting the 
rules and regulations surrounding psychedelic assisted treatments. This 
is an updated version of the letter from my previous submission to the 
Record on August 9, 2024. It serves to extend our requested deadline 
for responses to February 28, 2025.

       Dear Commenter: In 2022, a new Congressional caucus was 
     created to raise awareness among federal lawmakers about the 
     therapeutic potential of psychedelic and entactogenic drugs 
     to treat several mental health conditions that were 
     refractory to contemporary evidence-based therapies. The 
     Congressional Psychedelics Advancing Therapies (PATH) Caucus 
     aimed to accelerate and support clinical research in the use 
     of these novel substances, specifically psilocybin and 3,4-
     methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).
       To better inform Congressional members, the bipartisan PATH 
     Caucus is seeking input on how to implement programs and 
     policies that address the range of complex issues with 
     potential novel therapies that may use a psychedelic or 
     entactogenic drug in medically supervised and interpersonally 
     supportive settings.
       To gain a more complete understanding of the issues 
     associated with use of these substances, the PATH Caucus 
     believes that taking an inclusive, intentional, and reasoned 
     approach to gathering input from the public may engender 
     valuable insights that can more accurately and 
     comprehensively characterize how different modalities 
     incorporate the use of these substances while also ensuring 
     responsible, accountable, safe, and ethical use. We seek 
     information from the general public, those who have received 
     psychedelic-assisted therapies as an intervention, interested 
     stakeholders, and those individuals and entities working 
     within the bio-psycho-social-spiritual behavioral health 
     ecosystem (e.g., palliative care, addiction services), which 
     stresses a holistic system of care comprised of clinical 
     providers, counseling, and peer support (Courtney et al., 
     2023; D&#x27;Souza, 2007; Urutia et al., 2023).
       It will be essential to receive input from people and 
     organizations with specialized experience in implementing 
     therapies where psychedelic or entactogenic drug substances 
     are administered, such as in clinical research protocols 
     (e.g., depression, palliative care, substance use disorders, 
     post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)), or experience in 
     training others for such therapies. As a part of the PATH 
     Caucus information gathering effort, we acknowledge the 
     significant anthropological role of certain psychedelic 
     substances such as ayahuasca, peyote, and Psilocybe 
     mushrooms. Some indigenous peoples of the Americas have 
     extensive traditions dating back hundreds to thousands of 
     years, where they incorporated these substances into 
     spiritual ceremonial or ritual healing practices. The PATH 
     Caucus believes that respectful, inclusive, cultural 
     knowledge sharing from these communities may provide 
     substantial insights, further informing our overall 
     understanding, and we welcome their input.

[[Page E1113]]

       In medications derived from psychedelic or entactogenic 
     drug substances are ultimately approved for therapeutic 
     indications by the FDA, it is important for States to 
     understand the risk mitigations frameworks FDA has 
     established and develop ways to make sure they are supported. 
     Aspects of real-world risk reduction and mitigation 
     frameworks may include, but are not limited to, providing 
     comprehensive transparent public education, implementing 
     substance misuse prevention programs, minimizing the 
     potential for adverse reactions, and developing implementable 
     risk mitigation, safety, and ethical monitoring strategies. 
     Moreover, it will be vital to consider how Congress can best 
     support states in developing and adopting scalable 
     infrastructures and sustainable service delivery systems that 
     ensure proper accountability and monitoring, as well as 
     facilitate access and equity in utilization, with a 
     particular focus on communities that may be at risk for 
     experiencing inequities in care resulting in disparate health 
     outcomes (e.g., veterans, the uninsured, those who are 
     experiencing homelessness, people with lower incomes, and 
     individuals living with mental illness and/or co-occurring 
     substance use disorders; Ortiz et al., 2022). In addition, 
     when federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans 
     Affairs make these products available, we need to be sure 
     there is sufficient infrastructure to ensure patient safety. 
     All of these components, when collectively addressed, may 
     contribute to more responsible, accountable, safe, and 
     ethical use of psychedelic and entactogenic derived 
     substances in medically supervised and interpersonally 
     supportive settings.
       The PATH Caucus seeks input that can inform Congress so any 
     potential future appropriations will support states 
     collectively addressing the relevant issues and support 
     necessary federal initiatives such as research, 
     implementation and FDA regulation. Congress believes that by 
     listening and learning from the broader ecosystem, staying 
     abreast of potential innovative evidence-based therapies that 
     may treat individuals with behavioral health disorders 
     refractory to current treatment modalities, and 
     simultaneously undertaking proactive measures for developing 
     real-world risk reduction and mitigation frameworks, will 
     help protect public health and safety.


    Current State of Psychedelic and Entactogenic Clinical Research

       Clinical data continue to be collected regarding the safety 
     profiles and potential benefits from therapies that use 
     psychedelic or entactogenic drug substances across a variety 
     of diagnoses such as major depressive disorder (MDD), 
     treatment resistant depression (TRD), demoralization, PTSD, 
     generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and substance use 
     disorders, in conjunction with appropriate supervision and 
     support from qualified mental health professionals (Belouin 
     et al., 2022; Carhart-Harris et al., 2021; Davis et al., 
     2021; Griffiths et al., 2016; Jerome et al., 2020; Mitchell 
     et al., 2021; Ross et al., 2016; Siegel et al., 2021; Xi et 
     al., 2023). Additionally, FDA has granted requests for 
     Breakthrough Therapy designation to specific development 
     programs involving MDMA for the treatment of PTSD 
     (Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies, 2017), 
     psilocybin for TRD (COMPASS Pathways, 2018; Goodwin, G.M.. et 
     al. 2022) and MDD (Khan, 2019; Raison et al., 2023), CYB003 
     for MDD (Cybin, 2024), and MM120 (lysergide d-tartrate) for 
     GAD (MindMed, 2024). The Breakthrough Therapy designation 
     process facilitates and expedites the development and review 
     of certain new drugs that have the potential to address unmet 
     medical needs. This designation is available for drugs that 
     are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease 
     or condition and where preliminary clinical evidence 
     indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial 
     improvement over available treatments on clinically 
     significant endpoint(s) (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 
     2022). It should be noted that a Breakthrough Therapy 
     designation does not mean that the FDA has made a safety or 
     efficacy determination for a drug, and the Breakthrough 
     Therapy designation is not a substitute for marketing 
     approval. Currently, FDA has not approved any drug containing 
     MDMA, psilocybin, psilocybin analogs, or LSD or other 
     psychedelics or entactogens as being safe and effective for 
     any therapeutic indication(s).


            Acknowledging the Need to Address Complex Issues

       Use of these substances is not without risk. A psychedelic 
     (e.g, psilocybin) or entactogenic (e.g., MDMA) drug can 
     temporarily alter a person&#x27;s mood, thoughts, and perceptions, 
     and lead to heightened suggestibility, anxiety/panic, and/or 
     paranoia, among other outcomes. For psychedelics, a 
     participant can experience vast changes in their perceptions 
     of reality, including time and space. Moreover, an individual 
     can become extremely sensitive to internal and external 
     stimuli and altered in their cognitive functioning and 
     visuoperceptual skills. Knowing these realities, any therapy 
     that uses psilocybin or MDMA, for example, should involve 
     thorough participant screening, education, and preparation, 
     supportive settings, and close supervision by credentialed 
     and qualified medical and mental health professionals to 
     maximize safety and promote potential therapeutic outcomes 
     (Davis et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2008; Nichols, 2016; 
     Phelps, 2017).
       Furthermore, acknowledging that it has been suggested that 
     some therapies could potentially lead to blurring of ethical 
     boundaries between participants and provider(s) in some 
     cases, as well as the potential for enhanced suggestibility, 
     there might be increased risk for serious intimate ethical 
     boundary violations by session facilitators/monitors, 
     including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse (Anderson, 
     B., Danforth, A., Grob, C., 2020; Goldhill, 2020; Pilecki et 
     al., 2021), though psychedelics and entactogens are by no 
     means unique in this regard. Some populations might have a 
     higher risk for adverse reactions from psychedelic or 
     entactogenic drugs, such as people with a known history of 
     serious cardiac conditions or serious mental conditions such 
     as borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder 
     (Bender and Hellerstein, 2022; Bradberry et al., 2022; 
     Leonard et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2012; Malcolm and Thomas, 
     2021).
       Given the broad array of potential challenges with 
     therapies that may use psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) or 
     entactogens (e.g., MDMA), compounded by an absence of 
     consensus about how best to address these challenges, a 
     proactive collaborative approach may be most effective, where 
     a partnership of subject matter expertise can consolidate 
     efforts and collectively work to address relevant issues 
     (Belouin et al., 2022; Belouin and Henningfield, 2018; Xi et 
     al., 2023). Best practices good, credentialling, et.


                      Information Being Requested

       This letter seeks broad input to address five major 
     landscape domains that may contribute to developing real-
     world risk reduction and mitigation frameworks that protect 
     public health and safety when considering implementing 
     potential therapies that use a psychedelic or entactogenic 
     drug substance in medically supervised and interpersonally 
     supportive settings. These include: (1) service delivery, (2) 
     promoting participant protections, (3) engagement of 
     communities, (4) safeguarding equitable access, and (5) best 
     practices for data standards.
     Service Delivery
       What is the spectrum of interdisciplinary practitioners who 
     will be held accountable as session facilitators/monitors for 
     the potential use of these substances in medically supervised 
     and interpersonally supportive settings?
       Training considerations
       What are the minimal training standards for integrated care 
     delivery?
       What curriculum is needed that best addresses variations in 
     psychotherapy (e.g., how best to address a participant&#x27;s 
     vulnerability and manage psychedelic-related challenging 
     experiences)?
       Credentialing considerations
       What are the relevant background education, qualifications, 
     professional experiences, and potential examinations that 
     might be considered for interdisciplinary credentialing?
       Which disciplines may represent `service providers&#x27; (e.g., 
     clinical practitioners, counselors, peer support)?
       What might be appropriate supervision and practice hour 
     requirements?
       What types of guidance documents may be necessary for those 
     who provide close supervision/monitoring of participants 
     using psychedelics or entactogens?
     Promoting Participant Protections
       Provide input on strategies that may be critical to 
     protecting participants, including:
       What strategies will be needed to ensure participant 
     education, screening for medical or mental health conditions 
     that may disqualify from participation, and informed consent 
     prior to an individual participating in a therapy that may 
     use a psychedelic or entactogenic drug substance?
       What is needed to assess baseline pre-dose and adverse 
     event monitoring post-dose (e.g., suicidal ideation or 
     behavior, physiological reactions, psychological harm, 
     substance misuse, and drug-drug interactions)?
       What information is available or needed on how medically 
     supervised and interpersonally supportive settings might 
     incorporate substance misuse screening and prevention, risk 
     mitigation, safety and ethical monitoring strategies that 
     protect participants from potential ethical boundary 
     violations from providers?
       What components need to be developed to support ethical-
     vigilance reporting systems (e.g., state departments of 
     consumer protection, professional societies, state licensing 
     bodies, and law enforcement)?
       What data might be collected that improves existing 
     pharmacovigilance reporting systems?
       How will these strategies complement existing patient 
     protection regulations enforced by FDA that reduce risk for 
     clinical trial participants as well as for users of approved 
     and regulated products?
     Engagement of Communities
       The PATH Caucus invites input to help identify best 
     mechanisms/approaches that achieve engagement with diverse 
     communities, including:
       How might some indigenous people&#x27;s use of psychedelics 
     (e.g., ayahuasca, peyote) as sacraments in spiritual 
     ceremonial or ritual healing practices, improve our 
     understanding to protect public health and safety?
       How might we ensure engagement with vulnerable populations 
     disproportionately affected by mental health conditions, 
     including people experiencing homelessness, racial/ethnic 
     minorities, sexual and gender minorities, older adults, 
     people living with disabilities and chronic health 
     conditions, and individuals in the criminal justice system 
     (Ortiz et al., 2022)?

[[Page E1114]]

       Are there examples of best practices that facilitate 
     provider (e.g., clinical practitioners, counselors, and peer 
     support) engagement with vulnerable populations?
       How do we effectively navigate societal stigma associated 
     with psychedelic or entactogenic use?
       How do we effectively educate healthcare, local crisis 
     response systems, and law enforcement?
       How do we best engage in comprehensive transparent 
     community educational outreach?
     Safeguarding Equitable Access
       What should be considered critical elements to the 
     development of capabilities across the following domains or 
     activities?
       Reimbursements that ensure equitable access to services.
       Healthcare economic impact analyses.
       Types of medically supervised and interpersonally 
     supportive therapy settings.
       Collaboration on activities that may include input on 
     prescribing, administering, and dispensing.
       Manufacturing and distribution standards.
       Supporting oversight of the available supply of substances.
       Diversion control monitoring.
       Information on how potential psychedelic and entactogenic 
     medicinal use might fit within the medication use process and 
     workflow of health care systems.
       How should these activities be performed in a manner that 
     complements and supports FDA&#x27;s regulation of development, 
     manufacturing, distribution, marketing and use of 
     psychedelics?
     Best Practices for Data Standards
       What types of data standards and repositories (e.g., 
     Coordinated Registry Networks) may be created to collect data 
     that continually informs best practices and vice versa?
       How might current surveillance systems of regulated and 
     unregulated settings be improved?
       For example, Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-
     Related Surveillance (RADARS), Monitoring the Future, 
     National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the Drug Abuse 
     Warning Network, collect actionable data on psychedelic and 
     entactogenic use; associated adverse events; prevalence of 
     medical and non-medical use; frequency, dose, and use 
     settings; and participant comorbidities, health concerns, 
     long-term effects, as well as demographic characteristics.
       Please email your input and feedback to PATH@mail.house.gov 
     by close of business on February 28, 2025. Your responses to 
     these questions are crucial, as they will directly inform 
     Congress on how best to contribute to protecting public 
     health and safety, acknowledging the complex nature of issues 
     associated with these novel therapies that use psychedelic or 
     entactogenic substances in medically supervised and 
     interpersonally supportive settings. We aim to ensure the 
     path we walk is illuminated for all Congressional members 
     where they can make informed decisions on the relevant 
     issues.

  RECOGNIZING GOODWILL OF COLORADO&#x27;S EXCEL CENTER IN AURORA, COLORADO

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JASON CROW

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 
recent opening of Goodwill of Colorado&#x27;s Excel Center in Aurora, 
Colorado.
  The Excel Center is dedicated to advancing educational opportunities 
for adults in our state and aims to empower adult learners to achieve 
the foundational credential of a high school diploma.
  As Colorado&#x27;s first in-person, no-cost, adult learning high school, 
the Excel Center will provide a pathway for residents aged 22 years and 
older to earn a diploma--setting them up for higher earning potential 
and improved job security.
  Equipping students with the tools and support they need to overcome 
obstacles to academic progress is one of the main priorities of the 
Excel Center. By working to break down these obstacles, including 
childcare and transportation, Goodwill of Colorado will help students 
pursue their educational goals.
  Colorado, like much of the Nation, faces a critical workforce 
shortage, particularly in high-demand industries requiring skilled 
workers. Adult learners at the Excel Center will be connected with the 
education resources, certificates, and workforce development they need 
to enter the workforce and contribute to in-demand fields.
  My district, our state, and our Nation are better when we invest in 
our workforce, create opportunities for growth, and empower our 
communities. I congratulate Goodwill of Colorado on the opening of the 
Excel Center and thank them for their service to our community.

                  RECOGNIZING METRA&#x27;S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, November 5, 2024

  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise today to commemorate 
the 40th anniversary of Metra Commuter Railroad.
  Since its establishment, Metra has been an integral part of the 
transportation network that connects riders with their workplace, 
community, and loved ones throughout Chicagoland. Metra operates the 
Nation&#x27;s largest commuter rail system, as measured by route miles, 
including 11 rail lines and 243 stations throughout the Chicago 
metropolitan region, a region that covers more than 3,700 square miles.
  Throughout Metra&#x27;s impressive expansion, Metra&#x27;s dedication to the 
communities it serves has been unwavering. As the United States 
Representative for Illinois 8th Congressional District, I am proud of 
my strong relationship with Metra and will continue working with them 
on improving services, as well as securing funding for projects of 
critical importance to my constituents.
  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Illinois and elsewhere, 
ridership across every mode of public transportation decreased 
significantly. The rise of remote and hybrid work meant fewer people 
commuting each day, leaving transit systems with ridership 
approximately 40 percent below pre-COVID levels. This decreased 
ridership had a direct impact on farebox revenue, a major source of 
funding for transit operations. In the Chicago region, beginning in 
late 2025 and early 2026, transit operators like Metra will face a $730 
million annual budget gap. I remain committed to addressing the transit 
fiscal cliff--an issue that will not only impact Illinois transit 
systems but also the majority of transit systems operating across the 
Nation.
  I would also like to extend my congratulations to Metra&#x27;s CEO and 
Executive Director, Jim Derwinski, on being named as Chair of the 
Surface Transportation Board&#x27;s Passenger Rail Advisory Committee. 
Finally, I would like to recognize the tireless work of Metra&#x27;s 
employees, from the ticket agents to the train conductors. Their work 
is essential to fulfilling the critical transportation needs of our 
communities.
  I thank Metra for 40 years of service. I look forward to their 
continued success, and many more years of growth.

  Mr. ROBERT GARCIA of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor an 
extraordinary institution in my district, Musical Theatre West, a 
premier musical theater company celebrating 72 years in business and 27 
years since they moved to my hometown of Long Beach.
  What began in 1952 as the Whittier Civic Light Opera has blossomed 
into one of Southern California&#x27;s most respected theatrical production 
companies. From humble beginnings performing in a high school 
auditorium, they have grown to produce a full season of shows at the 
Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center, showcasing both 
classic staples and contemporary favorites.
  Their commitment to artistic excellence has not only enriched our 
cultural landscape but has also nurtured countless homegrown talents 
who have gone on to shine on Broadway and beyond.
  Musical Theatre West&#x27;s commitment to accessibility has introduced 
audiences of all ages and classes to beloved productions, reaching 
demographics who may have not been otherwise exposed to the art of 
musical theater.
  But most importantly their dedication to education reaches over 
17,000 children yearly through outreach programs, sharing the magic of 
musical theater with the next generation.
  Let us celebrate Musical Theatre West for its remarkable journey, its 
lasting impact on our community, and for showcasing the power of the 
performing arts to inspire and uplift.
