               CELEBRATING 120 YEARS OF THE IRIS NETWORK

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. CHELLIE PINGREE

                                of maine

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable 
organization in my state that has been providing essential services and 
advocacy for individuals with vision impairment and blindness for 120 
years. The Iris Network is one of Maine&#x27;s oldest and most respected 
nonprofit agencies, known for its

[[Page E756]]

steadfast commitment to accessibility, independence, and empowerment.
  Founded in 1905 as the Maine Institution for the Blind, with the 
support of Helen Keller, the organization initially focused on teaching 
trades to help blind and visually impaired individuals enter the 
workforce. Over time, its mission has evolved to offer comprehensive 
training programs that meet people where they are--equipping them with 
the skills and confidence to live independently. These programs cover a 
wide range of daily life skills, from kitchen safety to technology use. 
The Iris Network offers services at its Portland facility and travels 
throughout the state to support individuals in their homes. Further, 
they offer holistic guidance to assist organizations businesses, and 
employers in making their environments welcoming and equitable. Their 
dedication to accessibility can be found in every aspect of their work.
  In addition to its training programs, The Iris Network operates a 
thriving residential community. In 2006, they opened Iris Park 
Apartments, a Level I assisted living facility that now serves over 
thirty residents. Iris Park offers a safe, supportive, and empowering 
environment where technology is thoughtfully integrated, appliances are 
adapted with sensory guides, and community-building activities--like 
braille bingo--foster connection and independence.
  The Iris Network exemplifies the positive impact that comes from 
uplifting others. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to The Iris Network 
for 120 years of dedicated service and for improving the lives of 
countless Mainers. Their leadership, compassion, and unwavering 
commitment to accessibility deserve our deepest admiration and 
commendation.

         CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF MARY JANE COURTRIGHT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
extraordinary constituent from my district, Mrs. Mary Jane Courtright. 
Born on August 7, 1925, Jane exemplifies a century of steadfast 
dedication to education, family, and community service. Her 100 years 
of life stand as a powerful testament to a life lived in service to 
others.
  Jane&#x27;s commitment to education was evident early on. She graduated 
first in her class from Camden Catholic High School and was awarded a 
full scholarship to Georgian Court College. There, she earned a 
bachelor of science in chemistry in 1946 while also serving as senior 
class vice president, in addition to participating in a plethora of 
other clubs and student activities. She went on to earn two master&#x27;s 
degrees, one in science education and another in chemistry.
  For over 25 years, Jane taught chemistry at Council Rock High School. 
As the only female educator in the school&#x27;s science department at the 
start of her career, she pioneered the implementation of the AP 
chemistry program--a program that continues to flourish today.
  In 1950, Jane married Joseph Albert Courtright and supported his 
service in the U.S. Navy, living in Philadelphia, Pearl Harbor, and 
Port Hueneme before settling in Warminster, Pennsylvania. After her 
husband&#x27;s passing in 1958 while in the service of his country, Jane 
raised their five children with unwavering devotion and grace. Her 
strength and love built a family that now spans seven grandchildren and 
ten great-grandchildren.
  Beyond her roles as an educator and a mother, Jane served as the 
President of the Federated Women&#x27;s Club of Warminster. Notably, she 
spearheaded a community initiative to create a lending library. By 
placing collection cartons in local grocery stores for donated books, 
Jane amassed an extensive collection of literature. Jane&#x27;s initiative 
eventually grew into the Warminster Township Free Library, which today 
boasts over 100,000 volumes of literary works. Jane served as both 
president and treasurer of the Founding Library Board of Directors, 
volunteering for 54 years.
  Jane actively practiced her faith as a parishioner and volunteer at 
Nativity of Our Lord Catholic Church in Warminster. In her service to 
the parish, Jane saw a need and organized Nativity&#x27;s program to provide 
religious instruction for public school students. She served as 
principal of the new CCD program for several years and continued as a 
volunteer instructor for many more.
  Now, as she approaches age 100, Jane remains an extraordinary force--
focusing on her personal fitness with her trainer Sabrina Willard, who 
helped in her recovery from cancer and with whom she has now worked for 
the past 24 years.
  As we celebrate Jane&#x27;s 100th birthday, we honor her enduring 
dedication to Bucks County as an educator, community servant, loving 
mother, and an inspiring woman of remarkable strength and character.

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and celebrate the 
Land of Make Believe, an amusement park that has been an important 
landmark of the Hope Township, New Jersey community, for over seven 
decades. Since its founding in 1954 by Herman Maier, the park has 
remained family-owned and operated, with the Maier family upholding the 
same high standards of excellence and service that have defined it from 
the beginning. Today, Christopher Maier, Herman&#x27;s son and the park&#x27;s 
current owner, attributes its enduring success to a commitment to 
affordability, safety, and family-centered fun. As we mark the park&#x27;s 
71st anniversary, I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring this 
beloved institution and its legacy. I look forward to seeing it 
continue to bring joy to generations of families for years to come.

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lifelong service 
of Commissioner Dwight Penland of Clay County. Mr. Penland is the 
longest-serving commissioner in Clay County history, with a tenure of 
nineteen years. Before his time on the Board of Commissioners, Mr. 
Penland served eight years on the Clay County Board of Education. In 
total, Commissioner Penland has spent 27 years at the helm of local 
public policy in Clay County, serving as a voice of reason and 
unyielding advocate for his community.
  Mr. Penland grew up in Bell Creek, a community in Clay County. The 
youngest of five sons to father JD Penland and mother Hazel Penland, 
Mr. Penland graduated from Hayesville High School in 1978, where he 
volunteered as the middle school girls&#x27; basketball coach. Even at a 
young age, Mr. Penland&#x27;s passion and commitment to serving the children 
of Clay County is evident. He went on to become a successful local 
businessowner in Hayesville, where he served the needs of his customers 
and helped grow the Clay County economy. Commissioner Penland and his 
wonderful wife, Leonia ``Sissy&#x27;&#x27; Penland, have two grown children, 
Jarrod and Jadrian.
  Clay County has achieved remarkable milestones under Commissioner 
Penland&#x27;s leadership, including the construction of a new courthouse, 
public health department, Department of Social Services, and Department 
of Transportation facility to enhance government administration. 
Additionally, Commissioner Penland oversaw the construction of a new 
sheriff&#x27;s office, detention center, Emergency Medical Services 
building, 911 call center, recreation center, primary school, and 
Veterans Park to ensure the health, safety, and wellbeing of Clay 
County residents.
  On behalf of the people of Clay County and Western North Carolina, I 
thank Commissioner Penland for his lifelong service to our wonderful 
home and our deserving people.

    HONORING THE FLEMINGTON JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER ON THEIR 100TH 
                              ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Flemington Jewish 
Community Center (FJCC), which is marking the celebration of its 100th 
anniversary as a cherished spiritual and cultural home in Hunterdon 
County, New Jersey. Since its founding, the FJCC has exemplified the 
spirit of community, service, and faith: principles that have guided it 
to its position as a flourishing center of Jewish life and learning.
  The history of the FJCC stretches back to the early decades of the 
twentieth century, when a wave of Jewish farmers, inspired by the 
promise of opportunity and liberty from oppression, found their way to 
Hunterdon County. 1922 marks the founding of the Hebrew Citizens 
Congregation of Hunterdon County, the brief precursor to today&#x27;s 
Flemington Jewish Community Center.
  The FJCC&#x27;s earliest permanent home was a small house on Park Avenue 
in Flemington, which was remodeled to suit the religious and cultural 
needs of its growing membership. During these formative years, the 
congregation&#x27;s devotion to community and Jewish life was evident not 
only in weekly services and holiday observances, but also in robust 
cultural activities. Furthermore, as the world plunged into the Second 
World War, the Center turned its attention outward, raising funds for 
defense bonds and organizing to support displaced Jewish populations 
worldwide. The congregation&#x27;s compassion, resourcefulness, and 
generosity established the Center as a moral beacon in Flemington and 
beyond.
  In the post-war period, the FJCC renewed efforts to build a larger 
and more modern facility--a vision realized through a new synagogue on 
East Main Street, which was dedicated in 1948. Under the steady 
guidance of religious leaders like Rabbi Maurice Idell, and later Rabbi 
Evan Jaffe, the FJCC&#x27;s mission expanded even further. Hebrew classes, a 
Ladies&#x27; Auxiliary, youth activities, and vibrant cultural programs 
created a profound strength of community.
  As the congregation continued to thrive, it outgrew its Main Street 
home and, in 2006, celebrated the completion of a new 23,000-square-
foot facility in Raritan Township. Under the guidance of Rabbi Eric 
Cohen, dedicated officers, staff, and volunteers, the congregation has 
embraced this modern space. From its Nursery and Hebrew Schools to 
adult education and dedicated interfaith outreach and charitable 
engagements, the FJCC stands today at the head of Jewish life in 
Hunterdon County, and reaches members from Trenton to Princeton, and 
from Annandale to Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
  As the earliest members hoped a century ago, the FJCC today is far 
more than a synagogue--it is a true community center. It provides a 
welcoming atmosphere for families on Friday evenings, Torah discussion 
on Saturdays, and learning opportunities for youth and adults alike. It 
brings together individuals of all backgrounds, reflecting the 
pluralism and mutual respect that are hallmarks of both American 
democracy and Jewish tradition. May it continue to be a sanctuary where 
tradition thrives, learning flourishes, and community guides 
generations to come. On this 100th anniversary, I extend my heartfelt 
congratulations to the Flemington Jewish Community Center.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Leonardo 
``Flaco&#x27;&#x27; Jimenez who passed away on Thursday, July 31, 2025. A pioneer 
of Conjunto music, his music powerfully defined the arts. He brought 
generations together through his one-of-a kind talent. He is survived 
by his wife, Adela, his eight children, and his brother, Santiago 
Jimenez, Jr.
  A San Antonio native, Mr. Jimenez was born into a family of 
musicians. He was the grandson and son of trailblazing accordionists 
who encouraged ``Flaco&#x27;&#x27; to pursue music. He played with his father&#x27;s 
band as a child, launching a career that spanned more than seven 
decades.
  As ``Flaco&#x27;&#x27; began to master the accordion, he soon packed Texas&#x27; 
dance halls at a young age. His performances captivated audiences and 
spread throughout the country. His incredible talent led to 
collaborations with notable musicians who dominated the air waves. 
These collaborations exposed regions across the country and world to 
the Conjunto sound.
  ``Flaco&#x27;&#x27; was an international ambassador of Conjunto music, and by 
extension, Mexican-American culture. Everywhere he performed, the 
rhythm from his accordion did more than move the crowd. It exposed 
people to the Mexican-American ethos. The shared stories of hope, love, 
perseverance and triumph touched and shaped the soundtrack of American 
life.
  The power in ``Flaco&#x27;s&#x27;&#x27; music forged a legacy defined by success, 
With albums such as eAy Te Dejo en San Antonio y Mas!, and hits like 
``Margarita, Margarita&#x27;&#x27; and ``(Hey Baby) Que Paso,&#x27;&#x27; he received many 
prestigious accolades. ``Flaco&#x27;&#x27; became a 6-time Grammy Award Winning 
artist and received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015. His 
album, Partners, was inducted into the National Recording Registry at 
the Library of Congress in 2021. He also received various hall of fame 
inductions and lifetime awards.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate the life and legacy of a 
Conjunto and Tejano music icon who will long be remembered in my 
hometown, across the State of Texas, and around the world.

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Villareal 
Johnson, Sr. Villareal was a District of Columbia native, military 
veteran and dedicated civil servant. He passed on July 7, 2025, in the 
District of Columbia.
  From a young age, Villareal had an interest in military service and 
saw himself fighting for what was right. Villareal followed his 
interests and joined the military, where he served in Vietnam and 
Operation Desert Storm. In 2013, Villareal retired from military 
service with the Sergeant First Class rank, after serving in the Army, 
Army Reserves, and D.C. National Guard, as Military Police. After his 
retirement from military service, Villareal, like his father, began a 
career in the civil service, working as an investigator for the Child 
Support Division of Office of the D.C. Attorney General.
  Villareal&#x27;s dedication to service extended beyond his work. In his 
spare time, he tirelessly served his community as Boy Scout troop 
leader for Minnesota Ave. Troop No. 1202, where he shared his passions 
for the outdoors with his scouts and taught boys wilderness survivals 
skills. In addition to his passion for the outdoors, Villareal was also 
passionate about do-it-yourself projects and the arts, as he was an 
artist, poet and writer.
  Villareal&#x27;s selflessness and dedication to both D.C. and our Nation 
should be recognized. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible life and legacy 
of Villareal Johnson, Sr.

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Evergreen Fire/
Rescue for receiving the Mission Lifeline Emergency Medical Service 
Gold Award from the American Heart Association for a third consecutive 
year.
  This prestigious award recognizes agencies with an outstanding 
ability to quickly recognize a heart attack or stroke and provide high-
quality care. In these high-pressure cardiac situations, timely care 
from an EMS team can be the difference between life and death.
  Since 2014, Evergreen Fire/Rescue (EFR) has been honored with this 
award four times. EFR Chief Dave Montesi attributes the team&#x27;s success 
to their experienced paramedics, most of whom have more than 20 years 
of experience in the field. Evergreen&#x27;s rural geography presents unique 
challenges in emergency situations, as the local hospital is located 
miles away from most residents. EFR&#x27;s quick responses consistently make 
a real difference when other help isn&#x27;t always readily available, and 
we are grateful for their lifesaving service to our community.
  On behalf of the people of Colorado&#x27;s Seventh Congressional District, 
it is my honor to congratulate Evergreen Fire/Rescue on their 3rd 
consecutive Mission Lifeline EMS Gold Award. We thank them for the 
exceptional care they provide to the people of Evergreen and the 
countless lives they have saved.

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and pleasure to extend 
heartfelt congratulations to the congregation of First African Baptist 
Church in Columbus, Georgia, as they celebrate a remarkable 185 years 
of faith and community. This great occasion will be marked by a 
celebration at the church on Sunday, August 10, 2025, at the church in 
Columbus.
  Founded in 1840 by enslaved individuals in the antebellum South, 
First African Baptist Church began in a building located at the corner 
of Third Avenue and Twelfth Street, just a few blocks from the 
Chattahoochee River. This sanctuary was previously used by First 
Baptist Church, which was established in 1829 as Columbus&#x27;s first 
church.
  Although founded by enslaved people, First African Baptist Church was 
initially pastored by white ministers during its first twenty-two 
years. Demonstrating a spirit of love and acceptance for all, 
regardless of race, the church welcomed anyone in Columbus seeking to 
worship. By 1858, the church had baptized 731 members--390 white and 
341 black.
  Throughout its history, the church relocated three times to 
accommodate a growing congregation alongside the development of 
Columbus. Its second location was a frame building at the corner of St. 
Clair and Front Streets, now known as Eleventh and Front. In 1881, the 
Georgia General Assembly granted land at Eleventh Street and Sixth 
Avenue, leading to the church&#x27;s renaming as Six Avenue Baptist Church. 
This site is now occupied by Golden Foundry and Machine Company.
  The current church home, located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 
Ninth Street, was established in 1915, at which time the church adopted 
its name, First African Baptist Church. Today, as we celebrate its 
185th Anniversary, the legacy of this congregation stands as a 
testament to its resilience and commitment to faith. Over the years, 
the church has undergone several renovations, reflecting its evolving 
mission. Under the leadership of Reverend Roderick B. Green and his 
dynamic wife and First Lady, Lynn Hall-Green, First African Baptist 
Church continues to grow, driven by a vision of holistic transformation 
and continual improvement in Christ.
  The scripture tells us in Matthew 16:18 that Jesus said, ``Upon this 
rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail 
against it.&#x27;&#x27;
  The story of First African Baptist Church, which began with a small 
group of devoted worshipers 185 years ago, is truly inspiring. It 
embodies the dedication and perseverance of a congregation that has put 
its love and trust in the Lord through both joyful and challenging 
times.
  Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring First 
African Baptist Church in Columbus, Georgia, for its rich history of 
faith, unity, and service to the community, as they continue to come 
together to worship our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

  Mr. HARDER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
opening of The Cambodian Experience: Our Journey to America, Finding 
Freedom at the Haggin Museum in Stockton, California. This exhibit 
documents the experiences of Cambodian Americans, tracing their journey 
from the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime to refugee resettlement 
and community building in the United States.
  Developed and curated by the United Cambodian American Network 
(UCAN), a nonprofit organization based in Stockton, the exhibit 
presents a comprehensive narrative through oral histories, archival 
materials, artifacts, and multimedia storytelling. It highlights the 
contributions of Cambodian Americans and underscores the role of 
refugee communities in the broader American story.
  Stockton, which became a major resettlement site during the 1980&#x27;s 
and 1990&#x27;s, is home to one of the largest Cambodian communities in the 
United States. This exhibit reflects the significance of the city as 
both a destination and a foundation for Cambodian American life.
  Key contributors include Sophy Reese, President of UCAN and project 
manager; collaborating organizations such as the Khmer Language Arts 
and Culture Academy and A Khmer Buddhist Foundation; and survivors and 
descendants who provided firsthand accounts and materials for display. 
The Haggin Museum provided exhibition space, curatorial support, and 
logistical coordination for the project.
  This exhibit is the fourth in a continuing series of Cambodian 
cultural exhibits presented in partnership with the Haggin Museum. It 
serves both as a remembrance of a difficult history and a testament to 
cultural preservation, community strength, and intergenerational 
resilience.
  I commend the individuals and organizations whose efforts have 
resulted in this important public exhibit and recognize its role in 
fostering historical understanding and cultural appreciation.

        RECOGNIZING THE VILLAGE OF TONTOGANY&#x27;S SESQUICENTENNIAL

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 8, 2025

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Village of 
Tontogany&#x27;s Sesquicentennial. The perseverance of pioneers and settlers 
to overcome come the challenges faced during the early years of the 
village&#x27;s history has persisted throughout the past 150 years. The hard 
work and spirit shown by generations of village residents have made 
Tontogany an outstanding example of American ingenuity.
  Tontogany&#x27;s long history dates back to the first settlers to settle 
in the area, Samuel and Eliza Hamilton. The village&#x27;s name comes from 
the Ottawa Native American Chief Tondoganie. When it was officially 
incorporated in 1895, the town was an agricultural village, populated 
by farmers. Keeping with the village&#x27;s small town charm, the original 
village hall built in 1898 is still used today. In 1900, The 
Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Railway depot was constructed, allowing 
the village to continue its agricultural commerce. In 1958, Tontogany 
became the home of the newly formed Otsego Local School District which 
was formed when the state pushed for smaller districts to merge.
  Mr. Speaker, by celebrating the 150th Anniversary of the Village of 
Tontogany, community members recognize the outstanding

[[Page E758]]

achievements, maintain the pioneer attitude, and strive to better their 
village through the principles on which it was founded. I thank and 
congratulate Tontogany on this significant milestone.
