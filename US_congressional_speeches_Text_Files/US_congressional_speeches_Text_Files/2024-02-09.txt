                 CELEBRATING JAMES BLANTON&#x27;S RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL CLOUD

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, February 9, 2024

  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the retirement of 
James Blanton after his incredible 35 years in law enforcement.
  James&#x27; journey started in 1989 as a Patrol Sergeant and Criminal 
Investigator for the Caldwell County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, where he 
played an important role in the CAPCO Drug Task Force and solidified 
his reputation as a trusted law enforcement professional. His career 
brought him through a variety of roles, including Investigator for the 
Bastrop County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, Deputy for the Comal County 
Sheriff&#x27;s Department, and Deputy Constable for Precinct 2 in Hays 
County.
  In each and every assignment, James&#x27; integrity and professionalism 
stood out among his colleagues--leading to a decorated career. Most 
notably, James has been awarded with the Master Peace Officer 
classification by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, recognizing 
his excellence in the field. But more than any award or career 
achievement, James is known for his character, and his respect for all 
individuals he encountered during his service. His unwavering 
commitment to serving his community marks truly a job well done, and a 
life well lived.
  As James embarks on this new chapter of his life, it is my honor to 
recognize his remarkable service and dedication. I join the communities 
James has served in thanking him for his years of service. May God 
bless him and his family in the months and years ahead.

proud matriarch of her loving family, and someone who still takes every 
opportunity to give back to others. Martha and her late husband, Henry, 
raised their two daughters in Sinton and have been blessed with five

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor the career and accomplishments of Ann Marie Miller, a committed 
advocate for the arts, as she marks the closing of a 28-year career 
tenure that has shaped the art sector within New Jersey. Raised in East 
Brunswick, Ann Marie Miller was inspired by a strong high school arts 
program to become an art teacher. She graduated from Moore College of 
Art and Design with a Bachelor of Science in arts education and taught 
visual art in both public and private settings.
  Her 28-year journey has been nothing short of extraordinary, leaving 
an indelible mark on the cultural tapestry of New Jersey. I applaud Ann 
Marie&#x27;s dedication and she has most definitely made a significant 
impact in the arts community.
  I wish Ann Marie a peaceful retirement filled with joy, relaxation 
and cherished moments spent with loved ones.

  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor the life of Jane A.

state of Idaho. The passing of Jane on October 25, 2023, after bravely

insatiable curiosity and love for life. She graduated from Platte High 
School in 1973 and went to pursue her passion of Horticulture at Kansas 
State University, earning her BS degree. Jane furthered her education

Courses from Harvard University&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government in 
addition to the Library of Congress&#x27;s Staff Training courses,
  In pursuit of her dreams, Jane relocated to Weiser, Idaho, where she 
found fulfillment with her career and community. She was instrumental 
in establishing the first Young Republicans chapter in Payette County, 
showing her dedication to civic engagement and leadership.
  Throughout her life, Jane radiated positivity and joy, even in the 
face of adversity. Despite her battle, she continued to find joy by 
being surrounded by family. Jane will be dearly missed by her husband, 
Brent Olmstead, children Tyler Gorsuch, Katie Gorsuch, stepsons Jacob 
Olmstead, Berkley Olmstead, and Murphy Olmstead, siblings John 
Wittmeyer, Mary Andra, and Mark Wittmeyer. She was preceded in death by

  Ms. BUSH. Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today to honor the 
exceptional career of Ms. Vivian Martain. Ms. Martain is retiring at 
age 81 after spending over five decades working to service our St. 
Louis community.
  Ms. Martain&#x27;s commitment to service is evident in each of her 
pursuits. Since 2018, she has served as the Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion Compliance Officer and Project Pave Administrator at 
Millstone Weber. In 2019, Ms. Martain became Millstone Weber&#x27;s first 
Civil Rights Compliance Manager, where she worked to ensure that 
minority contractors were represented on the massive I-270 North 
Project. Prior to that, she served a 14-year term as Executive Director 
of the Construction Prep Center.
  As the chief architect of Millstone Weber&#x27;s Project PAVE Initiative, 
she strived to guide, educate, and support students in North St. Louis 
County high schools and encourage them to pursue careers in heavy 
design, engineering, and construction. Ms. Martain fondly recounts 
stories of every single student and how each of them excelled after 
being in the program.
  Ms. Martain has committed her professional life to serving the people 
of Missouri, and her retirement signifies a well-deserved reprieve from 
her tireless service. The impact of Ms. Martain&#x27;s work is immeasurable. 
We thank her for an unwavering dedication to public service and 
congratulate her on an outstanding career.

IMPEACHING ALEJANDRO NICHOLAS MAYORKAS, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY, 
                    FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, February 6, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, extreme MAGA Republicans 
have engaged in a cynical and unserious attempt to impeach Homeland 
Security Secretary Mayorkas. Their report to accompany H. Res. 863 
resorted to sloppy misrepresentations in an attempt to justify this 
baseless, political stunt.
  For example, the report misquoted Professor Frank Bowman, who 
testified before the Committee on Homeland Security on January 10, 
2024. Professor Bowman testified that the Constitution did not support 
the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas over mere policy differences. The 
majority report, however, twists a passage of Professor Bowman&#x27;s book 
on impeachment and uses it out of context to suggest policy differences 
were grounds for impeachment.
  Republicans also tried to misrepresent Professor Bowman&#x27;s writings 
during the hearing, but they did not afford Professor Bowman an 
opportunity to explain his work. I submitted clarifying questions to 
Professor Bowman to supplement the hearing record, but the majority did 
not transmit those questions to Professor Bowman before the legislative 
report was filed in the House.
  I include in the Record Professor Bowman&#x27;s responses to my questions 
to make the professor&#x27;s thoughts on impeachment over policy differences 
abundantly clear, since the Republican majority cannot be bothered to 
conduct a proper investigation with a complete record.

     Committee on Homeland Security, U.S. House of Representatives


                  Responses to Supplemental Questions

  Frank O. Bowman III, University of Missouri Curators&#x27; Distinguished 
Professor Emeritus, Floyd R. Gibson Missouri Endowed Professor Emeritus

    (Academic titles provided for identification purposes only. The 
opinions expressed herein are those of the author, do not reflect those 
 of any other person or entity, and are not endorsed by the University 
                             of Missouri.)

       Question #1 from Mr. Thompson: Republicans have portrayed 
     your previous academic writing as confirming their position 
     that mere policy differences may be a ground for impeachment. 
     In particular, that ``displeasure with administration 
     personnel and policy&#x27;&#x27; may be sufficient to warrant 
     impeachment. Is that correct?
       I have never written that mere policy differences would be 
     an adequate ground for impeachment. To the contrary, I join 
     with the consensus view of constitutional scholars that 
     ordinary policy differences are not a proper ground for 
     impeachment. Indeed, this general principle is particularly 
     applicable to a disagreement on policy between a presidential 
     administration and a political party controlling only one 
     house of Congress, and that by the very narrowest of margins.
       The quotation to which the question alludes, one mentioned 
     by Chairman Green and Rep. Bishop, occurs in the final 
     paragraph of Chapter 4 of the second edition of my book, High 
     Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age 
     of Trump (Cambridge Univ. Press 2023). Both congressmen take 
     the snippet of text they quote entirely out of context.
       In the referenced section of Chapter 4, I discuss the only 
     prior impeachment of a U.S. cabinet officer, President 
     Ulysses Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War, William Belknap. Prior to 
     the quoted passage, I explained why no cabinet officer before 
     or after Belknap has been impeached. The primary, and 
     obvious, reason is that, as I wrote, any cabinet officer 
     ``whose behavior veered anywhere near an impeachable zone&#x27;&#x27; 
     was simply removed by the President. Which is what happened 
     to Belknap. He took a bribe. When President Grant found out, 
     he fired Belknap. But the House, controlled by Democrats for 
     the first time since the Civil War, impeached the Secretary 
     anyway as a means of politically damaging President Grant and 
     by extension the Republicans in the upcoming 1876 election.
       In the final paragraph of Chapter 4, I was, of course, not 
     saying that mere ``displeasure&#x27;&#x27; with either a person or a 
     policy is a constitutionally acceptable ground for 
     impeachment. Rather, when a subordinate official has actually 
     committed ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and 
     misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27;

[[Page E131]]

     (as Secretary of War Belknap incontestably did), Congress 
     might elect to proceed with impeachment to signal its 
     displeasure.
       Secretary Mayorkas has not committed any impeachable 
     offense. Impeaching a cabinet officer innocent of ``treason, 
     bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27; to indicate 
     displeasure with administration policy or the officer&#x27;s 
     administration of that policy would be a profoundly anti-
     constitutional act.
       Question #2 from Mr. Thompson: In the past, you have 
     written that impeachable ``high crimes and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27; can 
     be interpreted to include ``serious executive misconduct, 
     including . . . betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy 
     interests&#x27;&#x27; such as when a president subordinates the 
     nation&#x27;s interests to foreign interests. Republican Rep. 
     Guest suggested that you have written in the past about 
     foreign policy differences as grounds for the first 
     impeachment of President Trump--what you describe as Trump&#x27;s 
     ``rolling destruction of American foreign policy&#x27;&#x27;--and that 
     your past writing contradicts your testimony at the January 
     10, 2024, hearing. Are foreign policy differences an 
     impeachable offense, and how do foreign policy differences 
     differ from ordinary policy differences?
       I have written that one of the accepted historical 
     categories of impeachable conduct, in both the pre-1787 
     United Kingdom and in the United States, has been ``betrayal 
     of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests.&#x27;&#x27; However, in 
     saying this, I was obviously not saying that ordinary policy 
     differences between a presidential administration and the 
     opposing political party become impeachable simply because 
     the subject matter of the disagreement is foreign, rather 
     than domestic, policy.
       To the contrary, long precedent establishes that, in the 
     U.S. impeachment context, ``betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign 
     policy interests&#x27;&#x27; has had certain identifying features.
       First, for impeachment purposes, a nation&#x27;s ``foreign 
     policy interests&#x27;&#x27; are not merely the transient preferences 
     of a political party or faction. Rather, they are enduring 
     interests about which there is a broad societal consensus, 
     ideally one embodied in statutes, treaties, the practice of 
     multiple presidential administrations, and (where applicable) 
     the views of a nation&#x27;s diplomats, foreign policy experts or 
     professionals.
       Second, the word ``betrayal&#x27;&#x27; implies, not merely changing 
     policy or adopting policy views contrary to one&#x27;s political 
     adversaries, but subverting the national interest for 
     illegitimate, often personal, motives.
       British impeachments that illustrate these features include 
     the following.
       In 1667, after an expensive and unnecessary war with the 
     Dutch, the Earl of Clarendon was impeached in part for 
     seeking payments from France to the British crown to evade 
     parliamentary controls on royal finance.
       In 1678, the Earl of Danby was impeached for soliciting--on 
     behalf of the English King Charles II--a bribe from Louis XIV 
     of France in return for English neutrality in the Franco-
     Dutch War.
       Both Clarendon and Danby&#x27;s solicitations not only undercut 
     longstanding British foreign policy objectives and subjected 
     the British monarch to undue foreign influence, but were a 
     bald attempt to avoid a significant parliamentary constraint 
     on royal overreach--the requirement that the Crown obtain 
     ``supplies&#x27;&#x27; (i.e., funding in addition to the monarch&#x27;s 
     private wealth) through the legislature.
       More relevant to the present case are the American 
     impeachments of Senator William Blount in 1797-98 and of 
     President Donald Trump in 2020.
       Sen. William Blount: Blount, then a U.S. senator, concocted 
     a scheme to enrich himself by giving Great Britain control of 
     the territories of Louisiana and Florida. Blount&#x27;s scheme was 
     obviously contrary to contemporary U.S. foreign policy 
     interests inasmuch as the American government and populace 
     wanted to expand into Louisiana and Florida, or at the very 
     least to prevent Great Britain from assuming control over 
     those territories. In addition, the articles of impeachment 
     against Blount charged him with violations of the Neutrality 
     Act of 1794, and also with violation of the Treaty of 
     Friendship, Limits, and Navigation between the United States 
     and Spain (because his scheme involved stirring up Native 
     American tribes to attack Spanish officials and interests).
       Not only was Blount&#x27;s scheme undeniably contrary to U.S. 
     foreign policy interests, and to multiple treaty obligations, 
     but it was a ``betrayal&#x27;&#x27; in the most obvious sense. Blount 
     tried to sell out the interests of his country for personal 
     financial gain.
       Although Blount was acquitted by the Senate, the historical 
     consensus is that the verdict turned on the decision that 
     senators are not ``civil officers&#x27;&#x27; subject to the 
     impeachment remedy under Article II, Section 4 of the 
     Constitution.
       President Donald Trump:
       President Trump&#x27;s first impeachment involved two articles, 
     the first charging that Trump committed ``high crimes and 
     misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27; in relation to his scheme to coerce the 
     government of Ukraine into announcing investigations into 
     Trump&#x27;s likely presidential opponent, Joe Biden, and the 
     second charging obstruction of Congress. The first article 
     was captioned ``Abuse of Power,&#x27;&#x27; but as I have written, it 
     ``braided together three themes . . . corruption, damage to 
     foreign policy interests, and injury to the democratic 
     process. As the first article of impeachment summarized the 
     matter:
       ``President Trump abused the powers of the Presidency by 
     ignoring and injuring national security and other vital 
     national interests to obtain an improper personal political 
     benefit. He has also betrayed the Nation by abusing his high 
     office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic 
     elections.&#x27;&#x27;
       The ``national security and other vital national 
     interests&#x27;&#x27; alluded to in the article were the interest of 
     the United States in supporting, militarily and 
     diplomatically, a country threatened, and indeed physically 
     invaded, by Russia, a longstanding geopolitical opponent of 
     the United States, together with the interest of the United 
     States in preventing Russian territorial expansion up to the 
     borders of the countries of the NATO alliance.
       These objectives had been endorsed as national security 
     interests of the United States over multiple presidential 
     administrations through repeated bipartisan approval of 
     legislation authorizing military and security aid to Ukraine. 
     They were also endorsed by the entire diplomatic and national 
     security apparatus of the U.S government before and during 
     the Trump Administration itself. For example, when Trump&#x27;s 
     White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) placed a 
     hold on congressionally mandated aid to Ukraine in the July 
     2019 as part of President Trump&#x27;s scheme to coerce Ukraine, 
     every relevant agency of Trump&#x27;s own administration except 
     OMB questioned the hold and supported military assistance to 
     Ukraine as being in the national security interest of the 
     United States.
       Thus, Trump&#x27;s first impeachment precisely matches the 
     template for ``betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy 
     interests&#x27;&#x27; described above.
       First, the foreign policy interests of the United States in 
     that case were enduring interests embraced by multiple 
     presidential administrations, endorsed by the foreign policy 
     professionals of the executive branch, and manifested in 
     bipartisan legislation enacted by multiple U.S. congresses.
       Second, and critically, the ``betrayal&#x27;&#x27; of U.S. interests 
     consisted of subverting the national interest for 
     illegitimate personal motives--securing a personal political 
     advantage over a potential political rival. In Trump&#x27;s case, 
     the betrayal was doubly severe because it amounted to an 
     effort to use presidential power to corrupt the democratic 
     electoral process.
       Secretary Mayorkas: Nothing alleged against Secretary 
     Mayorkas meets the traditional criteria for impeachment based 
     on ``betrayal of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests.&#x27;&#x27; The 
     most that can be said against him is that he has executed the 
     policy preferences of President Joe Biden in relation to 
     immigration and border control issues and that the political 
     party in control of the House of Representatives disapproves 
     of those policy preferences. There is no indication that the 
     Secretary&#x27;s actions, or indeed the Biden Administration&#x27;s 
     policy choices, are contrary to established national foreign 
     policy interests. To the contrary, U.S. policy regarding 
     immigration and border control has varied from administration 
     to administration and congress to congress as the challenges, 
     needs, and preferences of the country have varied. More 
     importantly, there is absolutely no indication that Secretary 
     Mayorkas has taken any official action for corrupt or 
     illegitimate personal motives.
       To repeat the central point, ordinary policy differences 
     between a presidential administration and the opposing 
     political party do not become impeachable simply because the 
     subject matter of the disagreement is foreign, rather than 
     domestic, policy.
       Question #3 from Mr. Thompson: Rep. Crane suggested that 
     Secretary Mayorkas has betrayed the Nation, and that betrayal 
     of the nation would be sufficient to warrant impeachment. Are 
     you aware of any evidence that Secretary Mayorkas has 
     betrayed the United States? And Rep. Crane further suggested 
     that you said ``betrayal of the Nation&#x27;&#x27; is a potential 
     ground for impeachment, whereas you actually said ``betrayal 
     of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests&#x27;&#x27; is a ground for 
     impeachment. What precisely did you mean?
       I did not say in my testimony to the Committee or elsewhere 
     that that ``betrayal of the nation&#x27;&#x27; is a ground for 
     impeachment. I have agreed with Charles Black that one decent 
     definition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27; that covers 
     most cases is offenses ``which are extremely serious, which 
     in some way corrupt or subvert the political and governmental 
     process, and which are plainly wrong in themselves to a 
     person of honor, or to a good citizen, regardless of words on 
     the statute books.&#x27;&#x27; Nothing alleged against Secretary 
     Mayorkas meets this general definition of impeachable 
     conduct.
       I have also written that one specific category of 
     impeachable ``high crimes and misdemeanors&#x27;&#x27; is ``betrayal of 
     the nation&#x27;s foreign policy interests.&#x27;&#x27; In my previous 
     answer, I explain what is meant by that phrase for purposes 
     of impeachment and I demonstrate why Secretary Mayorkas&#x27; 
     conduct does not fall within it.
       Finally, I am aware of no evidence that Secretary Mayorkas 
     has betrayed the nation. To the contrary, based on the facts 
     of which I am aware, Secretary Mayorkas appears to be a 
     capable, dedicated public servant trying as best he can to 
     carry out the policy priorities of the President of the 
     United States and to manage the perennial and intractable 
     problems related to immigration and control of the U.S. 
     southern border.

                  RECOGNIZING AMERICA&#x27;S CREDIT UNIONS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEN CALVERT

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, February 9, 2024

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of 
credit unions in the competitive financial services marketplace. I 
especially appreciate the 263 credit unions and their 14 million 
members in my state of California.
  The country&#x27;s two storied trade associations, the Credit Union 
National Association and the National Association of Federally-Insured 
Credit Unions are now merged into a new organization called ``America&#x27;s 
Credit Unions.&#x27;&#x27;
  As a long-time credit union member and supporter, I appreciate the 
difference between credit unions and banks. Credit unions are not-for-
profit financial cooperatives that are democratically controlled.
  Every member, regardless of how much they have in savings or loans at 
a credit union, has an equal voice and vote in the governance of their 
credit union. There are no outside stockholders and no motive for the 
credit union&#x27;s leadership to gouge the membership or provide poor 
member service.
  In fact, credit unions consistently rank as the most popular form of 
depository institutions in America. So today I congratulate the 
unification of the two national credit union advocacy organizations and 
I expect great things to come from this newly-minted trade organization 
called ``America&#x27;s Credit Unions.&#x27;&#x27;

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. PAUL A. GOSAR

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, February 9, 2024

  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the good work of a 
Phoenix-based veterans care facility called Phoenix Oasis. Phoenix 
Oasis, headed by its Director Anthony Pfeffer, demonstrated its 
commitment to our veterans and offered key assistance to U.S. Vets-
Phoenix. When U.S. Vets lost its lease, but did not yet have a new 
facility ready, Phoenix Oasis stepped in and allowed U.S. Vets to 
continue serving veterans. U.S. Vets stayed and offered services to 
veterans for months after the lease had expired, and in that way, 
Phoenix Oasis allowed veterans in need to have continuity of care in a 
stable and supportive environment.
  Indeed, Mr. Pfeffer prioritized providing assistance to U.S. Vets 
notwithstanding the needs of his own program at Phoenix Oasis. The 
veterans served by U.S. Vets benefitted tremendously by this 
compassionate effort and the sacrifices made by Phoenix Oasis and Mr. 
Pfeffer.
  It is commendable that Mr. Pfeffer and Phoenix Oasis take their 
responsibilities to our veterans so deeply and personally. It is rare 
these days to see that level of commitment and I applaud them in so 
doing.
  It is also the 10th anniversary of the founding of Phoenix Oasis. The 
dedicated staff at Phoenix Oasis have provided a decade of service 
delivering safe housing and substance abuse treatment services to 
thousands of veterans during that time. And they did so with dignity 
and respect to our veterans.
  Our veterans helped America when we needed them. When our veterans 
need help, people like Mr. Pfeffer and Phoenix Oasis step in. I thank 
them on behalf of everyone they have helped in the last decade.

 RECOGNIZING THE MILITARY SERVICE OF TECHNICAL SERGEANT FRANK L. PIFHER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JACK BERGMAN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, February 9, 2024

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Technical 
Sergeant Frank L. Pifher for his dedicated and humble service to our 
Nation in the United States Army.
  Frank, a Flint, Michigan, native answered our Nation&#x27;s call and 
enlisted in United States Armed Forces in 1952. Frank served honorably 
in the Korean War in 1953 with the Armored Cavalry, seeing combat as a 
Tank Commander and spending 11 months overseas. He earned the Korean 
Service Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, the Good Conduct Medal, 
the United Nations Service Medal, and the National Defense Service 
Medal in gallant service to his country.
  After returning stateside, Frank was stationed at Camp Carson in 
Colorado, where he was honorably discharged from the Army on May 5th, 
1954. While overseas, Frank had frequently written to a pen pal, who 
was serving as a wartime nurse back in Michigan. Upon his separation 
from the military, Frank married his beloved pen pal, Mary Lou. In 
their 70 years of marriage, they had four children--Tim, Janet, Rebecca 
and James. Rebecca and James went on to serve honorably in the Marine 
Corps themselves. In addition to their children, Frank and Mary Lou 
were blessed with five grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, two 
great-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren. The Pifhers 
currently reside in Tuscarora Township where they have lived for 34 
years.
  Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;d like to thank Technical Sergeant Frank L. Pifher for 
his exemplary service to the United States of America. Our gratitude 
extends to him not only for his courage and humility, but also for his 
legacy of service that he has passed down to his children and their 
children. May God bless Frank and his family.

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MELANIE A. STANSBURY

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, February 9, 2024

  Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Veronica 
Krupnick of Santa Fe, New Mexico, who was selected by Casey Excellence 
for Children Awards to receive the 2024 Alumni Award. Veronica is the 
first Indigenous person to have been selected for this great honor. She 
is an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe of Arizona and has Jemez Pueblo 
and Navajo Nation heritage.
  Veronica is a mentor, a leader, and an unwavering advocate for 
children and youth in New Mexico&#x27;s child welfare system. Drawing upon 
her own experience in the foster care system, Veronica&#x27;s advocacy and 
mentorship centers around the importance of connecting children and 
youth in the child welfare system to their cultural identities, 
communities, and traditions. Last year, she played a crucial role in 
upholding the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), which was under threat 
by a case heard before the Supreme Court. The ICWA mandates that when 
the government seeks foster and adoption placement for a child who is a 
member of or eligible for membership in an Indian Tribe, it must give 
preference to those with kin or Tribal relationships to the child. In 
the decades since it was enacted, the ICWA has been labeled the gold 
standard of child welfare policy. This law consistently establishes 
best practices to protect Indigenous children and preserve the 
integrity of Indigenous cultures and identities.
  Veronica currently serves as the Leadership Analyst for the Majority 
Leader in the New Mexico House of Representatives. In addition, she is 
the Vice President of the Board of Directors of Court-Appointed Special 
Advocates for Children (CASA), First Judicial District, a senior member 
of the National Foster Youth and Alumni Policy Council, a member of the 
National Child Welfare and Racial Equity (CWARE) Collaborative, and the 
Co-Chair of the Training Committee for the New Mexico Partners.
  Veronica works tirelessly to give a voice to children and youth in 
Tribal families, and in New Mexico as a whole, that are impacted by the 
child welfare system. I would like to thank Veronica for working every 
day as a champion to instill hope in our future generations.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, February 9, 2024

  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Jason Howard, U.S. Army, 
Retired, has always been there to lend a helping hand to his fellow 
citizens and his efforts to make his beloved community a better place 
has made lasting and positive impacts on the region. He is a dedicated 
soldier, devoted public servant, and a fitting recipient of a 
Congressional Veteran Commendation.
  SGT Howard has extensive military experience including serving at 
Fort Cavazos and deployments in both Operation Enduring Freedom and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. He worked closely with our Kurdish allies and 
even met with future Iraqi President Jamal Talabani. His great work 
didn&#x27;t go unnoticed as he was awarded a Bronze Star Medal, Army 
Commendation Medal, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and among 
others.
  After retiring from the Army, SGT Howard found his way back to 
Central Texas. Fueled by his passion for wanting to serve and lead 
others, SGT Howard serves as the Alderman for the Village of Salado 
while giving back to his community through numerous volunteer 
opportunities. He pours himself into making Salado a great place to 
work and call home, all while ensuring that the voices of residents are 
heard in the halls of government. His actions reflect the commitment of 
a devoted public servant. Once a soldier, always a soldier.
  I commend SGT Howard&#x27;s incredible contributions. This soldier-for-
life&#x27;s patriotism, citizenship, and commitment to excellence reflect 
the very best of Central Texas. I join his colleagues, family, and 
friends in honoring his career, commending his commitment to public 
service, and celebrating his outstanding achievements.
