                       HONORING DR. MICHAEL ROUSE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the lifelong 
service of Dr. Michael Rouse, a man whose dedication to ministry, 
education, and the advancement of Christian values has had a profound 
impact not only in Alabama, but across the Nation.
  Dr. Rouse&#x27;s commitment to faith and education is evident in his 
academic achievements. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Baptist 
Bible College, followed by a master&#x27;s degree in pastoral ministries, 
and a doctorate in theology from Bethany Seminary. These 
accomplishments laid the foundation for his more than forty years of 
devoted service as the senior pastor of Mountain View Baptist Church in 
Birmingham, Alabama. Through his leadership, this church has been a 
beacon of faith and community in our state.
  Beyond his pastoral duties, Dr. Rouse has been a leader in Christian 
education. In 1982, he founded Mountain View Baptist School, providing 
generations of students with a strong academic foundation rooted in 
biblical principles. His influence in education extended further 
through his twenty-five years of service as both vice president and 
president of the Alabama Christian Education Association.
  Additionally, from 2016 to 2024, he served faithfully as the 
president of the American Association of Christian Schools, guiding 
Christian educational institutions across the country with wisdom and 
steadfast dedication.
  Dr. Rouse&#x27;s contributions to our communities, our schools, and our 
faith institutions cannot be overstated. His lifelong efforts have 
strengthened families, empowered students, and enriched the spiritual 
and educational fabric of Alabama and beyond.

                          ____________________

          HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MRS. REBA W. STEWART

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
a dedicated wife, committed mother, loving grandmother, trailblazing 
bank executive, benevolent community servant, giving neighbor, and dear 
friend of longstanding, Mrs. Reba W. Stewart. Sadly, Reba passed away 
on June 7, 2025. A graveside service to celebrate her remarkable life

[[Page E555]]

will be held on Tuesday, June 10, 2025, in Albany, Georgia.
  Reba was born to the union of the late Ola Mae and Warnell Willis in 
Albany, Georgia. She was a proud graduate of Albany High School and the 
Georgia Banking School.
  Mrs. Stewart dedicated thirty-seven and a half years to Citizens and 
Southern Bank, now known as Bank of America. She was subsequently 
employed at SunTrust Bank for twenty-six years. A true trailblazer, 
Reba became the first female banking officer and the first female 
branch manager in Albany during her time at Citizens and Southern Bank.
  It has been said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space 
that we occupy here on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; Reba paid her rent, and she paid 
it well. She was committed to giving back to the community that had 
nurtured her for so long. Her sense of pride for Albany propelled her 
into many leadership roles with various social and civic organizations 
including serving as past Chairperson of the Board of Directors for the 
American Heart Association, Albany YMCA, SOWEGA Council on Aging, and 
the Boys and Girls Club of Albany. She played pivotal roles in 
fundraising to build the Chapel at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital and 
helping to construct the new church at Byne Memorial Baptist Church of 
Albany. Additionally, she contributed her talents to the Foundation 
Boards of Darton College and Albany State College (now university), as 
well as the Board of Directors of SunTrust Bank. Reba&#x27;s dedication to 
her community was further demonstrated through her membership in the 
Dougherty County Kiwanis Club.
  Throughout her life, Mrs. Stewart received numerous accolades that 
reflect her profound impact on the community. Among these are Albany&#x27;s 
Woman of the Year, the Golden Deed Award from The Exchange Club of 
Albany, the Woman of Distinction Award from the Girl Scouts of America, 
and the Woman of the Youth Award from the Boys and Girls Club of 
Albany.
  Guided by her strong faith, she was a devoted member of Byne Memorial 
Baptist Church. Reba cherished her church and her church family for 
seventy-three years. She actively participated in various church 
activities, generously reaching out to the community through mission 
efforts.
  On a personal note, Reba was my dear friend and neighbor for many 
years. She always greeted me with a warm smile and sometimes not so 
subtle advice. She never told me what I wanted to hear, but she always 
told me what she felt I needed to hear. I will be forever grateful for 
the fidelity of her friendship and the timbre of her character.
  Reba accomplished much in life but none of it would have been 
possible without the love and support of her beloved late husband of 
sixty-two years, Emmett; her daughter, Leslie Stewart Sullivan; her two 
grandchildren Clay and Mary Stewart Sullivan and a host of other 
relatives and friends.
  Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I along with the more than 765,000 
people of Georgia&#x27;s Second Congressional District, salute and honor the 
life of Mrs. Reba W. Stewart. I ask my colleagues to join us in 
extending our deepest condolences to her family and all who mourn her 
loss during this difficult time of bereavement. I pray that they will 
be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in 
the days, weeks and months ahead.
  Mrs. Reba W. Stewart leaves behind a legacy of love, service, and 
dedication to family and community. Her influence will be felt for many 
years to come, and she will be deeply missed.

                          ____________________

      HONORING THE SERVICE OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL DANIEL BLACKLEDGE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ZACHARY NUNN

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant 
Colonel Daniel Blackledge for his more than two decades of service in 
the United States Air Force. A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy 
and a proud leader within the intelligence community, Lt. Col. 
Blackledge has represented our Nation with distinction in uniformed 
service across the globe.
  From his early days as an intelligence officer to his most recent 
assignment as a Legislative Liaison to the Secretary of the Air Force, 
Lt. Col. Blackledge has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the 
security and strategic readiness of our Nation. His operational 
leadership has taken him from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam to RAF 
Molesworth, to deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan--always delivering 
with precision, integrity, and focus.
  Over the course of his career, Lt. Col. Blackledge served in pivotal 
roles at the Pentagon, U.S. Strategic Command, and in multiple joint 
environments. His work has helped shape national policy and defense 
priorities, particularly through his most recent role advising Air 
Force leadership and Congress on programs vital to our military&#x27;s 
intelligence gathering, communications, and battlefield awareness 
capabilities.
  As he enters retirement, we also recognize the enduring support of 
his family. His wife, Captain Katie Blackledge, is a fellow veteran and 
airman in her own right, and together they have raised two exceptional 
daughters, Laurel and Lane Blackledge. Their shared sacrifice and 
steadfast support have been essential to Daniel&#x27;s service, and our 
Nation owes them a debt of gratitude as well.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Lieutenant 
Colonel Daniel Blackledge for his outstanding service to our country 
and in wishing him and his family continued success in this next 
chapter.

               NEWSLETTER FROM CONGRESSMAN CHUCK EDWARDS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents on Helene recovery, 
Chatuge Dam repair, and protecting consumer choice.

     Dear Friend,

       News outlets thrive on controversy, and nothing grabs 
     attention like conflict.
       Since coming to Congress, my colleagues on both sides of 
     the aisle have come together to pass more than 430 bills and 
     amendments, but that doesn&#x27;t make for entertaining news.
       To stir up conflict, news outlets often create a black hole 
     of information by limiting views or regularly misrepresenting 
     or ignoring them.
       If the media is a driving force behind division, it must 
     also be part of the solution. You can read my full discussion 
     on media bias here.


               Clearing debris from waterways post-Helene

       The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) continues to work 
     diligently to clear debris from many of our waterways after 
     Hurricane Helene.
       I appreciated the opportunity to receive an update on their 
     progress and share a few of the concerns that I&#x27;ve been 
     hearing from our community, including the need for debris 
     removal efforts to be mindful of endangered and threatened 
     species and to avoid removing healthy vegetation from the 
     streambanks.
       USACE&#x27;s methodical approach to debris removal has 
     facilitated the clearing of over 3.4 million cubic yards of 
     debris, giving the natural environments that have been 
     reshaped by Helene the opportunity to heal.

[[Page E553]]

       The Corps shared that they were not just removing debris 
     for the short-term. Instead, they have been focused on the 
     long-term health of the region by implementing a zero-
     tolerance policy for over-cleaning or reckless removal of 
     debris.
       While we can all acknowledge that there are times when the 
     Corps has missed the zero-tolerance mark, our conversation 
     made it clear that we are both committed to working together 
     to make sure that our streams and rivers are cleaned the 
     right way, so they can return to being safe, healthy, and 
     free of debris for decades to come.


               Tax deadlines extended for Helene victims

       The IRS is extending various tax deadlines to Sept. 25, 
     2025 for folks located in areas affected by Hurricane Helene.
       If you need assistance navigating issues with the IRS, my 
     district office is available to help. Visit my website at 
     edwards.house.gov/services/federalagency.


     Ensuring safety and economic security along the Hiwassee River

       Western North Carolina, with its many lakes and rivers, 
     must remain at the forefront of dam safety.
       With the recent vulnerabilities found in the Chatuge Dam, 
     it is critical that safety risks are addressed to protect 
     lives and downstream communities in our mountains. That said, 
     the Hiwassee River is foundational to the rural, westernmost 
     areas of our district&#x27;s recreation industry and economy. That 
     is why I have requested that the Tennessee Valley Authority 
     (TVA) provide the risk analysis and data behind their 
     decision to move forward with repairs and improvements.
       The people of Western North Carolina deserve to know why 
     repairs are needed if we are going to come to an educated 
     opinion on the best path forward. It&#x27;s imperative that the 
     condition of the dam, the safety of the community downstream, 
     and the economic security of the businesses and people 
     surrounding the dam be considered when evaluating the best 
     approach to addressing the safety concerns.
       My office will continue to work with local and federal 
     officials to determine the best path forward, while 
     strengthening the long-term viability of the dam so that our 
     local economy can thrive.
       TVA is early in their process of analyzing potential 
     solutions and impacts, and anyone interested in the decision-
     making process can attend in-person or virtual public input 
     sessions. The dates and times for these sessions can be found 
     on their website here.


         Myth Buster: MS-13 gang member of ``Maryland father&#x27;&#x27;?

       There are folks who have been up in arms about an MS-13 
     gang member, whom some have dubbed as a ``Maryland man,&#x27;&#x27; 
     claiming that he has been ``mistakenly&#x27;&#x27; deported to El 
     Salvador.
       Let&#x27;s be clear: Deporting him was NOT a mistake.
       There has been a deportation order for Abrego Garcia since 
     2019, when an immigration court and an appellate immigration 
     court both ruled that he was a member of MS-13 and in our 
     country illegally.
       When MS-13 was declared a foreign terrorist organization, 
     Abrego Garcia became no longer eligible for any form of 
     immigration relief in our country.
       This is just another example of hand-picked information 
     errantly fueling public outrage. Not only should journalistic 
     institutions prioritize factual, balanced reporting over 
     sensationalism, but we as citizens must also take 
     responsibility for looking at the facts rather than 
     retreating into ideological bubbles.


            Protecting consumer choice from radical mandates

       You may have heard of California&#x27;s electric vehicle (EV) 
     mandate to ban the sale of gas-powered cars, which is the 
     latest attempt to force an extreme agenda that would take 
     away consumer choice, lead to higher prices for both new and 
     used cars, and strain our electric grid.
       Such a ban would affect consumers in every state in our 
     country by raising costs and decreasing availability of gas 
     vehicles.
       The assertion that EVs are affordable and highly sought 
     after is out of touch with reality: only 1 percent of 
     registered vehicles in the U.S. are EV&#x27;s.
       I voted for three resolutions that passed the House to push 
     back on such radical policies from the prior administration 
     and repeal these disastrous mandates:
       House Joint Resolution 88 would repeal California&#x27;s waiver 
     allowing the state to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 
     2035.
       House Joint Resolution 87 would repeal California&#x27;s waiver 
     allowing the state to require the sale of zero-emission 
     trucks.
       House Joint Resolution 89 would end California&#x27;s nitrogen 
     oxide engine emission standards, which create unrealistic 
     standards for heavy-duty on-road engines.
       The U.S. has reduced emissions for decades through wise 
     investment and innovation, not extreme government mandates. 
     Congress must protect consumer choice and stop California 
     from circumventing the federal government&#x27;s environmental 
     regulations, to the detriment of consumers and the automobile 
     market nationwide.


          Bringing the federal government to folks across WNC

       In keeping with my office&#x27;s motto of being ``First in 
     Constituent Services&#x27;&#x27; and helping folks after Hurricane 
     Helene, my office regularly brings the Carolina Cruiser 
     across our mountains for mobile office hours.
       In April alone, the Carolina Cruiser made 16 stops where 
     members of my team heard about the issues that matter to WNC 
     communities, answered questions about disaster recovery, and 
     assisted with federal agencies. During these office hours, my 
     team heard from over 150 individuals.
       As your congressman, it is my goal to remain accessible to 
     you. In addition to mobile office hours, I regularly host 
     ``Chat With Chuck&#x27;&#x27; meetings to hear from constituents one-
     on-one about their concerns and answer their questions 
     individually. If you&#x27;re interested in scheduling a meeting 
     with me, please fill out the form on my website at 
     edwards.house.gov/chatwithchuck.
       If you want to stop by mobile office hours for assistance 
     navigating a federal agency or to just provide feedback, stay 
     updated on the office hours schedule by following the 
     Carolina Cruiser on X and Facebook, and visiting my website 
     at edwards.house.gov/carolinacruiser.
       With my warmest regards,
                                                    Chuck Edwards,
     Member of Congress.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, for over 40 years, Jerry Sanok has been 
a cornerstone of the Republican Party--a principled leader whose 
honesty, strategic mind, and dedication have earned him respect across 
Alden and beyond. It is only fitting that his hometown now honors a 
lifetime of unwavering service.
  On June 11th, Jerry will receive the Honorary Lifetime Chairman 
Award, and I&#x27;m proud to stand with the Alden Republican Committee in 
recognizing this well-earned distinction. As Chairman, Jerry has led 
winning campaigns, mentored future leaders, and built coalitions that 
have delivered victory at every level--from Town Hall to Capitol Hill. 
His political instincts are unmatched, and his advice has shaped the 
success of candidates and party leaders across New York.
  What defines Jerry most, however, is his unwavering loyalty and deep 
patriotism. For over four decades, he has worked tirelessly to make his 
community, his state, and his country stronger for the generations to 
come. In every season--in challenge and in triumph--he has stood firm 
in his convictions and committed to the conservative values that unite 
us.
  It is with great pride and deep gratitude that I join the Alden 
Republican Committee in honoring Gerald J. Sanok--for a lifetime of 
leadership, patriotism, and service to the Republican cause.

RECOGNIZING MISSION MISSISSIPPI OF LEFLORE COUNTY FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO 
               RACIAL RECONCILIATION AND COMMUNITY UNITY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and commend Mission Mississippi of Leflore County, a remarkable 
organization based in Greenwood, Mississippi, for its unwavering 
commitment to racial reconciliation, spiritual healing, and community 
building.
  Founded as part of the broader Mission Mississippi movement, which 
began in Jackson in 1992, the Leflore County chapter has become a 
beacon of hope and unity in the Mississippi Delta. At a time when 
division often dominates our national discourse, this grassroots 
organization brings people together across racial and denominational 
lines through intentional fellowship, shared meals, and mutual respect.
  Mission Mississippi of Leflore County is led by Mr. Terry Williams, a 
local painting contractor and pastor, and Mr. Luke Quinn, a minister 
and clinical therapist. Together, they facilitate regular gatherings--
often breakfasts or luncheons--that rotate between churches with 
historically Black or White congregations. These events are not mere 
meetings; they are powerful acts of reconciliation, fostering honest 
dialogue, trust, and deeper understanding among individuals of diverse 
backgrounds.
  Through these efforts, Mission Mississippi of Leflore County engages 
in what Mr. Williams aptly describes as ``heart work&#x27;&#x27;--emphasizing 
their belief that the path to racial harmony begins with the courage to 
know one another, to listen, and to love unconditionally. Their work 
underscores that true unity is not achieved solely through laws or 
policies, but through relationships and shared purpose.
  In January of this year, the chapter hosted a luncheon at St. Francis 
of Assisi Catholic Church, followed by a community meal in April that 
featured remarks from Dr. Montrell Greene, pastor of Sycamore Street 
Church of Christ. These are but a few examples of their ongoing efforts 
to bring diverse voices to the table and create a space where 
differences are acknowledged and celebrated.
  Mr. Quinn, reflecting on his journey from Texas to Georgia to 
Wisconsin before settling in the Delta, spoke candidly of Mississippi&#x27;s 
often misunderstood legacy. He rightly observed that Mississippi is too 
frequently portrayed as a scapegoat for America&#x27;s racial challenges, 
when in truth, it is home to many individuals working tirelessly to 
heal those very wounds--Mission Mississippi of Leflore County among the 
foremost.
  Grounded in faith and expansive in impact, their mission exemplifies 
what it means to live out the gospel in a divided world--breaking 
bread, building bridges, and showing that we have more in common than 
in conflict.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mission 
Mississippi of Leflore County for their vital work in uplifting their 
community, challenging stereotypes, and leading with grace and love. 
Their efforts remind us that reconciliation is possible--one 
conversation, one relationship, and one act of compassion at a time.

                     RECOGNIZING MS. JAYDEN COFFEY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN

                              of arkansas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional 
young leader from my district, Jayden Coffey, a student at Cass Job 
Corps in Franklin County, Arkansas, and the latest recipient of the 
Westerman Award--a quarterly honor given to students who demonstrate 
outstanding character, leadership, and service.
  Jayden is a shining example of what hard work, humility, and 
dedication to others can achieve. At Cass, she serves as the shop 
foreman in the paint trade department, where she leads by example and 
fosters excellence among her peers. Beyond her trade, Jayden is an 
active member of campus leadership. She serves as Secretary of the 
Student Government Association and as Vice President of her dormitory. 
roles in which she consistently promotes a culture of respect, 
accountability, and teamwork.
  What truly sets Jayden apart is her servant leadership--an approach 
rooted in humility and a deep commitment to others. Her excellent 
people-skills and ability to inspire and motivate those around her make 
her a trusted leader among students and staff alike.
  Jayden&#x27;s commitment to her community is evident both on and off 
campus. She has volunteered her time at the local food pantry and 
played a key role in a student-led campaign to collect non-perishable 
items for blessing boxes in the community of Ozark, Arkansas, ensuring 
those in need have access to essential resources.
  Jayden is also blazing trails in traditionally male-dominated fields. 
She is currently the only female member of the Fire Crew at Cass, where 
she recently passed the Pack Test and earned her Red Card for wildland 
firefighting. She participates in daily physical training to prepare 
for her upcoming Fire detail and is a dedicated member of the Camp 
Crew. Her passion for public service and emergency response will 
continue after graduation, as she plans to pursue advanced training in 
Fire and Rescue.
  Jayden Coffey represents the very best of Arkansas&#x27; youth--resilient, 
service-driven, and ready to lead. It is my honor to recognize her 
today before this body and to commend her as a model citizen and 
recipient of the Westerman Award.

       RECOGNIZING SCOTT GATTO AS JUNE 2025 VETERAN OF THE MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with profound respect and 
gratitude to recognize the extraordinary service and unwavering 
dedication of Staff Sergeant Scott Gatto, a proud veteran of the United 
States Marine Corps and our distinguished Veteran of the Month for June 
2025 from Michigan&#x27;s 9th Congressional District. His exceptional 
military career and steadfast commitment to innovation, leadership, and 
mentorship embody the very best of American service.
  Scott Gatto answered the call to serve his country after he completed 
high school when he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He 
reported to the 3rd Marine Division on September 11, 2001, just two 
hours before the tragic attack on the World Trade Center occurred. Over 
a remarkable near-decade career, Scott worked to forge strong 
relationships with foreign leaders, serving in diverse and demanding 
environments across the globe. Scott and his unit conducted hundreds of 
combat missions, demonstrating bravery and commitment.
  During the intense second Battle of Fallujah, Scott was one of only 
nine Marines from his 41-member platoon to survive. Five of these 
survivors were critically wounded. Scott and his unit demonstrated 
dedication to our country and made tremendous sacrifices.
  After his service with the United States Marine Corps, Scott played a 
vital role in working with the Department of Defense. Here, he led 
teams responsible for providing essential gear to troops on the 
battlefield. In 2013, Scott then transitioned into the pharmaceutical 
industry, applying his college education and background to become a top 
sales representative. Scott focused on advocating for patients and 
helping drive success within his teams. Scott continues to work and 
thrive in the industry by helping counteract the social stigmas 
associated with the field. He has received several honors and awards 
for his efforts.
  In 2017, Scott founded a non-profit organization called ``Reunite the 
Fight&#x27;&#x27;. The organization is dedicated to supporting veterans who 
struggle with PTSD, survivors&#x27; guilt and other mental health 
challenges. Having been diagnosed with PTSD himself, Scott felt the 
call to help other veterans access essential support such as medical 
treatments, PTSD therapy workshops, employment opportunities, and 
veterans&#x27; benefits. His non-profit has successfully helped over 1,500 
veterans and continues to make significant contributions to his 
community today.
  Above all, Scott is a devoted father to three children-Alaina, 
Scottie, and Kai. Together, they share a passion for adventure and the 
outdoors, while also valuing the importance of learning about new and 
diverse cultures.
  Mr. Speaker, let us express our sincerest appreciation to Scott Gatto 
for his outstanding military service and for his excellent acts of 
leadership that have protected our country and also helped his local 
community. His story is a testament to the American spirit of service, 
sacrifice, and leadership, and it is an honor to recognize him as our 
Veteran of the Month.

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Albert Busacca, 
a World War II combat veteran, on his 100th birthday. His bravery, 
resilience, and selflessness as a veteran helped shape a better world

  Albert served in combat during World War II in the 4th Infantry 
Division and saw action in the European Theatre of Operations. His

ethic at General Motors, where he later retired from leaving a proud

  Beyond his dedication to our country, Albert is a lifelong volunteer 
who finds joy in helping his community. He spent a lot of his time 
volunteering at soup kitchens, providing nutritious meals to families 
and individuals in need.
  Albert is also a devoted husband and loving father. He was married to 
his wife for over 60 years, and together they raised 8 children. His 
children describe him as an incredible father and one of the best 
people they have had the pleasure of knowing.
  Mr. Speaker, help me congratulate Albert Busacca, an inspiring 
example of an American, on his 100th birthday. His contributions to our 
country and community reflect his character--brave, selfless, and 
committed to serving others. His century of life continues to inspire

      SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF ORVAL MULLEN

                                 ______

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 10, 2025

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember the 
life and service of a dedicated American veteran, Mr. Orval Mullens of 
Oakwood, Ohio. Orval, who celebrated his 103rd birthday in February, 
passed away on May 15, 2025. Orval led a long, productive life, and I 
am honored to have the opportunity to recognize his many 
accomplishments in life, especially his service to our Nation.
  During World War II, Orval served as a field lineman in the Eighth 
Regiment of the Fourth Infantry of the U.S. Army from October 14, 1942, 
to September 25, 1945. Orval landed on Utah Beach on D-Day, June 6, 
1944, and he fought in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. In 
April of 1945, Orval and the soldiers of the Eighth Regiment assisted 
in the liberation of the concentration camp at Dachau. He was awarded 
two Purple Hearts for his service. He also received a Bronze Star and 
the French Legion of Honor, as well as several other medals.
  After completing his military service, he started O.H. Mullen Sales 
in the 1950s and owned and operated the business until the mid-1980s. 
His company manufactured, sold, and distributed archery equipment. He 
married Luella Conley on October 24, 1942, and they were together for 
74 years until her passing in 2016. They had three children: Dr. Orval 
Lee Mullen, James Mullen of Oakwood, and Judith Wieging of Willshire. 
The family has grown to include grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute 
to the life and service of Orval Mullen. On behalf of the Fifth 
Congressional District of Ohio, it is my honor to recognize his 
contributions to our Nation, community, and his family. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with his family as they celebrate his long life.
