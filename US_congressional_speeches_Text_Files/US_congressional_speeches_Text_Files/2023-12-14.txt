                            HON. TRENT KELLY

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life 
of The Honorable Johnny Wayne ``Judge&#x27;&#x27; McLarty who died on Monday, 
December 11, 2023, at Baptist Memorial Hospital--North Mississippi.
  Born on May 28, 1950, to the late Clara Mae and John Murry McLarty, 
Judge spent his entire life in Oxford, dedicating his heart and soul to 
his community. Serving as a judge since 1979, he was the second-
longest-elected Justice Court Judge in the State of Mississippi. 
Renowned as a devoted Ole Miss Sports enthusiast, he earned legendary 
status in Left Field and ushered in countless fans over the years. 
While he cherished his Rebels, his greatest joy came from supporting 
the Lafayette County School District and its athletic programs.
  Throughout the years, he actively participated in various roles, 
including coach, umpire, and videographer. He even drove a bus route 
for nearly two decades. As a charter member of the Splinter Valley 
Hunting Club, he enjoyed numerous days engaged in hunting and fishing. 
Judge was a dedicated member of Taylor Baptist Church and the Mason 
Lodge #33 in Oxford, fostering cherished friendships among his fellow 
masons. In addition to his judicial duties, he volunteered as a deputy 
with the sheriff&#x27;s department, served as a 911 dispatcher, and worked 
as an EMT at Oxford-Lafayette County Hospital. His ability to 
fulfillment in his career was a testament to his passion.
  Judge was not only a central figure in numerous professional and 
personal circles but, most importantly, the cornerstone of his family. 
He never missed a significant event in the lives of his children and 
grandchildren, going

so far as to livestream a graduation from his hospital bed. His 
unwavering commitment to his career, friends, and family endured until 
his final moments. Mere hours before his passing, he was sworn in for 
his 12th term as Justice Court Judge, a ceremony presided over by his 
longtime friend, Judge Howorth. Even now, his thoughts centered on his 
loved ones and the community he was honored to serve.
  In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his wife, 
Debbie Tatum McLarty, and his sister, Jeanette Wells. Judge is survived 
by his daughter, Deanna McLarty Massey and her husband, Bruce; son, 
Chad McLarty and his wife, April; brothers-in-law, Dewey Wells and 
Jimmy Tatum and his wife, Theda; seven grandchildren, Austin McLarty 
(Caitlan), Lee Murray McLarty, Alexis McLarty, Taylor Jackson, Bailey 
Jackson, Rex Massey, and Smith Massey; and two great-grandchildren, 
Myles McLarty and May Ann McLarty.

                                 ______

                           of south carolina

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the American people extend 
congratulations to the Honorable Javier Milei on being sworn in as the 
President of Argentina on Sunday, December 10, 2023. His success as a 
member of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, as well as a 
macroeconomics professor, author, and radio host, demonstrates his 
ability to be a great versatile leader.
  Best wishes to President Javier Milei for continued success to 
address Argentina&#x27;s economic crisis alleviating poverty, creating jobs, 
and promoting prosperity.
  Historically Argentina with its enterprising citizens and natural 
resources has been recognized for extraordinary capabilities. I still 
cherish, as a teenager, in Charleston, South Carolina, meeting 
Argentine President Arturo Frondizi when he arrived at the Fort Sumter 
Hotel on the historic Charleston Battery at White Point Garden.
  The inauguration of President Milei featured an overwhelming amount 
of support for him, as thousands of people from across the country and 
foreign dignitaries from around the world, including Ukrainian 
President Volodymyr Zelensky, gathered in downtown Buenos Aires on 
Sunday.
  I am grateful for the commitment of President Milei to strengthen 
relations with the United States, support Ukraine in response to war 
criminal Putin&#x27;s murderous invasion, and diversify trade away from 
China, currently their second-largest trade nation. Free nations must 
work together as our adversaries threaten national security and 
sovereignty.
  President Zelensky wrote this week that ``Freedom is what unites us, 
Ukraine and Argentina. We truly cherish it, protect it, and stand ready 
to strengthen it together.&#x27;&#x27;
  I look forward to working with President Milei on achieving Peace 
Through Strength, in the war we did not choose between Dictators with 
Rule of Gun against Democracies with Rule of Law.

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Stella Huso ahead of 
her upcoming milestone birthday. January 8 marks Stella&#x27;s 105th 
birthday, making her the oldest Gold Star Mother on record. Stella&#x27;s 
story is one of resilience, patriotism, and unwavering dedication to 
her family and country.
  Born in 1919, Stella has seen more than most of us can imagine, from 
the Great Depression and World War II to the Cuban Missile Crisis and 
Apollo 11 mission. Through it all, Stella has remained a pillar of 
strength for her family and community and channeled her energy into 
activism.
  After losing her son Wayde to an enemy artillery shell in Vietnam, 
Stella became a relentless advocate for our Nation&#x27;s veterans and their 
families. She has offered solace and support to countless military 
families in their darkest moments.
  Stella has been a dedicated community activist in her hometown of Big 
Lake. She taught Sunday School at her church, and eventually became the 
Sunday School Superintendent. Stella was also involved in local 
politics and served as caucus convener for the Big Lake area.
  Stella is a true patriot. She has written letters to the editor 
advocating for respect of our nation&#x27;s flag and the Pledge of 
Allegiance and remains one of the most active members of the Big Lake 
and Buffalo American Legion Auxiliaries.
  As she marks her 105th birthday, let us celebrate Stella and her 
incredible life. We hope that her activism and strength will inspire 
generations of Minnesotans yet to come.

outstanding contributions of Guillermo A. Ahumada, a distinguished 
journalist with a passion for giving back to his community.
  Mr. Ahumada has demonstrated exceptional professionalism in 
journalism, lending his talents to various television stations,

His work on these stations is notable, and his commitment to

department, scheduling, and supervising the selection of news--
particularly topics of interest to the Latino community.
  Outside of his role in the media, Mr. Ahumada is passionate about 
being of service to his community. He is the Executive Director of 
Chaplains Counselors, a nonprofit organization that has been 
instrumental in supporting low-income families and fostering self-
esteem and personal growth among participants. The organization 
provides educational workshops on several vital topics, including 
domestic violence, drug abuse, and family counseling.
  Mr. Ahumada also serves as the Colonel of Chaplains of the 
International Federation of Christian Chaplains. In this capacity, he 
leads and teaches individuals dedicated to helping those at risk, 
whether in prison, hospitals, or facing drug addiction.

  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Guillermo 
A. Ahumada for his tireless efforts, professional accomplishments, and

  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
the career of a devoted patriot and civil servant in Houston County, 
Georgia, Sheriff Cullen Talton.
  Mr. Talton&#x27;s dedicated career in law enforcement has spanned over 
five decades,

[[Page E1234]]

making him the longest-serving sheriff in the history of the State of 
Georgia. Born in 1932 in Bonaire, Georgia, Mr. Talton was a Houston 
County commissioner and a dairy farmer before being elected sheriff in 
1972.
  When he first took office, Mr, Talton was responsible for a 
department of just 28 employees, which has grown to over 300 today. 
Additionally, Houston County had a population of 63,000 in 1972 and now 
boasts over 170,000 residents, which Mr. Talton has selflessly 
dedicated his career to protecting and serving. He is a shining example 
for all law enforcement officers to aspire to.
  Family and friends describe Sheriff Talton as a ``role model,&#x27;&#x27; a 
``servant,&#x27;&#x27; and a ``peacekeeper.&#x27;&#x27; He has embodied the meaning of each 
of these words to their fullest during his time as Sheriff of Houston 
County. I wish Mr. Talton a long and healthy retirement, surrounded by 
the family and friends he has served tirelessly throughout his esteemed 
career.
  I would like to thank Sheriff Talton for his years of service to our 
community and our country. It is an honor to represent such outstanding 
constituents like him in the Eighth Congressional District of Georgia.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, Rhode Islanders know that small businesses are 
the backbone of every city and town in our great state. It is my 
distinct pleasure to honor Small Business Administrator District 
Director for Rhode Island Mark Hayward for his long and important 
service to our state. Mark&#x27;s service has benefited small businesses and 
the constituents of our First Congressional District in innumerable 
ways. I applaud his decades of commitment, and I express my gratitude 
on behalf of Rhode Islanders across every community for Mark&#x27;s 
dedication.
  I understand Mark&#x27;s retirement has been planned since before the 
COVID-19 pandemic. However, Mark opted to continue to serve an 
additional few long years to help ensure that the Rhode Island small 
business community saw its way through the crisis.
  Mark&#x27;s decision to help his community get to the other side of such a 
major event is the mark of a true public servant--one who is willing to 
put others first no matter the circumstances.
  The success of so many small businesses across our state is because 
of Mark&#x27;s many decades of hard work and expertise. For so many small 
business leaders, Mark&#x27;s steady leadership was a lifeline. Whether 
helping small businesses navigate the Paycheck Protection Program or 
helping new business owners access the technical resources they needed 
to be successful, Mark has been relentlessly focused on growing our 
economy through his public service during his long and effective entire 
career.
  I wish Mark some very well-deserved rest and time off with his wife 
Nancy, his children, and grandchildren. I know Mark&#x27;s commitment to our 
community is thread throughout every fiber of his being and that he 
will continue to serve his fellow Rhode Islanders for many years to 
come.
  Happy retirement to Mark, and I thank him for all he has done for 
Rhode Island.

  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of 
Lieutenant Jessica Wyman of the Nashua Fire Department, who, on 
November 28, 2023, passed away after her battle with cancer.
  Lieutenant Wyman was not only an exemplary public servant working two 
jobs as a firefighter and an ER nurse, but also a trailblazer for women 
in the fire service. She was the first female firefighter to be 
promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in Nashua Fire Department history. 
She also led week-long summer camps to help women get involved in the 
fire service.
  Lieutenant Wyman will be remembered as many things: a hero, a 
professional, a civil servant, a trailblazer, a community leader, and a 
friend. My heart is with Jessica&#x27;s husband, Chris, her family, and the 
Nashua Fire Department. May she rest in peace.

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
Phoebus High School Football Team from Hampton, Virginia on becoming 
the Virginia High School League&#x27;s Class 4 State Champions.
  On Saturday, December 9, 2023, the Phoebus Phantoms won the Class 4 
State Championship Game against the Salem High School Spartans with a 
score of 21-14. This is the third year in a row Phoebus High School has 
claimed a state championship title following two consecutive victories 
in the Class 3 division. Led by Coach Jeremy Blunt, the Phantoms won 
this title on the tail end of an equally astounding season. Phoebus 
High School closed their season undefeated, with a record of 15 wins 
and 0 losses, and maintained a 35-game winning streak going back to the 
two previous seasons.
  Throughout the game, the Phantoms and Spartans fought back and forth 
for control of the scoreboard, with the victor only being determined in 
the final moments of the game. The two teams, tied 14-14, were 
seemingly set for a showdown in overtime. But with one second remaining 
on the clock, freshman quarterback Maurikus Banks completed a pass to 
senior wide receiver Keyontae Gray, who ran the ball for an 86-yard 
touchdown to secure the championship. The determination it took for 
these young athletes to keep fighting down to the end is an example for 
all of us. Because of their hard work, they have made our community 
proud.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to again congratulate the Phoebus High School 
Football Team and thank Coach Blunt, the parents, and the entire 
Phoebus High School community for supporting these students throughout 
this remarkable season. I wish them the best in their future endeavors, 
and I wish the program continued success.

                   RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN BRIDGET GREENE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to recognize 
Captain Bridget Greene of the United States Marine Corps, for her 
service to Wisconsin&#x27;s Eighth Congressional District and my national 
security team as my 2023 Defense Fellow.
  Captain Greene started in our office as a First Lieutenant, this 
year&#x27;s youngest defense fellow in Congress. From leading her Marines as 
a logistician for Marine Aircraft Group 24 stationed at Kaneohe Bay, to 
serving as the Executive Assistant to the Chief of Staff of U.S. Indo-
Pacific Command, she has made immeasurable contributions to the Marine 
Corps and to the Joint Force prior to joining our office as a part of 
the Department of Defense Legislative Fellowship Program. She brought 
her operational experience--especially her expertise of the Indo-
Pacific area of responsibility--to our office and Armed Services 
Committee work, sharpening the tactical effectiveness of our National 
Defense Authorization Act policies focused on strengthening the 
American military&#x27;s advantage in deterring aggression vis-a-vis China.
  Like Peeps in the microwave, her influence was ever expanding. As 
duty called, Captain Greene not only crafted brilliant legislation to 
support in-theater logistics and streamline our military partnership 
with allies and partners, she also worked day-in and day-out with 
Wisconsin&#x27;s veterans, and provided unconventional and matchless counsel 
on bill designations to guarantee awareness of my policy priorities, 
notably the Deterring Attempts at Dirty Deals by Youngsters Act. While 
she is a native New Yorker, she quickly adopted the Northeast Wisconsin 
ethos by embracing a love of cheese curds, dairy animals, and Al 
Johnson&#x27;s rooftop goats.
  Through her responsibilities, she exemplified the Marine Corps motto 
``Semper Fidelis&#x27;&#x27;--Always Faithful. This eternal and collective 
commitment to the progress of our nation and steadfast loyalty to the 
Corps is evident in every moment of her service to my office. From 
recruiting future Marines in our intern cohorts simply by being an 
example of what a Marine is and could be, to being a trustworthy and 
honest adviser on the most pressing issues of national security, and 
all the while demonstrating the highest class and unwavering kindness 
to my constituents and my staff, during her time here, she is a 
truehearted patriot and I am proud to call her a fellow Marine.
  I wish Bridget the best of luck as she continues her Marine Corps 
career. She will no doubt excel and impress in her future endeavors, to 
the benefit of this country. I thank her for her service to the 
military and the people of Wisconsin, over the course of this year.

                          ____________________

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Lucetia Manwaring as she marks her retirement 
from public service after 30 years as a congressional staff member. As 
a Casework Manager in my office, Ms. Manwaring has established herself 
as a dedicated and distinguished professional with a demonstrated 
record of achievement.
  Lucetia has served our country in many ways, including in the U.S. 
Navy from 1989 to 1993. During this time, she served on the U.S. Navy 
Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Nuclear Repair Division; served 
honorably in U.S. Desert Storm campaign; and was a member of the U.S. 
Ready Reserve from 1993 to 2000. In addition, she has received several 
awards, including the Navy Wide Command Award, the National Defense 
Service Medal for Desert Storm, and a Naval Citation.
  Lucetia received her Master of Science in Human Services from Capella 
University, and her Bachelor of Business Administration from Davenport 
University. She was a member of the Dean&#x27;s List upon completing both 
degrees. Since 1994, Ms. Manwaring has helped thousands of constituents 
throughout the state of Michigan. Her tenure began as a staff member 
for my uncle, retired U.S. Congressman Dale Kildee. She met Congressman 
Dale Kildee while serving in the Navy and began her career as a staff 
member shortly thereafter. Upon his retirement, I was grateful to have 
her join my staff as well.
  Ms. Manwaring&#x27;s career is a true example of public service. 
Throughout her career she has been a tireless advocate for her 
community and her work has had a lasting impact on the lives of 
hundreds of Michiganders. I am grateful to be represented by such 
dedicated employees who work hard to make our community and Nation a 
better place.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud Ms. Lucetia Manwaring for her unwavering 
commitment to public service and extend my heartfelt gratitude for her 
years of service to our great country.

RECOGNIZING TAYLOR DOGGETT FOR HER PUBLIC SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE 39TH 
                         DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, December 14, 2023

  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Taylor Doggett and her 
tremendous work as my Communications Director. In her time in my 
office, she has been an outstanding leader, mentor, and colleague. It 
is with gratitude that I thank her for her work and her talents.
  From day one, Taylor has been dedicated to ensuring that the 
constituents of my district felt connected to my work, both at home and 
in Washington. She developed a streamlined process for expanding and 
managing contact with constituents on the issues that matter most to 
them. Under her leadership, we were able to expand our subscriber base 
significantly and provide accessible channels for the people of the 
39th District to feel connected to their Member of Congress and this 
legislative body.
  Taylor proved to be a strong advocate and valuable voice for our most 
important legislative priorities. She steered our communications team 
through some of our greatest legislative accomplishments, including the 
introduction of the Equality Act and the passage of the Korean Valor 
Act into law. Despite the challenges of being in the minority, her 
innovative vision for our social media stood out. To the members of her 
communications team, she has been a mentor and a model of running an 
effective, relationship-based comms shop.
  Above all, Taylor has been a joyful presence in my office. She is 
cheerful, sharp, and quick-witted, and her jokes often make it to my 
social media pages. She is known for always being good for a laugh or a 
heart-to-heart chat among my staff. Wherever she may go down the road, 
she will always be a member of Team Takano.
  I am enormously grateful to Taylor for her contributions. She will be 
dearly missed, and I wish her luck in her next adventure.
