               HONORING BATTALION CHIEF TONY R. GARRISON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 20, 2024

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor 
Battalion Chief Tony R. Garrison who was killed in the line of duty on 
September 27 when Tropical Storm Helene hit Western North Carolina. 
Tony was a native of Western North Carolina and by every account, Tony 
was a great man.
  Known for his outgoing personality and compassionate nature, Tony 
enjoyed woodworking, fishing, and most of all, spending time with his 
family. Tony leaves behind the love of his life and wife of 28 years, 
Mary Chantelle Garrison, his daughter Hannah, and his son Dylan.
  I would like to extend my appreciation for the work he accomplished 
during his time with the U.S. Forest Service, as a volunteer with the 
Garren Creek Fire Department, member of the Buncombe County Task Force, 
and as an instructor at A-B Tech in Asheville. Tony dedicated his life 
to serving others and protecting his neighbors.
  As a Battalion Chief with the Fairview Volunteer Fire Department, 
Tony was used to running towards danger when others would run away. 
Friday, September 27 was a day of confusion and destruction in Western 
North Carolina.
  Helene made landfall Thursday night and by Friday morning millions of 
people were left

[[Page E1328]]

without cell service, power, or any way to contact the outside world as 
trees fell and landslides washed away their houses, neighbors, and 
family members.
  Tony&#x27;s community of Fairview saw historic levels of flooding and 
suffered from catastrophic damage. During the confusion, Tony did what 
he was trained to do and what he spent his life doing--helping save 
others. While Tony worked with his nephew Brandon Ruppe to rescue 
neighbors during a landslide, a second landslide occurred and both Tony 
and Brandon tragically passed away from their injuries.
  I offer my deepest condolences to the Garrison family. I will 
continue to keep them and their loved ones in my thoughts and prayers. 
Tony is a hero and will be remembered for his lifetime of service.

                          ____________________

  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the outstanding

to my office during her time as a Congressional Hispanic Caucus 
Institute Fellow. Genesis has served with distinction in my office and 
dedicated her time to serving the people of Florida&#x27;s 24th

  Genesis holds an impressive academic background, earning three 
undergraduate degrees from the University of South Florida in History, 
Secondary Social Studies Education, and Classics and a master&#x27;s degree 
in public policy from Georgetown University. Genesis demonstrated 
exceptional leadership and a deep commitment to advancing education 
equity during her fellowship. Her extensive experience as a teacher 
brought a wealth of knowledge that greatly enhanced our education 
policy efforts. Genesis immersed herself in the legislative process, 
consistently delivering high-quality briefing memos and policy 
recommendations.
  In addition to her policy work in higher education, Genesis played a 
key role in drafting bills and collaborating with several organizations 
to move our legislative priorities forward. Her ability to articulate 
complex ideas through Op-eds and legislative writing further 
underscored her dedication to the issues we care deeply about. She also

meaningful projects and ensuring each team

continued success in all her future endeavors.

colleagues to join me in honoring Genesis for her commitment and

  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small business 
in my district that is an important part of the Sugar Hill community: 
Polly&#x27;s Pancake Parlor.
  Since it was opened in 1938 by Willfred and Pauline ``Polly&#x27;&#x27; Taylor, 
Polly&#x27;s pancakes has served up some of the lightest, fluffiest pancakes 
in New England, attracting visitors from across the Nation. Beyond 
serving excellent food, Polly&#x27;s helped popularize maple syrup as a 
sweetener, contributing to the success of New Hampshire&#x27;s world-
renowned maple syrup industry.
  What truly makes Polly&#x27;s standout is the generous hospitality. When 
you visit Polly&#x27;s, you&#x27;re treated like a member of the family. That is 
why I have relished the opportunity to bring my family and friends to 
Polly&#x27;s both before and during my time in Congress. Polly&#x27;s is an

                 RECOGNIZING THE 2024 AAA STARS OF LIFE

                                 ______

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 20, 2024

  Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the members of the 
emergency medical services (EMS) profession who dedicate their lives to 
providing often lifesaving medical care and transport services to 
patients as well as entire communities. These health care professionals 
are on the frontlines of providing vital emergency 9-1-1 and 
interfacility ambulance services.
  Every year, the dispatch of an ambulance is the first response to 
millions of medical emergencies. Often, the survival of a patient is 
enhanced by the prompt medical attention provided by paramedics and 
emergency medical technicians (EMTs) prior to the arrival at an 
emergency department. As a result of the selfless acts of these 
courageous and devoted professions, the lives of thousands of Americans 
are saved each year. While these professionals do not expect to receive 
recognition for their work, they deserve our outmost gratitude.
  I would like to highlight a very special group of EMS professionals 
or ``Stars of Life&#x27;&#x27; who were honored this by the American Ambulance 
Association. These Stars of Life are meeting with their members of 
Congress this week and I strongly encourage my colleagues to take the 
time to chat with these exceptional individuals.
  The American Ambulance Association honors each year those paramedics, 
emergency medical technicians, dispatchers and other ambulance service 
personnel who exemplify what is best about the EMS field. The American 
Ambulance Association has appropriately designated these individuals as 
``Stars of Life&#x27;&#x27;. Past Stars of Life have included paramedics and EMTs 
who were part of evacuation and response efforts to natural disasters, 
acts of terrorism and public health emergencies. Members of this year&#x27;s 
Stars of Life program are no different and were involved with 
exceptional acts such as delivering and saving a baby born pulseless 
during transport to a hospital and extracting a patient involved in a 
fiery

[[Page E1325]]

car crash and then providing critical medical care.
  Of equal importance, this program also pays tribute to those 
ambulance service personnel whose heroic acts or community service 
activities may not have made the news, but were just as meaningful to 
the people they aided. They are truly America&#x27;s health care safety net.
  I am especially proud of the five Stars of Life from Oregon being 
recognized this year who serve Oregonians with pride. They are Aubree 
Arneson, Jorge Garcia, Jason Hodges, Don Marr and Joe Scott. I had the 
opportunity to meet with Jorge Garcia with Umpqua Valley Ambulance from 
Roseburg, Oregon today and can tell you he is a fIrst-class EMS 
professional who deeply cares about his community and his patients.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the names, organizations and 
hometowns of the 2024 American Ambulance Association Stars of Life 
honorees.

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 20, 2024

  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize 
the Mo Better Jaguars of Brownsville, Brooklyn, who capped off an 
undefeated season by overcoming their opponent 13-7 in the national Pop 
Warner Super Bowl in Orlando. Truly, these exceptional young men have 
defied all the odds and proven precisely what Brooklyn is capable of.
  While the team&#x27;s skill, cohesion, and passion were never in question 
throughout their sensational season, when challenges brought upon by 
high travel costs arose that would have prevented the Jaguars from 
competing for the D2 Title, their community stepped in. Through their 
support, the team succeeded in raising the funds they needed to reach 
the championship game, where they ultimately prevailed.
  I extend my sincerest congratulations to every player, coach, family, 
and fan whose collective efforts led the Mo Better Jaguars to their 
well-deserved victory. Our community is incredibly proud of their 
achievements and their dedication, and we look forward to watching 
their athletic careers continue as they reach new and exciting 
triumphs.

                          ____________________

  Councilman Smith&#x27;s lifelong dedication to service and leadership has

  Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Council 
President Jay Dunham, who will retire at the end of this month after an 
extraordinary 14 years of faithful and dedicated service as a 
councilman in Jefferson Township.
  Council President Dunham&#x27;s commitment to public service is rooted in 
a distinguished career that spans multiple industries and an unwavering

commander and current quartermaster for VFW Post 564, as well as a past 
commander and current chaplain of American Legion Post 423. His 
leadership in these roles reflects his enduring dedication to his 
fellow servicemembers who answered our Nation&#x27;s call to service.
  He has been an active member of the Milton First Aid Squad, the 
Jefferson Township Historical Society, and the St. Thomas Church 
finance committee. Additionally, he is a founding member of the

community has left an indelible mark on Jefferson Township.
  I want to express my gratitude to Council President Dunham for his 
decades of service and for the countless ways he has enriched the lives 
of others, and I wish him the best for a well-earned and restful 
retirement.

   RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF COMMISSIONER ANTONIO WILLIAMS OF WAYNE 
                         COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. WILEY NICKEL

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 20, 2024

  Mr. NICKEL. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
proclamation honoring the service of Commissioner Antonio Williams.
  Whereas Commissioner Antonio Williams continues to advocate for the 
creation of the Wayne County Homeless Committee to combat homelessness 
in Wayne County.
  Whereas Commissioner Williams accomplished the approval of digital 
libraries in District 2, which in turn brought more support to the 
Summer Youth Employment Program that he started.
  Whereas the commissioners approved resolutions authorizing the 
spending of national opioid settlement funds, which will bring needed 
relief to communities impacted by the opioid epidemic in Wayne County. 
These funds support every aspect of the effort to combat addiction, 
from early intervention to recovery support services and the treatment 
of incarcerated people.
  Whereas the commissioners&#x27; progress on public service infrastructure, 
from the Northern Wayne County Library, to Fremont Elementary school, 
adds to the quality of life in Wayne County and contributes to the 
delivery of essential support for all constituents.
  Whereas the increased allocation for public schools in this year&#x27;s 
budget, including expansion of the School Resource Officer program is 
critical to ensuring safe and accessible public education.
  I, Wiley Nickel, Congressman of the 13th District of North Carolina, 
am honored to recognize the incredible service of Commissioner Antonio 
Williams of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners. Commissioner 
Williams&#x27; efforts to improve citizens&#x27; lives through public service is 
laudable, and his impact on community is immeasurable. I Thank 
Commissioner Williams for his devoted attention to Wayne County and 
contributions to the strength of our state.
