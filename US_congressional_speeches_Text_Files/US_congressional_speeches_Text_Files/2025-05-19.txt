            CELEBRATING THE ASIAN AMERICAN HERITAGE FESTIVAL

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 19, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
Asian American Heritage Festival. A cultural event that is dedicated 
and celebrated for the cultural traditions and contributions of Asian 
Americans throughout the United States.
  The Asian American Heritage Festival is committed to enriching the 
cultural fabric of our community, fostering understanding, 
appreciation, and shared experiences among people of all backgrounds. 
It stands as a vital bridge to connect culture, diversity and unity 
through storytelling, exciting performances, and delicious food.
  Beyond all of the exciting attractions that the Asian American 
Heritage Festival offers, there is a strong focus on community and 
education. Generations-long recounting of resilience, and

[[Page E448]]

cultural history are provided for those who listen.
  The Asian American Heritage Festival is a dynamic hub for community 
engagement and cross-cultural connection. It represents a bold vision: 
one where multiculturalism is not only celebrated but woven into the 
daily life and economic vitality of our region.
  Mr. Speaker, as we acknowledge this celebration, let us recognize the 
essential role that the Asian American Heritage Festival plays--not 
just as an event, but as a beacon of cultural exchange, generational 
growth, and community spirit. Please join me in ceIebrating and 
honoring the achievements of the Asian American Heritage Festival, as 
they remain an enduring source of pride and connection for generations 
to come.

              COMMEMORATING THE 1842 BUFFALO CREEK TREATY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 19, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and 
recognize the 1842 Buffalo Creek Treaty, a Landmark agreement that 
contributed to the history of Native Americans and the United States. 
Signed in a partnership agreement between the United States and the 
Seneca Nation of Indians, the Buffalo Creek Treaty ensured that the 
culture and heritage of the Seneca Nation remains on their rightful 
land in the Allegany and Cattaraugus Reservations.
  Signed nearly two centuries ago in Western New York, the Buffalo 
Creek Treaty reaffirmed the Seneca Nation&#x27;s right to self-govern and 
protect their remaining land. Seneca Nation leaders banded together, 
ensuring that the various nations of Western New York were not 
displaced and their culture allowed to survive--a significant victory 
for the Seneca people. The unwavering dedication to their heritage and 
people ensures the well-being, sovereignty, and prosperity of future 
generations.
  To this day, the Seneca Nation territory in Allegany and Cattaraugus 
counties are sovereign territories. It is immensely important that the 
provisions of the Buffalo Creek Treaty continue to be recognized and 
followed, as it is a symbol of self determination and coexistence. As 
we uphold the Buffalo Creek Treaty, we are continuously working toward 
mending and strengthening the ties between New York State and the 
Seneca Nation of Indians.
  Today, as we celebrate 183 years of the 1842 Buffalo Creek Treaty, we 
look forward with hope for the future, but also acknowledgment of the 
past. The Buffalo Creek Treaty is a promise of sovereignty and respect. 
Please join me in recognizing and celebrating the Seneca Nation of 
Indians for their many contributions to Western New York and the United 
States of America.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 19, 2025

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Mary 
Vollink, an exceptional resident of Traverse City, Michigan, for 
receiving the Distinguished Service Award from the Traverse Connect 
Board of Directors. Since 1929, this prestigious honor has been awarded 
to outstanding individuals for their significant contributions to 
social, economic, and

[[Page E449]]

cultural improvements within the Traverse City area.
  Currently, Ms. Vollink serves as the Office Manager and Volunteer 
Coordinator for the Salvation Army in Traverse City, where her 
dedication to public service has made an immeasurable impact on 
Northern Michigan. Her tireless efforts have both helped countless 
individuals in times of need and undoubtedly strengthened the community 
across Grand Traverse County. Ms. Vollink&#x27;s selection for this award 
speaks volumes about her character and her commitment to improving the 
lives of others.
  Mary&#x27;s work with the Salvation Army began nearly 40 years ago in 
Holland, Michigan. After relocating to Traverse City in 1988, Ms. 
Vollink joined the Traverse City Salvation Army while simultaneously 
working for the TCAPS Transportation Department as a school bus driver 
for elementary students and students with special needs--a role she 
held until 2010. In addition to serving as the Office Manager and 
Volunteer Coordinator for the Salvation Army, Ms. Vollink works as an 
Emergency Disaster Services Coordinator for the region. Throughout her 
continued commitment to public service, she has formed lasting bonds 
with countless Northern Michigan families.
  Mr. Speaker, Mary Vollink exemplifies the spirit of selfless service 
that strengthens communities across Michigan&#x27;s First District. Her 
selection for the Distinguished Service Award is well deserved, and I 
ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mary Vollink on this 
outstanding achievement and thanking her for her decades of exemplary 
service to the people of Traverse City and Northern Michigan.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
celebrate the remarkable 75-year legacy of Mississippi Valley State 
University (MVSU), an institution that has profoundly impacted the 
Mississippi Delta and the state of Mississippi as a whole.
  Founded in 1950 as Mississippi Vocational College, MVSU began with a 
mission to train teachers for rural and elementary schools and to 
provide vocational training. Over the decades, it has evolved into a 
comprehensive university offering a diverse range of undergraduate and 
graduate programs, including degrees in environmental health, criminal 
justice, business administration, and education. MVSU&#x27;s commitment to 
academic excellence and community service has remained steadfast 
throughout its history.
  Under the leadership of its eighth and current president, Dr. Jerryl 
Briggs, Sr., MVSU continues to advance its mission with the mantra: 
``ONE GOAL. ONE TEAM. ONE VALLEY . . . IN MOTION.&#x27;&#x27; The university has 
expanded its reach through off-campus centers such as the Greenwood 
Center and the Greenville Higher Learning Center, enhancing access to 
education in the Mississippi Delta.
  As we commemorate this significant milestone, let us recognize the 
contributions of MVSU&#x27;s students, faculty, alumni, and administration. 
Their dedication and hard work have ensured that Mississippi Valley of 
State University remains a beacon of opportunity and a catalyst for 
positive change in our community.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mississippi 
Valley State University on its 75th anniversary and look forward to the 
continued success and impact of this esteemed institution.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MARK E. AMODEI

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 19, 2025

  Mr. AMODEI of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues 
to join me in congratulating Delaynie Bowley. Delaynie is a member of 
Girl Scouts of the Sierra Nevada, Troop 188, and has exemplified 
extraordinary leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a 
demonstrated commitment to making a lasting, positive impact, by 
earning the most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.
  Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing 
to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the 
world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results. To earn 
the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify 
and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead 
a team of experts and community members to implement a project that 
produces lasting change. Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award 
Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and 
leadership, distinguishing them from their peers. Through their 
resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to 
truly make the world a better place.
  For her Gold Award project, Delaynie Bowley created ``Pet Safety 
Patrol&#x27;&#x27; to tackle the widespread issue of pet poisoning, which affects 
more than 401,500 animals annually in the U.S. Recognizing a gap in pet 
owners&#x27; knowledge about household hazards and essential pet first aid, 
Delaynie assembled and distributed pet first aid kits at Desert Hills 
Animal Hospital. She educated more than 50 people in one-on-one 
meetings about common dangers in their own homes. She provided each 
participant with a pet first aid kit, which included a pamphlet with a 
link to her website, which offers additional resources and a 
customizable pamphlet for animal hospitals and veterinarians to use 
nationwide.
  On behalf of the 2nd Congressional District of Nevada, I congratulate 
Delaynie Bowley for achieving the highest distinction in Girl Scouts, 
the Gold Award. We thank Delaynie for her leadership and for making 
such a positive, lasting change in our community.

  Kristianna Meister designed ``Dancing Through The Decades&#x27;&#x27; to 
enhance the lives of senior citizens and those who may need extra 
assistance going through life. Through dance, Kristianna created a 
program that engaged participants both mentally and physically, with 
the goal of getting people up and moving. She led participants in 
guided stretches to help them feel good in their bodies. She taught 
them about the history of different styles of dance and basic steps 
from each style of dance to get the participants engaged and moving. 
She created instructional videos for the dances, which were posted on 
YouTube and distributed to Senior Centers around the country.
  On behalf of the 2nd Congressional District of Nevada, I congratulate 
Kristianna Meister for achieving the highest distinction in Girl 
Scouts, the Gold Award. We thank Kristianna for her leadership and for 
making such a positive, lasting change in our community.

  Mr. EVANS of Colorado. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
congratulate the winners and honorable mentions of Northglenn High 
School&#x27;s annual Congressional App Challenge. This competition has 
allowed high school students to recognize and encourage STEM talent 
across the Nation, as well as in my Congressional District. This year, 
I&#x27;m proud to recognize the following individuals for their talent and 
ingenuity in this year&#x27;s Congressional App Challenge.
  Payton Dollens developed an app to help high school students get 
involved in school activities by creating incentives through prizes and 
competitions. Her app addresses the importance of school involvement 
and giving students an opportunity to participate in our community. As 
a result of her ingenuity and creativity, her app won Best in Show in 
the Open Division.
  Honorable mentions to highlight are Brayden Green, Bryan Korsen, and 
Desmond Reynolds. This group created an app that shares the negative 
effects of pollution on our oceans. The app both educates users about 
what needs to be cleaned out and shares how that can be done. With the 
combination of education and animations, this group earned an Honorable 
Mention in the Open Division.
  Alongside those from our Open Division are winners from this year&#x27;s 
Rookie Division. The four students I would like to recognize for 
winning Best in Show are Lena McLaughlin, Hailey Fredrickson, Magdalena 
Herron-Skretta, and Kaylee Reinhardt. They developed an app that helps 
others learn how to cope with different emotions. By utilizing games, 
educational material, and informative tips, their app provides helpful 
insight on how to better handle emotions.
  Finally, I would like to recognize Gus Blackham and Ila Locke for 
earning an Honorable Mention in the Rookie Division. Their app teaches 
about the negative effects of plastic on our oceans. The duo did this 
by developing a game to educate users about the consequences of plastic 
on ocean wildlife and help spread awareness about keeping our oceans 
clean.
  Once again, I want to extend my sincerest congratulations to the 
winners and honorable mentions in this year&#x27;s Congressional App 
Challenge at Northglenn High School. I am proud of the hard work and 
dedication they have put into their projects and am excited to see what 
they will achieve in the future.

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 19, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding constituent from

[[Page E450]]

my district, U.S. Army Chaplain (Lieutenant Colonel) John M. Diller who 
is retiring from Chaplain service to the Pennsylvania Army National 
Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve after over 21 years.
  Chaplain Diller was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania to a family with 
a rich history of ecclesiastical and military service. Chaplain 
Diller&#x27;s lineage includes servicemembers involved in every major United 
States military campaign since his ancestors immigrated to America in 
the early 1900&#x27;s.
  After earning his Bachelor of Science in Music Education from Lebanon 
Valley College, Annville, Pennsylvania in 1991, John taught music in 
elementary and middle schools and directed several choirs. After 
several career changes, John felt his calling to enter seminary and to 
join the Pennsylvania Army National Guard as a Chaplain following the 
September 11, 2001 attacks. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, 
Chaplain Candidate on February 26, 2004, and began drilling with the 
108th Field Artillery, 56th Brigade, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. 
Chaplain Diller served with the 2nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion 
before being called back to the 56th Stryker Brigade for mobilization 
to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2008 to 2009.
  Chaplain Diller transferred to the Army Reserves in 2015, upon a 
family move to Orange Park, Florida. His first assignment was as a 
Brigade Chaplain with the 207th Regional Support Group out of Fort 
Jackson, South Carolina. Though he left the 207th because he was 
selected to serve as the Mission Support Element Chaplain for the 143rd 
Mission Support Element in Orlando, the 207th requested his return when 
the unit was marked for their first deployment since the start of the 
Global War of Terror. The 207th was the Base Operations Support element 
on Al Asad Air Base when it was attacked on January 8, 2020, by Iranian 
ballistic missiles. Chaplain Diller was the only Chaplain on the base, 
and the only Soldier Support element. For 5 days, Chaplain Diller drew 
upon his training in Traumatic Event Management and Critical Incident 
Stress Management to perform at least seven group debriefings/de-
escalations following the attack. On the 5th, when multiple Behavioral 
Health and Chaplain teams finally arrived, the Behavioral Health lead 
Officer observed Chaplain Diller&#x27;s program and instructed his teams to 
``learn and perform that program.&#x27;&#x27;
  After, Chaplain Diller was selected as the Command Chaplain for the 
Deployment Support Command (DSC), in Birmingham, Alabama. He oversaw 56 
Chaplains, Chaplain Candidates, and Religious Affairs Specialists in 16 
states and 4 time zones.
  Chaplain Diller has consistently received the highest praise and 
commendation from both his Branch Supervisors and his Unit Commanders. 
His dedication to the highest standards of the Army Values, and the 
principles of duty, honor, respect reflect well upon himself, the Army, 
and the Chaplain Corps. The residents in my district are blessed to 
have this Pennsylvanian grown citizen back home, and I congratulate him 
on his Army retirement and wish him, his family, and his congregation 
God-speed.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                          Monday, May 19, 2025

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, South Carolinians are 
grateful that the Kimberly-Clark Corporation is expanding within the 
Second District of South Carolina. As a producer of personal care 
products, Kimberly-Clark produces well-known brands such as Cottonelle, 
Huggies, Kleenex, Scott, and more.
  Since its establishment in 1968, the Beech Island facility, with the 
leadership of plant manager, Jeff Hutter, has grown to become the 
company&#x27;s largest manufacturing site globally. The planned addition of 
1.1 million square feet in 2027 will further expand its capabilities 
and impact.
  The $200 million investment will create more than 150 new jobs, 
strengthen the local economy, and enhance career opportunities across 
the state. The expansion will also incorporate advanced robotics, 
artificial intelligence powered logistics systems, and high-density 
automated storage to improve operation efficiencies.
  With a workforce of over 40,000 and a presence in more than 175 
countries, Kimberly-Clark continues to demonstrate a commitment to 
innovation and growth. I appreciate the dedication and leadership of 
President Russ Torres.
  Best wishes to Kimberly-Clark for success in their future endeavors.
