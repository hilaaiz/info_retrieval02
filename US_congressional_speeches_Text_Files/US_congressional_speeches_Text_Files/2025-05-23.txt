  Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida&#x27;s Third Congressional 
District, we wish Ms. Elsa Lewis a very happy 100th birthday.
  Elizabeth Marie Kretzschmar better known as ``Elsa,&#x27;&#x27; is the youngest 
of three children born to German immigrant, Fritz Kretzschmar and 
Austrian immigrant, Josie Wittescheck Kretzschmar on June 6, 1925 in 
San Gabriel, California.
  During World War II, she met and married a Navy sailor by the name of 
Wesley Inman Lewis and moved to Gainesville, Florida while he attended 
the University of Florida. Upon graduation, they moved to Thomasville, 
GA and resided on Miilpond Plantation where Inman was the forestry 
supervisor for the many acres of the plantation. During their residency 
in Thomasville, Elsa was a homemaker and gave birth to three children, 
a girl and two boys. In the 1960s the family moved back to Inman&#x27;s 
hometown, Alachua, Florida, to open a fertilizer plant and farm one of 
the largest tobacco farms in the area. Elsa had been a bookkeeper 
before her children arrived and became the bookkeeper for the 
fertilizer plant they owned and operated in Alachua.
  She has spent her remaining years here in Alachua after retiring from 
bookkeeping when the fertilizer plant was sold. All three of her 
children and their families live close by as well as seven 
grandchildren and great grandchildren. She is fondly known to her great 
grandchildren and great, great grandchildren as ``GiGi.&#x27;&#x27;
  Even though she is approaching 100 years loved, she is still 
dependent and lives on her own with children and grandchildren keeping 
her busy.
  Congratulations to Ms. Elsa on 100 amazing years.

 COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR AND 
        THE RESETTLEMENT OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES TO AMERICA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 23, 2025

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join thousands of my 
constituents from the Cambodian, Hmong, Lao and Vietnamese Diaspora 
communities in Minnesota and across the country to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. As we commemorate this 
painful legacy, we also mark the 50th anniversary of the resettlement 
of more than 1 million Southeast Asian refugees to the United States of 
America after the war. Minnesota is home to 95,000 Hmong, 33,000 
Vietnamese, 16,000 Cambodians and 12,000 Lao Americans. These vibrant 
communities are flourishing and making tremendous contributions to our 
social, economic, political, and cultural lives.
  Southeast Asian Minnesotans are thriving throughout our state as 
entrepreneurs, professionals, engineers, and in the skilled tradesmen 
and women; serving our community as teachers, law enforcement officers, 
nurses, and medical doctors; and serving our nation and state in the 
Armed Forces and the Minnesota National Guard. These new Americans&#x27; 
success stories exemplify the spirit of resilience. Many have overcome 
tremendous difficulties and challenges in pursuing the American dream, 
especially Hmong and Laotian war veterans who fought alongside American 
forces during the secret war in Laos, and who continue to cope with the 
trauma of war, mental health challenges and other legacies of war.
  Recently, it was an honor to address the Hmong National Development 
(HND) Conference in Minnesota and commemorate the historic 50th 
anniversary celebration of Hmong refugees&#x27; resettlement to America. As 
home of one of the largest Hmong American populations outside of 
Southeast Asia, I am very proud to have six Hmong American state 
legislators representing constituents in my district! In total, 9 
lawmakers of Hmong descent represent legislative districts at the 
Minnesota State Capitol.
  As we celebrate Asian Pacific Heritage Month this year, it is a time 
to pause and reflect on these significant and historic milestones. It 
is also a time to look to the future. I am grateful for the rich 
cultural diversity our Southeast Asian Diaspora communities have 
brought to our nation and to Minnesota&#x27;s Fourth Congressional District 
over the last fifty years. I look forward to the continued growth, 
success, partnership and collaboration with our Southeast Asian 
neighbors.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in commemorating the 50th Anniversary of 
the Vietnam War and the resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees to 
America.

                          ____________________

                   HONORING DEPUTY CHRISTOPHER PARISH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RUDY YAKYM III

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 23, 2025

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the extraordinary 
bravery and selfless service demonstrated by Deputy Christopher Parish 
of the Pulaski County Sheriffs Office.
  This past April, Deputy Parish responded to a vehicle fire near a 
residence in Winamac, Indiana. Upon arrival, he discovered that the 
fire had spread to the house, which was rapidly becoming engulfed in 
flames. Although initial reports indicated that all occupants had 
evacuated. Deputy Parish heard a voice from inside the burning home. 
Without hesitation, he broke a window using his flashlight, but dense 
smoke prevented the trapped individual from escaping. At this critical 
moment, volunteer firefighter Mike Anderson arrived on the scene. 
Together, Deputy Parish and Firefighter Anderson entered the smoke-
filled room through the broken window and successfully rescued the 
individual, pulling him to safety just before the fire overtook the 
room.
  The rescued individual received immediate medical attention and is 
currently in stable condition. Deputy Parish was treated for smoke 
inhalation and sustained minor cuts during the rescue.
  Deputy Parish&#x27;s actions exemplify the highest standards of public 
service and courage. His quick thinking and fearless response 
undoubtedly saved a life that day. His heroism serves as an inspiration 
to us all and underscores the vital role of first responders in our 
committees.
  I thank Deputy Christopher Parish for his valor and dedication to 
public safety.

                          ____________________

  Joshua&#x27;s vision has always been to build bridges between cultures, 
fostering greater understanding and appreciation among the diverse 
communities of Central Florida. His leadership, both in ministry and in 
cultural outreach, continues to make a significant impact on the 
region, empowering the next generation and bringing communities

  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Mr. 
Louis DeJoy, for his dedicated service as the 75th Postmaster General 
of the United States.
  Appointed in June 2020, Mr. DeJoy helped navigate the United States 
Postal Service through the uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 
pandemic. Under his direction, the U.S. Postal Service maintained its 
essential mission of delivering mail and packages to the American 
people, keeping family and friends connected in this challenging time.
  In addition to navigating the pandemic, Mr. DeJoy was responsible for 
implementing important reforms and cost-saving measures with the goal 
of making the U.S. Postal Service more efficient. In pursuit of these 
goals, Mr. DeJoy secured $50 billion dollars from Congress for USPS 
restructuring, as well as sought assistance from the Department of 
Government Efficiency to streamline the USPS and successfully improve 
the inner workings of the agency.
  A very successful businessman and expert in logistics, Mr. DeJoy was 
able to bring all stakeholders to the table. His honest, 
straightforward approach gained the trust of postal employees, union 
representatives and lawmakers.
  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Mr. DeJoy for his 
service to the American people, and his steadfast leadership of the 
U.S. Postal Service marked by a return to common sense and increased 
productivity, and success navigating a global pandemic.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Mr. Louis DeJoy for his

We wish him, his wife Aldona, and the family all the best in the 
future.

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, Takemasa lshikura is the president of the 
Japan Association of Orlando (JAO) and has played a vital role in 
preserving and promoting Japanese heritage in Central Florida for over 
two decades. He first came to the United States in 1983 as a performer

engagement led to the founding of Matsuriza, a professional taiko group 
that continues to perform weekly at the Japan Pavilion in Epcot, 
delighting millions of guests from around the world. Matsuriza has also 
traveled extensively across the United States to entertain audiences at 
cultural events and festivals.

Festival from a small gathering at a restaurant into a major annual 
celebration in Kissimmee, now drawing over 10,000 attendees. Festival 
proceeds support Japanese language education and have contributed over 
$20,000 to disaster relief efforts nationwide, including California and 
Hawaii, as well as in Asian countries, including Japan and the 
Philippines.

Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one of only 94 overseas recipients 
that year. Additional honors include the Commendation Award of the 
Consul General, recognition by the Orange County Asian Committee, and

clinics, and preventive services. He also held leadership roles at 
multiple hospitals, nursing facilities, and continues to serve as a 
trusted physician in the community.
  His leadership during the COVID-l9 pandemic was especially critical. 
As Health Authority, Dr. Trevino launched a binational vaccination 
program with Nuevo Laredo and Colombia, Nuevo Leon--administering 
nearly 300,000 vaccines and significantly reducing hospitalizations and 
deaths on both sides of the border.
  Elected Mayor in 2022, Dr. Trevino continues to serve with compassion 
and a deep belief in the betterment of our city.
  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Trevino&#x27;s life is a testament to service rooted in 
heritage and guided by purpose. On behalf of the 28th District of 
Texas, I thank him for his enduring commitment to Laredo.

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 23, 2025

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, standing at Arlington National 
Cemetery, the weight of history surrounds you--rows of white headstones 
stretching endlessly, each marking a life dedicated to service. But 
among them, one site stands apart: the eternal flame at President John 
F. Kennedy&#x27;s final resting place. As the flame flickers, unwavering, 
the words from his inaugural address echo in your mind.
  ``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we 
shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any 
friend, oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of 
liberty.&#x27;&#x27;
  President Kennedy spoke those words in 1961, but he could have said 
them today, or yesterday. More than a declaration, those words are a 
promise woven into the fabric of American history, upheld by the 
generations of men and women laid to rest around him. To put it simply, 
President Kennedy&#x27;s immortal words encapsulate Memorial Day perfectly.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Memorial Day, a time to 
commemorate the valor and sacrifices of the brave men and women who 
laid down their lives in service to our nation. To recall those who 
enlisted in our armed forces and fought to preserve our American 
liberties, values, and way of life.
  We remember the men who ran ashore the beaches of Normandy to end 
WWII; those who fought in the snows of Korea; the bravery of those who 
fought in the impenetrable jungles and unbearable heat of Vietnam; as 
well as the men and women who were called to serve in the aftermath of 
9/11. America is the world&#x27;s superpower, but our freedom comes at a 
cost that has included the lives of the brightest and boldest of our 
Nation.
  It is only fitting that on Memorial Day, we find ourselves reflecting 
on those individuals who so bravely and instinctively risked their all 
in the face of severe danger. I am reminded of the poignant words of 
Navy veteran Jack Crawford, who, while serving aboard the USS Yorktown 
when it was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942, once stated:
  ``There aren&#x27;t many things you can take out of this planet . . . but 
you can take with you, wherever you go, consciousness of duty 
faithfully performed.&#x27;&#x27;
  That which we simply call `duty,&#x27; a word we use freely and do not 
give the reverence it deserves--is the motto, way of life and heartfelt 
song of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard members, who 
constantly and without hesitation put their lives on the line for our 
freedoms.
  Mr. Speaker, the men and women who have given their lives in service 
to this nation are--irrevocably--heroes. When their country called, 
they answered. No matter how they found their way to service, each took 
it upon him or herself to serve faithfully and to their fullest, while 
giving their last measure of devotion to our country.
  We owe them more than just remembrance; we owe them gratitude, 
respect, and a promise to forever uphold the values for which they 
fought and died.

              HONORING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER MIKE ANDERSON

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RUDY YAKYM III

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 23, 2025

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the courageous actions 
of volunteer firefighter Mike Anderson of Buffalo, Indiana, whose 
selfless service exemplifies the highest ideals of public safety and 
community commitment.
  On April 11, 2025, a vehicle fire near a residence in Winamac, 
Indiana, escalated into a house fire. Deputy Christopher Parish of the 
Pulaski County Sheriff&#x27;s Office arrived on the scene and discovered 
that the fire had spread to the house, which was rapidly becoming 
engulfed in flames. Although initial reports indicated that all 
occupants had evacuated, Deputy Parish heard a voice from inside the 
burning home. Without hesitation, he broke a window using his 
flashlight, but dense smoke prevented the trapped individual from 
escaping. At this critical moment, volunteer firefighter Mike Anderson 
arrived on the scene.
  Together, Deputy Parish and Firefighter Anderson entered the smoke-
filled room through the broken window and successfully rescued the 
individual, pulling him to safety just before the fire overtook the 
room.
  Firefighter Anderson&#x27;s actions exemplify the highest standards of 
public service and courage. His quick thinking and fearless response 
undoubtedly saved a life that day. His heroism serves as an inspiration 
to us all and underscores the vital role of first responders in our 
communities.
  I thank Mike for his valor and dedication to public safety.

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I was participating in a Congressional 
Delegation to the Holy See to attend the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV 
and our military plane experienced mechanical problems. I was delayed 
in returning to the District of Columbia. Had I been present, I would 
have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 132, and YEA on Roll Call No. 133.

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
National Public Works Week, which takes place from May 18-24, 2025, and 
to offer a special greeting to the City of Anniston Public Works 
Department.
  Our public works professionals dedicate their time and talent to 
maintaining the infrastructure and facilities essential to public 
health and our quality of life. In Anniston, that work is carried out 
under the capable leadership of David Arnett and Supervisory staff who 
oversees a dedicated team of 58 employees.
  Without the efforts of the Public Works Department, essential 
services we all rely on, like safe roads, clean public spaces and 
functional public buildings--simply could not be provided. The Anniston 
Public Works team works every day to rebuild, improve and safeguard our 
transportation systems, structures and facilities.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing National Public Works Week 
and thanking the City of Anniston&#x27;s hardworking Public Works 
professionals, engineers, managers and employees for their unwavering 
commitment to help maintain our city&#x27;s health, safety and advancing the 
quality of life.

  REMEMBERING PHILLIP LAFAYETTE GIBBS AND JAMES EARL GREEN--55 YEARS 
                                 LATER

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 23, 2025

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
memory of two young Black men--Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl 
Green--whose lives were violently taken 55 years ago on May 15, 1970, 
on the campus of Jackson State College in Jackson, Mississippi.
  Phillip Gibbs was a 21-year-old junior at Jackson State College. He 
was majoring in political science and planned to attend law school. He 
was a husband and a father to a young son, Phillip Jr. At the time of 
his death, his wife Dale was home with their child and pregnant with 
their second son, Demetrius who would never get the chance to meet his 
father.
  In the late-night hours, nearly 500 rounds of ammunition were fired 
at students gathered near Alexander Hall. Phillip Gibbs was killed 
outside the dormitory, while James Green was struck and killed across 
the street near B.F. Roberts Hall. Twelve others were wounded. The 
walls and windows of Alexander Hall still bear the scars of that night.
  Despite multiple investigations, no one was ever held accountable for 
the shootings. Local and federal probes concluded that the use of force 
was excessive and unjustified. Yet, legal doctrines shielded those 
responsible, and justice we never served.
  To this day, the names Gibbs and Green are spoken with reverence in 
Jackson and beyond. Their memory lives on in the Gibbs-Green Plaza, 
which stands where blood was once spilled--now transformed into a space 
of reflection, remembrance, and resolve. In 2021, Jackson State 
University conferred honorary degrees posthumously on both young men--
an acknowledgment of the futures they were denied.
  Mr. Speaker, on this 55th anniversary, we do more than remember--we 
reaffirm our responsibility to tell their story with truth and dignity. 
Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green were sons of Mississippi 
whose lives mattered. Their futures were stolen, but their memory fuels 
our pursuit of justice and accountability.
  Let us ensure that future generations know their names--not just as 
victims, but as young men who deserved to grow old, to dream fully, and 
to live freely.
  In honoring them today, we commit ourselves to building a nation 
where no young person&#x27;s life is met with such disregard--and where 
history is neither buried nor forgotten.
  May we speak their names, tell their story, and carry their legacy 
forward.

                          ____________________

 WELCOMING GEORGE GLEZMANN HOME TO GEORGIA&#x27;S 5TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. NIKEMA WILLIAMS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 23, 2025

  Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my 
constituent George Glezmann home from more than 2 years of wrongful 
detention by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
  George is home with his family in Atlanta in large part because of 
the tireless efforts of his wife Aleksandra. A devoted Delta airplane 
mechanic, George has an infectious zeal for life, travel, and 
experience, and I know he is eager to return to a life of normalcy and 
autonomy.
  I also want to highlight the challenges that come from extended 
wrongful detention: George has numerous medical conditions that arose 
from lack of ongoing care, and his assets have been put in 
conservatorship. The financial instability that came from George&#x27;s 
detention has resulted in him and Aleksandra losing access to stable 
housing, a challenge exacerbated by George&#x27;s ongoing conservatorship.
  I am so pleased that George is back with his family, and words cannot 
fully celebrate the work Aleksandra put in to bring her husband home. I 
look forward to George&#x27;s swift return to normalcy and autonomy with his 
loved ones, back in Atlanta where he belongs.
