    APPLICABILITY OF THE AIRLINE DEREGULATION ACT TO STATE WORKERS&#x27; 
                         COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LANCE GOODEN

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an 
important issue to both our nation&#x27;s employers and their employees; and 
that is regarding the applicability of the Airline Deregulation Act 
(ADA) to State Workers&#x27; Compensation programs. When Congress enacted 
the ADA in 1978, one of the main goals was to place maximum reliance on 
competitive market forces to help lower prices and improve efficiency, 
innovation, variety, and competition in the delivery of air 
transportation services.
  But the ADA was never intended to prohibit states from regulating 
workers&#x27; compensation systems.
  In my home state of Texas, there has been litigation on this issue 
for over a decade, and there is no end in sight. That is why Congress 
needs to step in and why I filed Amendment 300 to H.R. 3935, the 
Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act.
  My amendment, which unfortunately was not able to be made in order as 
part of the House&#x27;s consideration of H.R. 3935, would have amended the 
Airline Deregulation Act to clarify that the original intent of the ADA 
was not to preempt state workers&#x27; compensation laws with respect to 
billing and payments for air ambulance services.
  The foundation of the state workers&#x27; compensation system is 
individual state regulation of reimbursement amounts under their 
workers&#x27; compensation medical fee schedules, thereby creating cost 
transparency. In most states, this is accomplished by setting workers&#x27; 
compensation medical fee services at a percentage above what providers 
receive under Medicare.
  As a result, workers&#x27; compensation coverage is widely available to 
employers of every size across all industries; and ensures employees 
are protected from the economic impact of workplace injuries.
  Unfortunately, the protections and certainty this system affords both 
employers and workers alike started to be undermined in 2010 when 
numerous air ambulance service providers began asserting the ADA 
preempts state workers&#x27; compensation medical fee schedules, creating a 
pathway for air ambulance fees to unreasonably skyrocket.
  The preemption of state workers&#x27; compensation laws within the ADA is 
a pure accident. When Congress passed the ADA in 1978 to deregulate the 
airline industry, it certainly did not intend to deregulate workers&#x27; 
compensation insurance payments to air ambulance companies.
  As part of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act, Congress established the 
Air Ambulance and Patient Billing Advisory Committee at the Department 
of Transportation to address several issues involving air ambulance 
companies, including medical fees, consumer choice, and protecting 
consumers from balance billing. In March 2022, the Advisory Committee 
submitted its report to Congress, which included a recommendation to 
amend the ADA to clarify that it does not preempt state laws relating 
to state regulation of workers&#x27; compensation insurance programs.
  My proposed amendment to H.R. 3935 embodies the Advisory Committee&#x27;s 
recommendation and will address the accidental preemption of state 
workers&#x27; compensation laws and the inadvertent federalization of a part 
of state workers&#x27; compensation systems. This simple clarification that 
the ADA preemption provision does not apply to state workers&#x27; 
compensation payments for air ambulance services will return the issue 
to the states where it belongs, and air ambulance companies will have 
every opportunity to make their arguments on the appropriate payment 
amounts for their services within each state&#x27;s workers&#x27; compensation 
system.
  Unfortunately, my amendment was not included in the bill that was 
considered by the House, but I will continue to work with other members 
on legislation to address this important issue.

                          ____________________

                 APPRECIATING THE SERVICE OF JULIE KIM

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Julie 
Kim upon her retirement from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) 
after 33 years of dedicated public service. During this time, Ms. Kim 
advised Members, congressional staff, and committees on a wide range of 
foreign policy issues and historic world events with significant 
ramifications for the security of the United States and U.S 
geopolitical interests.
  Ms. Kim joined CRS as an Analyst in European Affairs in the immediate 
aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, at a time of momentous change 
in Europe and during a critical period in U.S. foreign policy. Ms. Kim 
covered the post-communist transitions in Eastern Europe, the break-up 
of the former Soviet Union, and the wars in the Western Balkans in the 
1990s. Through her written analysis and consultative work on topics 
ranging from U.S. foreign assistance to Central and Eastern Europe, to 
NATO and European Union enlargement, to sanctions policy and 
peacekeeping operations in the Western Balkans, Ms. Kim contributed 
immensely to the knowledge of this body and its ability to provide 
oversight and respond legislatively to the implications of these 
seismic events for European security, transatlantic relations, and U.S. 
global leadership.
  Ms. Kim also directly supported CRS&#x27; leading role in implementing the 
Frost-Solomon Task Force on the Development of Parliamentary 
Institutions for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the 
1990s. She later served as a key CRS liaison with the House Democracy 
Assistance Commission/House Democracy Partnership (HDP), which evolved 
from the work of the Frost-Solomon Task Force, and subsequently 
participated in many congressional legislative strengthening programs 
in Europe and beyond.
  For the past 19 years, Ms. Kim served in a number of managerial 
positions at CRS, including 11 years as the Section Research Manager of 
the Foreign Policy Management and Global Issues section within the 
Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division (FDT), and as Acting 
Deputy Assistant Director of FDT several times. In recent years, Ms. 
Kim headed the Europe and the Americas team of analysts, who have been 
actively engaged in advising Congress as it addresses Russian military 
aggression against Ukraine, as well as political unrest and migration 
in Latin America, among other significant foreign policy challenges. 
Ms. Kim also contributed to many CRS-wide managerial initiatives, 
including playing an integral role in managing the public release of 
CRS products and working to increase diversity and inclusion at CRS, 
including through her efforts to establish a relationship between CRS 
and the Rangel/Payne summer internship program. In all of these 
managerial posts, Ms. Kim demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and 
mentored countless new analysts and younger colleagues, leaving a 
lasting imprint and legacy of excellence and service on the CRS 
workforce.
  Please join me in expressing the gratitude of this body, and its 
appreciation on behalf of the American people, to Ms. Kim for more than 
three decades of service to CRS and the U.S. Congress. Alongside her 
CRS colleagues, family, and friends, we congratulate Ms. Kim on a 
storied and impactful career and on a well-deserved retirement.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. FLOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish David City, Nebraska a 
very happy 150th birthday.
  August 6, 1873 marks the day David City was made the county seat of 
Butler County.
  Since 1873, David City has grown and distinguished itself in many 
ways. Providing an excellent quality of life for their small town with 
exceptional education and job opportunities.
  While David City is home to just about 3,000, it&#x27;s the birthplace of 
notable people--like former U.S. Senator Roman Hruska; the founder of 
Hallmark cards, Joyce Hall; and Catholic Bishop Kenneth Steiner.
  Major employers in the City include Timpte, ADM, and David City 
Public Schools among others.
  David City is proud of its Catholic roots. Aquinas Catholic Schools 
educates many of the town&#x27;s people and St. Mary&#x27;s Church is almost as 
old as the town itself.
  As David City reaches this sesquicentennial birthday, there is much 
to celebrate.
  On behalf of the people of Nebraska&#x27;s First Congressional District, I 
congratulate David City on 150 years and wish them fun as they 
celebrate this incredible milestone.

                GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION + PUBLIC SAFETY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, I must shed light on the growing public safety concern 
regarding gun violence.
  In 2022, firearm injury was the 12th leading cause of death in the 
United States of America.
  Every day, 120 Americans are killed with guns.
  And each year, hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives 
to gun violence, having been shot to death while protecting their 
communities.
  Our government&#x27;s continued lack of proactivity towards preventing gun 
violence has led to countless, unnecessary deaths.
  Countless lives have been cut far too short, and countless families 
have had to experience the excruciating pain of knowing their loved one 
will never make it back home.
  And although gun violence affects us all, I would like to highlight 
the disproportionate effect of gun violence on Black communities.
  Black Americans are 10 times more likely than white Americans to die 
by gun homicide.
  Black Americans are three times more likely than white Americans to 
be fatally shot by police.
  And while Black Americans made up 12.5 percent of the United States 
population in 2020, they were the victims in 61 percent of all gun 
homicides.
  According to the American Progress, ``this is due to a combination of 
weak gun laws; systemic racial inequities, including unequal access to 
safe housing and adequate educational and employment opportunities; and 
a history of disinvestment in public infrastructure and services in the 
communities of color most affected by gun violence.&#x27;&#x27;
  Discriminatory and unjust policies and practices such as slavery and 
Jim Crow are the reason that Black communities are still struggling to 
overcome the inequities in our society today.
  Time and time again our country has forced Black Americans to pay the 
price for its sins, causing countless lives to be lost in the process.
  Instead of acknowledging this public safety concern, our government 
continues to choose to remain ignorant, crafting a narrative of a war 
on the Second Amendment.
  So, allow me to be clear: I support the Second Amendment.
  But I will not sit idly by and hear the abuse of the far right&#x27;s 
interpretation of the Second Amendment.
  In June 2022, the Supreme Court took a radical step when it ruled in 
New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association Inc. V. Bruen that the right 
to carry a weapon or self-defense extends to outside the home.
  In this case, plaintiffs challenged the 100-year old New York state 
handgun licensing law requiring individuals to show proper cause before 
they can be licensed to carry a concealed weapon in public.
  The Court ultimately ruled New York&#x27;s concealed carry law 
unconstitutional, extending the right to own a gun for self-defense in 
the home to exist outside the home as well.
  This decision altered the well-established test for evaluating gun 
safety laws and threatens the lives of millions around the country.
  The Court&#x27;s decision sheds light to a growing misinterpretation of 
the Second Amendment.
  As both a legislature and a legal scholar, I must point out that the 
Second Amendment is not absolute.
  No where in the Second Amendment does it prohibit regulating guns.
  How dare we sit by when lives are being lost and act as though there 
is nothing we can do?
  Is there no sense of responsibility to provide restrictions to save 
lives?
  Our role in Congress is to ensure that we utilize every tool 
available to us to keep our cities safe.
  We need to reimagine public safety by holding law enforcement 
officers who violate the public trust accountable, using public health 
resources to address mental health crises, and ensuring all communities 
are not overpoliced, well-resourced with access to job opportunities, 
affordable childcare, and capable social services to improve the 
quality of life.
  We need to increase the use of civilian responders deployed to 
incidents involving mental health concerns and disturbances or 
disputes.
  We need to strengthen governmental agencies dedicated to violence 
intervention and neighborhood safety.
  We need to pass legislation such as H.R. 52, the Kimberly Vaughn 
Firearm Safe Storage Act, a bill I introduced which establishes best 
practices for safe firearm storage to protect Americans, especially 
children, from improperly stored or misused firearms.
  We need to pass legislation, such as H.R. 48 the Gun Violence 
Reduction Resources Act of 2023, which will work to hire additional 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive agents and 
investigators to enforce gun laws.
  We need to focus on mental health and pass legislation such as H.R. 
46 the Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act, which will 
authorize funding to increase

[[Page E757]]

access to mental health care treatment to reduce gun violence.
  These bills are particularly important as it pertains to mental 
health given the following facts:
  Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America.
  More than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result 
of individuals using these weapons as a means to commit suicide.
  Approximately 1 in 4 American adults have a mental illness and nearly 
half of all adults in America will develop at least one mental illness 
during their lifetime.
  Less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health 
problems receive the treatment they need.
  Gun violence is a nonpartisan issue with bipartisan solutions.
  We act as though our hands are tied behind our back, despite the 
countless options at our disposal.
  I join my CBC colleagues in advancing common-sense bills that work to 
prevent gun violence.
  Protecting our communities and protecting our families need to be 
priority.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding musician, dedicated educator, committed community servant, 
and dear friend of longstanding, Ms. Jacqueline Saunders. She will be 
honored at the Chancel Choir&#x27;s 60th Anniversary Gospel Concert at First 
Missionary Baptist Church of Thomasville, Georgia on Sunday, August 6, 
2023.
  Jacqueline Saunders has used her life&#x27;s work to help others to reach 
their full potential through music, theatre, and education. It has been 
said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space that we 
occupy here on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; Ms. Saunders has paid her rent, and she 
has paid it well. Ms. Saunders graduated from Morris Brown College in 
1973 with a B.A. Degree in English. During her matriculation at Morris 
Brown, she was initiated into the sisterhood of Alpha Kappa Kappa 
Sorority Inc., which makes her a Golden Soror. She was also a member of 
the Morris Brown College Wolverine Marching Band.
  Her love of knowledge and learning took her academic pursuits to the 
University of Georgia, Valdosta State College (Now University), Walden 
University, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she received 
her M.S. in Counseling Education in 1988.

[[Page E758]]

  Ms. Saunders has had a long and storied career as an educator that 
began in 1973. She has served in many roles during her professional 
career to include, Instructor of English and Social Studies, English 
Language and Literature Instructor, Instructor of English 
Communications, Career Advisor Coordinator/Career Adviser, Counselor/

professional stops during her educational journey have included Brooks 
County Junior High School, Thomas County, Turn Around School, The 
University of Wisconsin, Thomas County Central High School, Thomas 
University, Thomasville High School, and J.K. Harper Elementary School. 
Ms. Saunders had a brief respite from her educational career from 1984 
to 86 where she served in several roles at National Savings and Trust 
Bank in Washington, D.C. but she quickly returned to her first love of 
education.
  A wonderful woman of God, Ms. Saunders served as Church Musician for 
Ochlocknee and Piney Grove Missionary Baptist Churches from 1959-69. 
From 1959 through the present, she has served as a Church musician for 
Mercy Seat Christian and First Missionary Baptist Churches. She also 
has been a member of the acclaimed Georgia Mass Choir since 1981.
  In addition, she has expanded her horizons in the performing arts by 
appearing in the 1996 movie, ``The Preacher&#x27;s Wife,&#x27;&#x27; which starred 
Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston, and she also appeared in the 
Broadway play ``Why Do Good Girls Like Bad Boys?&#x27;&#x27; She has also 
broadened her horizons by traveling and participating in an 
international tour of France, England, Spain, and Italy.
  Amidst all her other activities, she has always found time to give 
back to her community. ``It has been said that service is the rent we 
pay for the space we occupy on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; Jacqueline Saunders has 
paid her rent, and she has paid it well! Through her beloved Alpha 
Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., she has given her time, treasure, and talent 
to many community initiatives. Ms. Saunders founded the Lambda Xi 
Chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and served as its Basileus 
from 1977 to 79 and 1992 to 93. She is an example of what can happen 
when 1 carries out God&#x27;s purpose for her life.
  Jacqueline Saunders has exemplified a life of service to God using 
her many talents to touch the lives of countless souls fortunate enough 
to cross paths with her. She has done so much for so many for so long.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join my wife Vivian, and I, 
along with the members of the Chancel Choir, First Missionary Baptist 
Church of Thomasville, Georgia, as well as the 765,000 people of the 
Second Congressional District, in honoring and commending Ms. 
Jacqueline Sanders for her commitments to God, her community, and to 
humankind.

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Sisay Senbet on 
receiving the Tom Miller Advocacy Award for his outstanding work and 
self-advocacy in Didlake&#x27;s AbilityOne Program, a federal program that 
creates employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.
  Sisay immigrated to the District of Columbia from Ethiopia in 2010 
and started working for Didlake as a custodian at the Pentagon in 2012. 
In 2015, he started working the night shift so he could enroll in 
college. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2019.
  Shortly after obtaining his college degree, Sisay was promoted to 
Site Safety and Health Officer. In his new role, he conducted work 
inspections and trained new employees in the proper use of safety 
equipment. Last September, he was promoted to Lead Worker and is now 
responsible for coordinating and leading the Pentagon custodial crew&#x27;s 
day-to-day-operations.
  In his spare time, Sisay volunteers at his community library, 
teaching classes and tutoring other individuals with disabilities. In 
particular, he helps people with visual impairments use screen reading 
software to access digital information.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to recognize Sisay 
Senbet, whose life and career are a source of inspiration for both 
immigrants and individuals with disabilities.

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and 
legacy of Fort Worth native Joseph Garnett Scott, otherwise 
affectionately known by many as ``Coach Scott&#x27;&#x27; by many in the 
community.
  Joe was a pillar of our community and was well-known around Fort 
Worth as 1 of the most dapper and well-dressed men in the city. Joe was 
born in 1953 and was a member of New Mt. Carmel Baptist Church for many 
years. Joe got his education in the Fort Worth Independent School 
District and graduated from Polytechnic High School, where he was an 
all-district athlete in football and track. He would go on to earn his 
bachelor&#x27;s degree at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas; 
there, he continued a successful football career as a 3-year starter. 
He obtained his master&#x27;s degree at Tarleton State University in 
Stephenville, Texas.
  Joe spent many years serving our community as a teacher. He started 
his career in the Fort Worth Independent School District as a Physical 
Education teacher assistant and track coach at William James Middle 
School, where his team was successful and won many awards on the track. 
He then became a Physical Education teacher and head football, track, 
and soccer coach at Wedgwood Middle School, where his teams were both 
dominant on the field and track. He would later transition to high 
school as a ninth-grade English teacher and football and track coach at 
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. He was known by many for having a 
gift for forming positive relationships with his students and athletes.
  Joe&#x27;s first administrative position as an Assistant Principal at 
Handley Middle School, where he consistently supported leadership, 
students, faculty, and staff. Joe then progressed to an Assistant 
Principal at Dunbar High School. As a high school assistant principal, 
his days were filled with working with students and faculty, along with 
attending many games and activities throughout the school year. Joe&#x27;s 
first principalship was at Dunbar 6th Grade Center. Joe thought it was 
most important that the building reflected a safe, welcoming, and 
attractive learning environment at all times. For the next 10 years, he 
was fortunate enough to become principal of his alma mater, Polytechnic 
High School. His years as the instructional leader of the Poly Parrot 
Community brought years of hard work. determination, and 
accomplishments. After this, for the next several years, his love for 
fashion and style led him to work in the retail industry. Soon after, 
he felt a strong desire to return to the world of education as a 
substitute teacher and administrator, where he continued to touch many 
lives throughout the district.
  Joe was also a family man who was a loving husband and father. He was 
always the life of the party, cracking jokes and enjoying whatever food 
had been prepared. He was also known for being a ``Master&#x27;&#x27; Gardener. 
He spent endless hours planting flowers and consistently maintaining a 
manicured yard. He put just as much thought into planning his daily 
coordinated ``outfits&#x27;&#x27;. He is survived by his loving wife of 43 years, 
Patricia Scott, his children, Tracy Carter, Kena Nicole Knox Brown, 
Evin Scott, and Whitney Scott; grandchildren Maxine, Connor, and 
London, Aunt, Willie B Jones, Great-Aunt Macie Bonner and a host of 
relatives and friends. May his memory live on forever.

            HONORING THOMAS (TOMMY) CHRISTOPHER CHATMON, JR.

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.-

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize, a 
dedicated servant leader, seasoned business executive, faithful civil 
rights activist, great strategic thinker, loving husband, committed 
father, and friend of longstanding, Thomas (Tommy) Christopher Chatmon, 
Jr. Sadly, Tommy transitioned this life from labor to reward on July 
22, 2023. A homegoing service celebrating his remarkable life will be 
held on Saturday, August 5, 2023, at The Mount Zion Missionary Baptist 
Church in Albany, Georgia.
  Thomas (Tommy) Chistopher Chatmon, Jr was born in Albany, Georgia, on 
December 19, 1954, the third of 5 children to the late Thomas C. 
Chatmon, Sr., and Alma Chatmon. Raised in a God-fearing family, he 
became a member of Bethel AME Church, where he was a lifelong member 
and sang in the choir. His first fruits of education came as a student 
at the Hazard Laboratory School for Primary Education and St. Teresa&#x27;s 
Catholic School in Albany. Tommy was also a product of the Dougherty 
County School System, graduating from Albany High School in 1972. Tommy 
made history while at Albany High School, becoming the marching band&#x27;s 
first African American drum major. His love of music continued, and he 
delayed college after graduating with honors to travel with a band 
called Eden from 1968 to 1974.
  In 1974, Tommy followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by attending our 
Alma Mater, Morehouse College. He graduated from Morehouse in 1979 with 
a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science. One of Tommy&#x27;s proudest 
moments at Morehouse was when he was selected to serve as a U.S. 
Congressional Intern, in the office of United States Congresswoman 
Cardiss Hortense Collins.
  After graduating from Morehouse, Tommy returned to his hometown roots 
in Albany to operate a family-owned business, Chatmon&#x27;s Beauty Supply, 
Inc. He was a great strategic entrepreneur and as Chief Operating 
Officer for 17 years, he helped grow the family business to 10 retail 
locations in 4 different states.

[[Page E755]]

Tommy&#x27;s professional career also took him to work as the District 
Manager for the Georgia Census Bureau in 1980. In 1984, he was the 
Campaign Manager for Standup Strain&#x27;s bid for Dougherty County Sheriff. 
Tommy cemented his bonafides during this time as a deeply respected 
political figure and social activist, once again following in the 
footsteps of his father; who had been active in the Albany Civil Rights 
Movement.
  In 1998, when leaders in Albany decided to revitalize the city&#x27;s 
downtown area by forming Albany Tomorrow, Inc., Tommy was selected to 
serve as its Executive Director. Forever a visionary and forward 
thinker, he was able to bring people and projects together for downtown 
to include the Hilton Garden Inn, The Flint River Aquarium, The Ray 
Charles Plaza, Turtle Grove Park, SKATE Park, The Albany Law 
Enforcement Center and Police Headquarters, Department of Human 
Resources Administrative Building, The Central Square, The Science 
Discovery Children&#x27;s Museum, parking garages for the downtown business 
district, and The Dougherty County School Board Administrative 
Building. Tommy&#x27;s proudest moment as the Executive Director was the 
groundbreaking of the Albany Civil Rights Institute, which tells the 
story of Albany&#x27;s prominent role in the modern-day Civil Rights 
Movement. As his good friend Glenn Singfield put it, ``There wouldn&#x27;t 
be an Albany today without Albany Tomorrow, and there wouldn&#x27;t have 
been an Albany Tomorrow without Tommy Chatmon.&#x27;&#x27;
  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, ``Faith is sometimes taking 
the first step without seeing the full staircase.&#x27;&#x27; In 2007, Thomas 
took a step on faith with the lessons he learned in his stint with 
Albany Tomorrow carrying his creative talents to Orlando, Florida, 
where the mayor appointed him as Executive Director of the Downtown 
Development Board/Community Redevelopment Agency. In this role, Tommy 
oversaw economic development for the Community Redevelopment Agency. He 
played a crucial role in achieving some of downtown Orlando&#x27;s premier 
development in retail and business recruitment, marketing and special 
events programming, and housing development within the Community 
Redevelopment Area to include:
  The Amway Center, The Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, 
Sun Rail, Chase,&#x27; Plaza, Church Street Plaza, Citi Tower, Creative 
Village, 55 West, and many more.
  It has been said that ``service is the rent that we pay for the space 
that we occupy here on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; Tommy Chatmon paid his rent, and 
he paid it well. He gave his time, talent, and treasure to numerous 
social and civil organizations, serving as Chair of Homeless Service 
Network of Central Florida Board, and the Starter Studio Board, The 
International Downtown Association (IDA), Nap Ford Community School, 
MyRegion.ORG, WMFW Community Advisory Board, and the Central Florida 
Urban League Board.
  Tommy has been honored for his dedicated Community service to include 
Orlando&#x27;s ``10 Businessmen to Watch&#x27;&#x27; and Orlando Magazine&#x27;s ``50 Most 
Powerful People&#x27;&#x27;, Georgia Trend Magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential 
Georgians, Martin Luther King Celebration Leadership Award, and the 
Leadership Albany Outstanding Alumni Award.
  Tommy accomplished much in his life, but none of it would have been 
possible without the grace of God, the love and support of his 
elementary school sweetheart, his beloved wife Brenetta, and his three 
children, Yvonne, Brittany, and Cory.
  On a personal note, Tommy was my friend, my Morehouse brother, and 
longtime supporter. Over the years, he gave me wise counsel, for which 
I will be forever grateful. Likewise, during his life, Tommy did so 
much for so many for so long. He touched countless lives, and because 
he did, the world is a better place.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife Vivian and me, along 
with the 765,000 people of the 2nd Congressional District, in extending 
our deepest condolences to the family of Mr. Thomas Christopher 
Chatmon, Jr., his family, friends, and all who mourn his loss. May we 
all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit 
in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

                          ____________________

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, on June 22, 2023, I was unavoidably detained. 
Had I been present, I would have voted ``NAY&#x27;&#x27; on rollcall No. 285.
  I strongly oppose H. Res. 529, a resolution to refer H. Res. 503 from 
the House floor to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee 
on the Judiciary. That resolution impeaches President Joe Biden for 
high crimes and misdemeanors relating to actions taken that involve 
immigration and the southern border. President Biden continues to lead 
with integrity and has done more than any other President to combat 
substance use disorder and address the mental health crisis. In the 
absence of Congressional action, I have been heartened to work with the 
Biden Administration to make significant and meaningful reforms to 
address the immigration challenges facing our Nation. Rather than 
consider legislation that is purely politically driven, it is my hope 
that we get back to the serious work of legislating on the real issues 
our country faces. for the People.
  I also would have voted ``NAY&#x27;&#x27; on rollcall No. 286. I strongly 
oppose H. Res. 461. condemning the use of elementary and secondary 
school facilities to provide shelter for aliens who are not admitted to 
the United States. Migrants deserve to be treated with dignity and 
respect, and I commend anyone who follows the Golden Rule and finds 
shelter for those most in need.

   RECOGNIZING LOGAN LANGEMEIER FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
                            REPRESENTATIVES

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated 
staffer who is moving on to a new venture. After graduating from 
Georgia Southern University with a degree in accounting, Logan came to 
my Congressional office as an intern. Although he is originally from 
South Lake Tahoe, Nevada, he quickly became an honorary Georgian.
  Logan was college football starter for 3 years at Georgia Southern. 
He was named on Sun Belt Conference Academic Commissioner&#x27;s List and 
the Sun Belt Conference Academic Honor Role.
  Logan has a strong desire to serve, and an even stronger dedication 
to this country. Despite having a job offer in hand after graduation, 
Logan chose to come to D.C. to work as an intern, and immediately made 
an impact on our office.
  When the opportunity arose for Logan to join the staff of my House 
Administration subcommittee, he didn&#x27;t hesitate. He saw it as another 
opportunity to serve--and he has been invaluable from day 1.
  Logan is moving on to the next phase of his life, where he will begin 
his career in accounting. Logan has left a lasting impression on our 
entire team and will be impossible to replace; but I am grateful for 
his service, and I look forward to seeing him continue to succeed as he 
enters his new role.

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 
achievements of Miss Jessica Thompson, a resident of Middletown, 
Maryland and member of the Frederick County Knucklers marble shooting 
team. On June 22, 2023, Miss Thompson won the 100th Annual National 
Marbles Tournament. In addition to winning the top title in the girls&#x27; 
division, she won the honor of Good Sportsmanship. These titles earned 
her a college scholarship.
  As this year marks the 100th annual tournament, it is regarded as the 
oldest children&#x27;s competitive sport in the United States, having 
started in 1922. During the week of June 22nd, young girls and boys 
from all across the nation gathered to participate in tournaments, 
engaging in over 1,200 games of Ringer. Throughout the intense three-
day event, Jessica displayed her exceptional skills by competing in 
more than 100 games. With determination and skill, she clinched the 
championship.
  It is with great pride that Maryland&#x27;s sixth district welcomes the 
Queen of Marbles home to Middletown, and we wish her continued success 
in all of her endeavors.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JERROLD NADLER

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, August 4, 2023

  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the Honorable 
Cynthia Doty, long time resident of the Upper West Side, political 
activist, and Democratic District Leader, who passed away in Manhattan 
at the age of 72 on July 17, 2023.
  I first met Cynthia 30 years ago working in local Democratic 
politics. I worked alongside her former boss Assemblymember Ed Sullivan 
in the New York State Assembly. Cynthia served 9 years as his 
Legislative Associate and Special Assistant. In Albany, she drafted 
legislation and negotiated budgets. In the district, she advocated on 
behalf of thousands of constituents to protect their housing and 
deliver needed services.
  Cynthia was a major force in the Three Parks Independent Democrats 
political club and served as its President and as District Leader. 
Cynthia was kind, honest, and skilled at her position, and was both 
respected and beloved within the community. She was extremely 
reliable--if she said she was going to get something done, it would 
always get done--and she was a gracious host to me and others who 
visited her political club frequently. Under her leadership, the club 
members were very active in gathering petition signatures and 
mobilizing the vote in our area for countless elected officials at all 
levels of politics from District Leader to Congressman, Senator, and 
President. Cynthia and her club did the work to help get Democrats 
elected across the country--not just in New York--and organized bus 
trips to Connecticut and Pennsylvania to get out the votes. She ran 
phone banks that reached voters across the country and was always 
finding ways for volunteers to get involved and fight for causes they 
believed in. She was my guest at both inaugurations of President Obama 
and frequently attended marches and protests on the National Mall in 
Washington, D.C. She opposed the war in Iraq, supported a woman&#x27;s right 
to choose, and defended LGBTQ+ rights. She supported community farms 
and was a member of a CSA (community supported agriculture) where she 
enjoyed volunteering.
  Cynthia was born into a Democratic family in Philadelphia in 1951, 
where she developed her progressive principles and a deep commitment to 
public service. Cynthia went to public school, co-chaired the racial 
justice committee at her college, and led several college groups to 
Washington to protest the Vietnam War. Her parents were active in 
politics--her father, Ethan Allen Doty, served as a judge for over 40 
years and was a leading figure in the Democratic reform movement. Her 
mother, Beatrice Graham Doty, was a Democratic State Committeewoman. 
Her brothers, Ed Doty and Warren Doty, both served in elected positions 
in Pelham, New York and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts respectively.
  Cynthia was not only into politics. She spent 20 years as a 
theatrical costume designer in major productions that appeared on 
Broadway, at Lincoln Center, and at the Kennedy Center in Washington, 
D.C. She worked in film on The Wiz with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, 
in opera with the 3 tenors--Jose Carreras, Luciano Pavarotti, and 
Placido Domingo, and on Broadway in the production of ``On Your Toes&#x27;&#x27;. 
After many of her friends passed away due to the AIDS epidemic, Cynthia 
was moved to return to community service and work for social justice.
  It was her passion for justice and her willingness to fight for what 
she believed in that helped her inspire others to participate in the 
political process and be motivated to go out and vote.
  It is entirely fitting that she ended her political career as the 
Manhattan Deputy Chief Clerk at the New York City Board of Elections. 
In that role, she oversaw a vast operation of election officials 
responsible for processing ballots during several tumultuous changes in 
New York State election law. She oversaw ``early voting&#x27;&#x27; efforts that 
allow people to vote before election day and efforts to ensure absentee 
or vote by mail ballots were processed properly during the COVID-19 
epidemic. She helped ensure polling places were open and accessible and 
people knew where and how to vote.
  In, perhaps, her last major election, she was involved in processing 
my own re-election in a contested primary in Manhattan. She was the 
consummate professional and made sure the election was carried out 
without controversy. Too often we take for granted the work people like 
Cynthia do to help our communities, but we would be remiss if we did 
not honor and thank her and her team for a job well done.
  I enjoyed working with Cynthia over the past 30 to 40 years. Her 
contributions to her community knew no end. The people of Manhattan&#x27;s 
Upper West Side will miss her deeply but know that we will continue to 
carry out the work that she cared about so deeply. We will continue to 
work for social justice, environmental justice, women&#x27;s rights, LGBTQ+ 
rights, and health care for all. I thank her for her years of service. 
May she rest in peace. And may her memory be a blessing to us all.
