              CELEBRATING DIWALI THIS HINDU HERITAGE MONTH

                                  _____
                                 

                         HON. SUHAS SUBRAMANYAM

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 21, 2025

  Mr. SUBRAMANYAM. Mr. Speaker, Hinduism is the third largest religion 
in the world, and this month, millions of Americans will come together 
to celebrate Diwali, or Deepavali, the festival of lights.
  Diwali, symbolizing unity and renewal, marks the victory of light 
over darkness and is a significant cultural and spiritual celebration, 
observed by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and others in the United States and 
across the globe.
  Virginia, and the United States as a whole, is home to a vibrant and 
thriving Hindu community. Hindu Americans contribute meaningfully 
across sectors, including business, law, government, technology, 
medicine, science, education, and philanthropy.
  Several states, including the Commonwealth of Virginia, have passed 
legislation to officially proclaim October as Hindu Heritage Month.
  I encourage residents across the Commonwealth and the country to join 
in celebrating Diwali and take this opportunity to learn more about 
Hindu American civic engagement, history, traditions, and culture.
  In this spirit, I join those across the country in celebrating 
October as Hindu Heritage Month. May this Diwali bring joy, light, and 
prosperity to all those who celebrate.

                          ____________________

                       Tuesday, October 21, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Judge Terrye Davis, 
a distinguished leader and trailblazer, as one of California&#x27;s 8th 
Congressional District&#x27;s Women of the Year. Her visionary leadership 
and lifelong commitment to service have strengthened the fabric of 
Solano County for decades. Judge Davis began her career as the Founding 
Director of the Solano College Small Business Development Center, where 
she empowered entrepreneurs and expanded pathways to economic 
opportunity across our region. She later served as Executive Director 
of the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club, where under her 
guidance the organization&#x27;s budget grew more than fivefold, allowing 
countless young people to access a safe and supportive environment to 
learn, grow, and thrive. Today, Judge Davis serves with distinction on 
the Solano County Superior Court, where she presides over juvenile 
justice and dependency cases. In this critical role, she brings 
compassion, integrity, and structure to some of our community&#x27;s most 
vulnerable youth, offering not just legal judgment but also hope and a 
path forward. Her dedication to public service extends well beyond the 
courtroom. She has contributed her leadership to the Sutter Solano 
Medical Center, the City of Vallejo Human Relations Commission, the 
Mare Island Reuse Advisory Committee, and the Board of Trustees at her 
local church. Judge Davis&#x27;s journey is a testament to courage and 
purpose. Leaving behind a successful nonprofit career to pursue her 
dream of becoming an attorney, she graduated from UC Hastings and rose 
to the bench, proving that it&#x27;s never too late to follow one&#x27;s calling. 
On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District, I 
am proud to recognize and honor Judge Terrye Davis for her 
extraordinary contributions to our community.

                       Tuesday, October 21, 2025

  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kim Castaneda, 
recognized as one of California&#x27;s 8th Congressional District&#x27;s Women of 
the Year. Kim has demonstrated extraordinary leadership and a lifelong 
dedication to building stronger, more equitable communities throughout 
Solano County. For more than twenty-five years, Ms. Castaneda has 
exemplified what it means to serve others. Through her work in the 
nonprofit sector, she has guided organizations through growth, crisis, 
and transformation, with a focus on ensuring that the most vulnerable 
are not left behind. As Vice President of Development and 
Communications at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano, Ms. 
Castaneda has raised millions of dollars to fight hunger and played an 
instrumental role in doubling private donations, ensuring that 
thousands of families have consistent access to nutritious food. Her 
leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was especially remarkable. At a 
time when food insecurity reached unprecedented levels, she rallied 
staff, volunteers, and community partners to secure critical resources 
and distribute millions of additional meals.
  Under her guidance, the Food Bank never turned anyone away and 
continues today to serve more than 65,000 households each month. She 
was also a founding board member of the Vacaville Recreation Foundation 
and helped establish the first Boys and Girls Club in Vacaville, 
expanding opportunities for local youth that endure to this day. She 
has also served on the Board of SafeQuest Solano, supporting survivors 
of domestic violence and sexual assault. Her commitment to equity and 
inclusion is reflected in her advocacy for LGBTQ rights, foster youth, 
and women&#x27;s empowerment, and in her leadership roles with key 
organizations including the Solano Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the 
Solano Economic Development Council, and the Travis Credit Union 
Foundation. In each of these, she has championed small business 
development, workforce opportunities, and economic inclusion. Her work 
stands as a testament to

the power of service-driven leadership, and the lasting impact one 
person can make. On behalf of the people of California&#x27;s 8th 
Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Kim 
Castaneda for her invaluable contributions to our community.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and honor Ms. TaKayla Pratt, an accomplished healthcare professional 
whose dedication, faith, and perseverance have made a lasting impact on 
both her patients and her community.
  Ms. Pratt has been employed at The Medical Center for six years,

University for Women with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
  Her colleagues speak highly of her commitment and growth. Terri 
Donham, Nurse Manager of Surgery, PACU, and SPD, stated, ``Watching 
Kayla expand her knowledge base over the years has been awesome. She 
has grown from the shy, quiet young woman that applied for a scrub tech 
position to a nurse that takes amazing care of her patients when they 
come to the operating room.&#x27;&#x27; Similarly, Chrissy Nicholson, Chief Human 
Resources Officer, shared, ``Congratulations to TaKayla on earning her 
BSN and becoming a registered nurse! We are incredibly proud of her 
achievement and grateful to have her on our team.&#x27;&#x27;
  Ms. Pratt credits her success to the supportive and family-oriented 
environment at The Medical Center, where she continues to grow

most critical moments. She is also a proud member of Beulah Grove M.B. 
Church of Leland, Mississippi, where her values of service, faith, and 
community have been nurtured.
  Outside of her professional life, Ms. Pratt enjoys traveling, 
exploring new restaurants, and spending quality time with family and

TaKayla Pratt for her outstanding accomplishments, her dedication to 
her patients, and her service to the community. Her story is a true 
reflection of perseverance, faith, and the power of service.

three years of service, he retired from the Naval Reserves on September

       INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING EQUITY 
                           ACCOUNTABILITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 21, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Government 
Advertising Equity Accountability Act, which would require all federal 
agencies to include in their annual budget requests to Congress the 
amount they spend on advertising contracts with small disadvantaged 
businesses (SDBs) and businesses owned by minorities and women. Federal 
agencies would be required to provide prior and projected total 
expenditures for such contracts. At my request, the Committee on 
Appropriations has required many federal agencies to provide such 
information each of the last several years, but this bill would codify 
this requirement and apply it to all federal agencies.
  In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined spending 
on advertising contracts with minority-owned businesses by five federal 
agencies--the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, 
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the 
Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--and 
found that only five percent of the $4.3 billion available for 
advertising contracts went to minority-owned businesses. In light of 
these concerning findings, I, along with several other Members of 
Congress, sent letters to GAO in 2016 and 2022 requesting updated 
information on the amount of federal advertising dollars spent with 
SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women. In 2018 and 2024, 
GAO issued reports on the amount of federal advertising dollars spent 
with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women. The 2024 report 
revealed that only 15 percent of federal advertising contract 
obligations went to SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women. 
The federal government is one of the largest advertisers in the United 
States, and it has an obligation to ensure equitable access to its 
contracts for SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women. GAO&#x27;s 
findings demonstrate that there is still much progress to be made.

[[Page E989]]

  The regular collection of information on federal advertising 
contracts with SDBs and businesses owned by women and minorities is 
essential to bridging the gap between what current statistics show and 
a more inclusive advertising landscape. This bill would help achieve 
this goal while also promoting transparency and encouraging federal 
agencies to strive to reach minorities, who often receive the news from 
smaller media outlets that serve communities of color. The requirement 
that agencies submit prior and projected information on the amount of 
advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities 
and women would allow federal agencies to evaluate their progress. The 
regular collection of this information would also demonstrate that the 
promotion of equity in advertising and in all areas of government, is a 
continuous effort and is important to the mission of every federal 
agency.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 21, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the 100th anniversary of Solebury School, located in beautiful New 
Hope, Pennsylvania. Solebury School has been a cornerstone of 
independent education in Bucks County, known for its close-knit 
community, academic excellence, and commitment to fostering 
intellectual curiosity and character in young people.
  Solebury School was founded in 1925 by four visionary educators, 
Laurie Erskine, Julian Lathrop, Robert Shaw, and Arthur ``Doc&#x27;&#x27; 
Washburn, who shared a dream of creating a new kind of educational 
environment. As the school&#x27;s first headmaster, Doc Washburn captured 
that vision best when he wrote, ``Our goal is to start a small school 
with an informal atmosphere, where the needs of each boy would be 
attended to, where friendship between teachers and pupils would be 
encouraged, and where a boy would be prepared not only for college, but 
for life beyond high school.&#x27;&#x27;
  From those humble beginnings, Solebury School opened its doors in 
rented quarters in September 1925 with just four boys and four 
teachers. One year later, the founders purchased the historic Michener 
Farm, establishing the permanent campus that continues to serve 
generations of students to this day.
  Just down the road from Solebury stood the Holmquist School for 
Girls, founded in 1917 by Miss Karline Holmquist, who shared a similar 
belief that education should help each student discover and develop her 
unique talents and capabilities. As both schools grew, they often 
collaborated, sharing theatrical productions, musical performances, 
proms, teas, and community gatherings. In 1949, these two institutions 
united to form one of the first coeducational independent schools in 
the Nation: Solebury School, as we know it today.
  On October 1, 2025, Solebury marked 100 years since its first day of 
classes. Over the past century, Solebury School has remained steadfast 
in its founding ideals such as personal attention, intellectual 
curiosity, and a deep respect for individuality. The school&#x27;s faculty, 
students, and alumni continue to embody these values, carrying forward 
the founders&#x27; dream of education that not only prepares young people 
for college, but also for meaningful, purposeful lives beyond the 
classroom.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 1st Congressional District of 
Pennsylvania, I am proud to commend Solebury School for one hundred 
years of distinguished service to education and community. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in extending heartfelt congratulations to the 
faculty, staff, alumni, and families of Solebury School as they 
celebrate this extraordinary milestone and continue their inspiring 
journey into the next century of learning, leadership, and community.

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, October 21, 2025

  Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the 
service of Victorville City Councilwoman Debra Jones. During her nearly 
fourteen years of dedicated public service, Debra has advocated 
tirelessly for the Victorville community and its citizens&#x27; most 
pressing concerns. Debra is renowned in our community as a selfless and 
caring servant and is a true friend to all who have the privilege of 
knowing her.
  Elected to the City Council in November 2018 and sworn into office 
the following month, she went on to serve as Mayor from December 2020 
through December 2023. Debra was instrumental in championing Measure P, 
which expanded law enforcement, strengthened code enforcement, and led 
to the development of a new police station and civic plaza, enhancing 
public safety and revitalizing the city&#x27;s core. She also helped 
establish the Victorville Wellness Center, the first facility of its 
kind in San Bernardino County, which reduced the city&#x27;s unsheltered 
homeless population by fifty-seven percent and now serves as a model 
for other communities.
  In addition to her work in public office, Debra has been deeply 
involved in education and community service. She co-founded the 
Adelanto Elementary School District&#x27;s first Special Education Parent 
Advisory Committee, served two terms on its Governing Board, and has 
devoted herself to volunteerism, philanthropic writing, and foster 
parenting--particularly for infants prenatally exposed to illicit 
drugs.
  Debra has also represented Victorville on numerous regional boards 
and commissions, including the San Bernardino County Transportation 
Authority, the San Bernardino Council of Governments, and the Victor 
Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority. Her service on these bodies 
has been marked by professionalism, collaboration, and a deep 
commitment to transparency and good governance.
  Debra&#x27;s accomplishments would not have been possible without the 
support of her family. Her husband, Gene, and their six children have 
stood by her side throughout her many years of public service and 
community leadership.
  Debra has had a profound impact on the Victorville community. Heather 
and I deeply appreciate her years of service, and we wish her and her 
family well as she enters this next stage of her already eventful and 
purposeful life. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Councilwoman Debra Jones and celebrating her retirement.
