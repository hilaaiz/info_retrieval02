               COMMEMORATING NATIONAL HERITAGE ACADEMIES

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. BILL HUIZENGA

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate National 
Heritage Academies, or NHA as they are known, as they celebrate their 
30th anniversary.
  It is critical that every child, regardless of income, background, or 
zip code, has access to a quality education. National Heritage 
Academies delivers on this goal!
  NHA prepares students from all walks of life for academic success 
while opening doors to trade schools, community colleges, and four-year 
universities.
  Since 1995, National Heritage Academies has offered quality education 
opportunities to more than 60,000 K-12 students. NHA runs over 100 
charter schools primarily in my home state of Michigan, but has also 
expanded into 8 additional states.
  One of those schools in Michigan is Vanderbilt Charter Academy in 
Holland, Michigan, where I served on the board for 5 years. Charter 
schools provide families with a tuition-free alternative that offers 
greater choice in the education their children receive.
  National Heritage Academies strives to put kids on a trajectory to 
reach their full potential and achieve success both in and out of the 
classroom.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating National Heritage 
Academies as they celebrate their 30th anniversary.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Ganado 
Maidens softball team--2025 UIL 2A State Champions.
  With a final score of 5-4 over Riesel, the Maidens capped off a 33-5-
1 season marked by grit, discipline, and heart. They entered the 
postseason on a 19-game winning streak and held their opponents to just 
9 total runs across 10 playoff games.
  This championship wasn&#x27;t handed to them. In the title game, they were 
down to their final out then delivered a two-run rally that turned the 
tide. That&#x27;s the kind of resilience that defines Texas athletics and 
Texas values.
  It wasn&#x27;t just one team on the field--it was an entire community 
behind them. Coaches, families, classmates, and neighbors, each playing 
a role. As one local paper put it, ``lt took all of Ganado.&#x27;&#x27; And it 
did.
  In a time when the spotlight so often falls on the wrong examples, 
these young women reminded us what it means to fight for something 
bigger than yourself. Their victory is more than a trophy. It&#x27;s a 
testament to hard work, unity, and the enduring spirit of Texas.
  I congratulate the Maidens.

                        HONORING HEATHER MILLETT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CHUCK EDWARDS

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Heather 
Millett, who has served with distinction as Legislative Director in 
both my state senate and congressional offices. Heather embodies the 
very best of public service. You will see from her educational 
background that for years she has been preparing for a career dedicated 
to serving the citizens of our great Nation. By earning her Bachelor&#x27;s 
Degree in Political Science at Campbell University, her Master of 
Public Administration and Policy at American University, and continuing 
her education in law studies at Syracuse University College of Law, it 
becomes evident that Heather&#x27;s long-term goal has been a passion to 
help improve the lives of others.
  Heather&#x27;s intelligence, integrity, and tireless work ethic have 
guided our legislative efforts with purpose and precision. Whether 
navigating the complexities of committee work, building coalitions 
across the aisle, or championing the priorities of our constituents, 
Heather has brought both strategic insight and deep compassion to every 
task.
  Perhaps Heather&#x27;s most important contribution to the people of North 
Carolina&#x27;s Eleventh Congressional District was after September 27, 
2024, when Hurricane Helene made landfall in the peaceful and serene 
mountains of Western North Carolina. Without ever being asked, Heather 
took the initiative and went into overdrive, working tirelessly for 
several consecutive weeks, night and day, with no days off, to bring 
hope, resources, and lifesaving assistance to tens of thousands of 
victims affected by this once-in-a-millennium weather event. Each day 
for several weeks, Heather authored and distributed vital emails to a 
devastated population to help them find food, water, shelter, locate 
missing loved ones, and understand which roads were open for escape, 
along with countless other pieces of helpful information for those 
seeking rescue. During this time, when I encouraged Heather to take a 
few days away with her family for some planned time months earlier, her 
response was, ``District Eleven needs me now,&#x27;&#x27; and she continued for 
many weeks to absorb more and more of the recovery workload. She 
persisted for weeks, coordinating the efforts of FEMA, 
telecommunications companies, utility companies, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the Federal 
Highway Administration, local governments, our district team, 
individual constituents, and an endless list of others. Heather worked 
quietly behind the scenes out of the public&#x27;s eye, but was chiefly 
responsible for the praise and accolades that my office received for 
our response to this natural disaster.
  Mr. Speaker, Heather Millett should always be recognized as a 
Hurricane Helene Hero, and I am honored to share these words to honor 
her unforgettable, lasting contribution and to express my deepest 
appreciation for her service to the people of Western North Carolina. 
As Legislative Director, Heather played a key role in shaping my 
office&#x27;s policy agenda and making sure that the voices of the people we 
serve were heard in Congress. Her expertise has made a meaningful and 
lasting impact on many Americans, especially in areas she cares most 
about, such as infrastructure projects, veterans&#x27; benefits and 
healthcare, voter integrity, economic development, and reducing 
regulations. Heather provided the genius behind many essential pieces 
of legislation, like the Equal Representation Act, the Promoting 
Resilient Buildings Act, the Justice for America&#x27;s Veterans and 
Survivors Act, and many others. In just two and a half years working 
beside me, a new member of Congress, Heather has authored five pieces 
of legislation that have now become law--five phenomenal 
accomplishments, and I expect many other pieces of her work will soon 
become law. Another remarkable achievement of Heather&#x27;s that leaves a 
lasting mark on history is her skillful and masterful navigation of the 
Congressional appropriations and grants processes to secure tens of 
millions of dollars for essential infrastructure and needs for NC-11. 
While the numerous buildings, dams, equipment, and other projects that 
will improve and save the lives of the people I represent may never 
bear her name, many of us will see them throughout our lives and know 
Heather played a key role in securing them.
  On behalf of all of us, I thank Heather for her leadership, her 
loyalty, the example she has set, her steadfast service, and dedication 
to my district, as well as her lasting impact on the Congress of the 
United States. We wish her all the best in her future endeavors and 
hope she takes with her pride in a job extraordinarily well done.

                      HONORING MS. YOLANDA AMADEO

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a distinguished 
scholar, passionate community advocate, and dedicated educator, Ms. 
Yolanda Amadeo, who celebrated her 30th anniversary as Chief 
Meteorologist at WALB-TV in Albany, Georgia, on June 15, 2025.
  Ms. Amadeo graduated from Jackson State University with a Bachelor of 
Science in Atmospheric Sciences and also earned a Bachelor of Science 
in Speech Communications from Florida State University. She proudly 
holds the prestigious American Meteorological Society&#x27;s (AMS) Seal of 
Approval and has contributed extensively to the AMS community. Her 
service includes roles on the Broadcast Board of the AMS, the AMS Board 
on Pre-College Education, and the AMS Minority Scholarship National 
Committee.
  Throughout her career, Ms. Amadeo has been recognized with numerous 
accolades. In 2012, she received the Martin Luther King Jr. Dream Award 
from the Albany King Day Committee, as well as the Women of Purpose 
Award. In 2010, the Georgia Association of Broadcasters honored her 
with an Honorable Mention for Best Weather Reporting. She is also a 
recipient of the 2007 National Mark Trail Award, recognizing her 
efforts to promote weather safety through the use of weather radios. 
That same year, I had the privilege of awarding her a Certificate of 
Special Congressional Recognition for her outstanding achievements, 
dedicated service, and public distinction. Furthermore, U.S. Senator 
Johnny Isakson acknowledged her important work educating the public on 
the life-saving role of NOAA Weather Radios during severe weather. In 
2004, Ms. Amadeo was celebrated as one of Southwest Georgia&#x27;s ``Steel 
Magnolias&#x27;&#x27; at the Women Making Magic Event.
  Perhaps most inspiring is her dedication to mentoring aspiring 
meteorologists. She cherishes the relationships she has built through 
sharing her expertise, providing guidance, and offering both 
motivational and emotional support. Yolanda is deeply committed to the 
success of those seeking career advice. Beyond her professional work, 
she actively shares her passion for meteorology with the community by 
educating students on the science of weather forecasting and promoting 
weather safety at civic and social events.
  Ms. Amadeo&#x27;s community involvement extends to her volunteerism with 
the Southwest Georgia Chapter of the American Red Cross, where she has 
served as both a volunteer and board member. She is also an active 
member of St. Teresa&#x27;s Catholic Church, serving as a lector and member 
of the Parish Council, and volunteers at St. Clare&#x27;s Soup Kitchen, 
helping those in need within our neighborhood.
  As former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm wisely said, ``Service is 
the rent we pay for the space we occupy here on this earth.&#x27;&#x27; In 
celebrating Ms. Amadeo&#x27;s 30 years as Chief Meteorologist, it is clear 
she has paid her rent and paid it well. Her unwavering commitment to 
informing and uplifting her community is truly commendable, and both 
Albany and the state of Georgia are stronger and safer because of her.
  Yolanda&#x27;s many accomplishments would not have been possible without 
the grace of God and the steadfast love and support of her family.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, 
along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia&#x27;s Second District, 
in recognizing and commending Ms. Yolanda Amadeo for 30 remarkable 
years as Chief Meteorologist at WALB-TV, and in wishing her many more 
years of success and service.

          HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM (BILL) THOMPSON BAGLEY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor William (Bill) T. 
Baglietto who passed away on June 9, 2025, at the age of 96, after a 
remarkable life of public service, legal distinction, and civic 
leadership.
  Born in San Francisco in 1928, Bill&#x27;s early years were shaped by 
hardship. After his family faced bankruptcy during the Great 
Depression, they relocated to a cabin in Woodacre, California. From 
these humble beginnings, Bill&#x27;s extraordinary work ethic and intellect 
carried him far. He worked his way through high school, college, and 
law school as a member of the Marin County Fire Department, ultimately 
graduating as valedictorian from the University of California, Berkeley 
in 1949. He earned his J.D. from Berkeley Law in 1952, where he served 
on the California Law Review--a foundation for what would become a 
distinguished legal career.
  Bill practiced law for 63 years, including 35 years as a partner at 
Nossaman LLP. He became one of California&#x27;s leading experts in 
business, water, transportation, and public policy law. Among his many 
legal contributions, he successfully defended First Amendment rights 
before the United States Supreme Court. His commitment to justice, 
transparency, and public accountability informed both his legal 
practice and his public service.
  From 1960 to 1974, Bill represented Marin and Sonoma Counties in the 
California State Assembly. A moderate Republican and tireless advocate 
for civil rights, he received an outstanding voter rating from the 
NAACP throughout his legislative career. Notably, he authored landmark 
legislation on transparency including the California Public Records Act 
and the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act--cornerstones of open government 
in California.
  Following his time in the Assembly, Bill was appointed by President 
Gerald Ford as the first chair of the newly created Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission. Under his leadership, the CFTC helped modernize and 
globalize the futures market. He traveled to Europe and Tokyo 
advocating for fair, well-regulated markets, and served on the Futures 
Industry Association Board of Directors. His public service extended to 
the California Transportation Commission, the Public Utilities 
Commission, and the University of California Board of Regents--each 
role reflecting his lifelong commitment to the public good.
  Bill received numerous accolades throughout his life, including the 
UC Berkeley Alumnus of the Year award in 2002. But to those who knew 
him well, he will be remembered for his character: principled, 
pragmatic, and endlessly generous with his time and wisdom.
  Bill is survived by his wife of 60 years, Diane; their children Lynn, 
Bill, Jr., Walter, Shana, and Tracy, and his grandchildren Nicholas, 
Julian, Nathaniel, Grant, and Layli.
  Mr. Speaker, Bill Bagley embodied a rare blend of intellect, 
humility, and commitment to public service. He believed government 
could work to improve quality of life for everyone--and he worked 
tirelessly to prove it. I respectfully ask that you join me in honoring 
his enduring legacy and extending our deepest condolences to his 
family, friends, and all who had the privilege to know him.

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;m honored to recognize Corporal (Cpl) 
George Ivanoff, United States Marine Corps (USMC), on the auspicious 
occasion of his 100th Birthday on July 24, 2025.
  Cpl Ivanoff, born in Harrisburg in 1925, left Harrisburg Catholic 
High School early to answer the call of duty to our Country by joining 
the USMC in 1943. He served with valor in the Pacific Theatre on the 
islands of Peleliu and Okinawa, where he was twice awarded the Purple 
Heart medal for wounds suffered in combat. On the occasion when his 
Corpsman was wounded, Cpl Ivanoff attempted nobly to evacuate him, but 
both were struck by enemy mortar fire that ultimately killed his 
Corpsman and forced his own medical evacuation.
  Once healed from his wounds, Cpl Ivanoff rejoined his unit in the 
pivotal battle of Okinawa, where he fought valiantly for 45 days. While 
advancing on the enemy position, incoming fire forced him to take cover 
in an artillery shell hole. Looking out to spot the enemy, he was shot 
through the face. Unconscious for a time, he woke to feel a gaping hole 
in his face. Confronted with the thought of imminent death, he prayed 
to the Lord for forgiveness, and lost consciousness--seemingly for the 
last time. To his surprise, he regained consciousness again. Spotting a 
couple fellow Marines taking cover behind rocks from the same sniper 
who had shot him, Cpl Ivanoff asked for a rifle, offering to risk his 
life to take the sniper out; but they forced him away.
  He was carried on a stretcher to the hospital tent where he fully 
expected to die. He was given Last Rites by the Company Chaplain and 
left by himself. Presumed dead by the doctors and nurses, he was not 
tended to. Eventually, one doctor said ``Hey, this guy is still 
alive!&#x27;&#x27; Miraculously, after his wounds were addressed and he was 
stabilized, he not only survived, but fully recovered.
  Cpl Ivanoff returned home a hero. He finished his education at 
Harrisburg Catholic High School and began his civilian career at the 
Post Office. He became an accomplished amateur golfer, earning the 1968 
Harrisburg Championship, and still golfs at 100 years young.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Citizens of the 10th Congressional 
District and a grateful Nation, I&#x27;m honored, humbled, and privileged to 
recognize United States Marine Corps Corporal George Ivanoff on his 
100th Birthday. I wish him continued great health, love, and happiness 
in his future adventures, and continued Godspeed. For his selfless, 
honorable, and tireless service to our great United States of America, 
``Thank You&#x27;&#x27; will never be enough. He is the standard by which we all 
should be judged.

  Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major Jennie Marie 
Fregoso for her outstanding 25 years of service in the United States 
Army. From May 2000 to July 2025, Major Fregoso exemplified the Army&#x27;s 
core values of duty, honor, and selfless service, leaving a lasting

leadership were pivotal during the transformation of the 349th Combat 
Support Hospital into the 349th Field Hospital and 380th Hospital 
Center, and she was personally commended for her performance as Battle 
Captain during CSTX.
  During her 2004 to 2005 deployment in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom, Major Fregoso served at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, 
took part in a humanitarian mission in El Salvador, and led a cost-
saving initiative that saved the Army over $600,000. She completed key 
leadership courses and earned multiple awards, including the Army 
Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Humanitarian 
Service Medal.
  Major Jennie Marie Fregoso&#x27;s service has strengthened the operational 
readiness of the Army Reserve medical community and shaped the careers 
of countless soldiers. Her legacy is one of dedication, leadership, and 
unwavering professionalism. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
her exceptional career and in wishing her continued success and 
fulfillment in retirement.

    RECOGNIZING MR. ETHAN ALBRIGHT FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENT IN LOCAL AND 
                       INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE FAIR

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize 
Mr. Ethan Albright of Hempfield High School for his achievement of 
third place in the `Material Science&#x27; category at the 2025 Regeneron 
International Science and Engineering Fair, a competition including 
1,700 students and representing over 60 countries.
  Mr. Albright, a rising senior at Hempfield High School in Lancaster 
County, was also the Division Champion at the 2025 North Museum Science 
and Engineering Fair. Mr. Albright is the first North Museum Science &amp; 
Engineering champion to win an award in international competition since 
2017.
  In both competitions, his project centered on experimenting with and 
designing fully biodegradable fishing lures as an eco-friendly, cost-
effective replacement for plastic lures. The worm-shaped lure, made 
from a biopolymer recipe, could substitute for traditional soft plastic 
lures which can break off hooks and sink to the bottom of waterways. 
Mr. Albright cites his early memories of swimming and fishing on the 
Susquehanna River with his father as the driving motivation for his 
desire to keep our community&#x27;s waterways clean and plastic-free.
  I want to congratulate Mr. Albright on his achievement at the local 
and international level, and to recognize the hard work, dedication, 
and innovative spirit that went into his project. As a fisherman 
myself, I am grateful for Mr. Albright&#x27;s contributions to solving the 
pollution issue. I wish him continued success in his studies and 
pursuits.

    RECOGNIZING MS. ABBY LACHMAN FOR HER DEDICATED MEDICAL RESEARCH 
                                ADVOCACY

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JANELLE S. BYNUM

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Ms. BYNUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding 
efforts made by one of my own constituents, Ms. Abby Lachman. Ms. 
Lachman, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 6, recently 
visited Washington, D.C. to advocate on behalf of herself and the 
millions of Americans living with Type 1. I am impressed by her 
dedication to advocating for herself and her peers at such a young age 
and I am eager to see the changes she will make in the future. I am 
proud to represent you here in Congress Abby. I include in the Record 
the following article written by Noemi Arellano-Summer in the Bend 
Bulletin highlighting Abby&#x27;s work.

       A Bend teenager who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 
     age 6 is going to Washington, D.C. to advocate for medical 
     research and affordable insulin. Abby Lachman is traveling to 
     D.C. Monday through 10 with Breakthrough T1D, an organization 
     that supports those with Type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is 
     a chronic autoimmune disease in which the body&#x27;s immune 
     system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, 
     so people with the disease must take insulin by injection or 
     insulin pump to survive Abby, 15, will be a sophomore at 
     Summit High in the fall. One of Abby&#x27;s mentors with 
     Breakthrough T1D encouraged her to apply to be part of the 
     Children&#x27;s Congress, an initiative the organization runs that 
     sends more than 160 kids with Type 1 diabetes to the capitol 
     every two years to advocate for research. She will be 
     speaking with a senator and representatives to share her 
     story.
       ``A lot of it, I think, is just to put a face to the number 
     or the story,&#x27;&#x27; she said. ``Because we want to help increase 
     funding or continue it, especially at a time when a lot of 
     medical research is getting cut. . . I&#x27;m looking forward to 
     all of it. Sometimes it feels surreal just thinking about it. 
     This is such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I feel so 
     blessed that I get to go and do this.&#x27;&#x27; Abby&#x27;s been part of 
     Zoom meetings with the team to talk through ideas for the 
     trip and has put together a scrapbook of her journey with 
     Type 1 diabetes, she said. She&#x27;s had to manage her disease 
     constantly for nearly a decade. ``For me, since I&#x27;ve had it 
     for so long, it&#x27;s pretty much my life, so I&#x27;m a lot more used 
     to it. I have two devices, which are really helpful,&#x27;&#x27; she 
     said. ``It&#x27;s pretty much just constant regulation. It&#x27;s like, 
     where&#x27;s my number at? Do I need to give a little insulin to 
     help it bring down? Do I need to eat something to come up? 
     It&#x27;s just constantly doing little things, checking it, making 
     sure you&#x27;re where you need to be.&#x27;&#x27;
       When she was first diagnosed, Abby had to give herself 
     injections, and didn&#x27;t have the insulin pump, phone app and 
     other devices she has now to help her monitor her blood 
     sugar. ``I didn&#x27;t have the easiest time with it, so if I get 
     the chance to maybe help other kids not have that, it&#x27;s 
     really important to me,&#x27;&#x27; she said. ``I think that&#x27;s a big 
     part of what keeps me involved with this stuff.&#x27;&#x27; Last 
     summer, Abby helped out at Camp Tamarack, during a week that 
     is dedicated to kids with Type 1 diabetes. In the future, she 
     said she wants to travel and see the world.
       Though there are two types of diabetes, they are fairly 
     different, and Abby thinks that&#x27;s part of the reason why Type 
     1 diabetics have a hard time being diagnosed. ``(Type 1 
     diabetes) is definitely a hard disease to see, and it is 
     common. A lot of people have it, which is why it&#x27;s so weird 
     that it&#x27;s almost unheard of at times,&#x27;&#x27; she said. ``Diagnosis 
     is not easy for a lot of kids. My time with diagnosis was 
     easy. My mom&#x27;s a doctor, so we caught it super easy, which 
     was very lucky. Kids that don&#x27;t have that same chance--I knew 
     a kid who didn&#x27;t know, his parents had no idea it could be a 
     possibility and he got super sick. When he woke up in the 
     morning, he had to get evac&#x27;d out and had brain damage. He 
     had to learn how to walk again. It&#x27;s just so hard. It really 
     needs both that work towards a cure and showing that this is 
     something out there that people struggle with.&#x27;&#x27;

                       SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS

  Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February

Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place and 
purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or 
changes in the meetings as they occur.
  As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this

Congressional Record on Monday and Wednesday of each week.
  Meetings scheduled for Tuesday, July 15, 2025 may be found in the

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF COLDWATER HIGH SCHOOL&#x27;S GIRLS 4X400 METER RELAY 
     TEAM FOR WINNING THE DIVISION III STATE TRACK AND FIELD TITLE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT E. LATTA

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 14, 2025

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise 
to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school track and 
field relay team in Ohio&#x27;s Fifth Congressional District. The young 
women of the Coldwater High School&#x27;s Girls 4x400 Meter Relay team have 
represented their school ably on their way to achieving the Division 
III State Track and Field Title. The team overcame the challenges posed 
by intense competition in their effort to surpass all other relay teams 
in their event.
  In pursuing the State Championship, Audrey Alig, Lana Kaiser, 
Kiersten Keller, and Isabella Zahn defeated their outstanding 
competitors to win with an impressive time of 3:53.94. The members of 
this very special team have shown that their sport requires an 
individual effort for a team result. Their hard work and dedication, 
both on and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment should be 
commended.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Coldwater 
High School Girls 4x400 Meter Relay team. On behalf of the people of 
the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great 
achievement.

                          ____________________

  Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Mr. 
Richard Messbarger for his 32 years of invaluable service to the 
Greater Kingsville Economic Development Council (EDC).
  Mr. Messbarger has displayed true dedication to his community. As an 
exemplary Texan. Mr. Messbarger received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 
English Language and Literature from St. Mary&#x27;s University and master&#x27;s 
degree from Texas A&amp;I University Kingsville. Since then, he has 
dedicated his life to public service and ensuring the development of 
our community.
  A veteran of the United States Navy, he became the 38th recipient of 
Naval Aviation Honorary Wings of Gold for his contribution to his 
community. As the founder and key member of the Naval Air Station (NAS) 
Kingsville Task Force, his commitment to his community has alleviated 
many concerns which made NAS Kingsville vulnerable to Base closures. 
His exemplary efforts have ensured that our military community in 
Kingsville is up to the highest standards of excellence. Mr. Messbarger 
is also the former president of the Kingsville Chapter of Navy League 
and the former Navy League National Director.
  Mr. Messbarger is a proud recipient of the Sam Walton Business Leader 
Award. His exemplary work was further recognized when he received the 
Kingsville Citizen of the Year award in 2008. In 2013, he was the 
recipient of the Otis West Lifetime Service Award by the Kingsville 
Chamber of Commerce.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Mr. Messbarger for his dedication, 
passion, service to our country and his many years of public service.
