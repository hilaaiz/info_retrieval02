 CELEBRATING 35 YEARS OF THE LOCAL INITIATIVES SUPPORT CORPORATION OF 
                                HOUSTON

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an 
organization that has spent 35 years building a legacy of hope, 
resilience, and sustainable communities across the Houston area--the 
Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) Houston. Since 1989, LISC 
Houston has been more than a community builder; it&#x27;s been a lifeline to 
countless families and neighborhoods, investing over $592 million and 
leveraging $1.5 billion to bring more than 11,000 affordable homes and 
over two million square feet of community spaces to life.
  Think about that for a moment. Over three decades of building homes 
and hope--three decades of investing in people, families, and 
neighborhoods that are the bedrock of this great city. LISC Houston is 
grounded in the belief that everyone deserves a roof over their head 
and a vibrant community, a place where they can work, raise their 
children, and feel a sense of belonging.
  Through its Financial Opportunity Centers and partnerships with local 
businesses,

[[Page E1108]]

LISC has helped thousands in our area find good-paying jobs, start 
businesses, and build brighter futures. When it comes to affordable 
housing, they haven&#x27;t just built homes; they&#x27;ve built foundations--
places where families feel rooted, children feel safe, and communities 
can grow and thrive. LISC stands alone in the Houston region as the 
organization that tackles every facet of affordable housing--from 
providing training and developing new housing to preserving existing 
homes, expanding access to homeownership, and leading post-disaster 
recovery efforts.
  And LISC Houston&#x27;s work is far from finished. As they look to the 
future, they&#x27;re setting their sights on new challenges--focusing on 
digital literacy, place-based development, economic mobility, and 
climate resilience. They&#x27;re supporting small businesses, including 
childcare providers, and empowering emerging housing developers. 
They&#x27;re creating pathways to homeownership, lifting up families, and 
transforming communities with every project.
  Mr. Speaker, LISC Houston&#x27;s legacy reminds us that when we come 
together, we can build something lasting. It&#x27;s a vision that speaks to 
the best of who we are--a belief in the power of community, in lifting 
each other up, and in making sure that everyone has a fair shot at a 
better future.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating LISC&#x27;s important 
milestone and their tremendous impact.

   CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LOAVES &amp; FISHES COMMUNITY 
                                SERVICES

                                 ______

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40th 
Anniversary of Loaves &amp; Fishes Community Services, one of the largest 
food pantries in Illinois. Founded in 1984 by a group of compassionate 
members of St. Raphael Catholic Church, this organization began as a 
small food pantry in a church closet, serving just eight families. 
Today, 40 years later, Loaves &amp; Fishes provides assistance to over 
10,000 individuals each week, including residents of DuPage, Kane, 
Kendall, and Will Counties.
  The success of Loaves &amp; Fishes can be attributed to the collaboration 
of its dedicated staff and more than 1,000 volunteers, who range from 
teenagers to seniors nearing 90 years old. Their commitment has been 
instrumental in ensuring the prosperity of countless families. The 
extensive volunteer hours contributed over the years have allowed 
Loaves &amp; Fishes to scale its operations, enabling efficient and cost-
effective service at facilities such as the Frank J. Rus &amp; Donald S. 
Toy Food Market &amp; Resource Center.
  Over the years, Loaves &amp; Fishes has expanded its mission beyond 
addressing food insecurity to include programs that promote self-
sufficiency. These initiatives include offering emergency assistance 
for rent and utilities, help with public benefits, vehicle donations, 
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA), employment readiness support, 
and the Moving Up program--a 20-session intensive course designed to 
help clients identify and overcome barriers to progress.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have Loaves &amp; Fishes Community Services in 
my district, actively working to alleviate hunger and support our 
community. I invite my colleagues to join me in expressing gratitude to 
Mike Havala, the current President and CEO of Loaves &amp; Fishes, along 
with all the dedicated members of this organization. May it continue to 
be a beacon of service for many years to come.

                          ____________________

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Central American 
Resource Center (CARECEN) Established in the District of Columbia as 
the Central American Refugee Center, CARECEN is celebrating its 43rd 
anniversary this month.
  CARECEN was founded in 1981 to provide legal assistance to Central 
American refugees. Today, in addition to providing such assistance, 
CARECEN provides several services to D.C.&#x27;s Latino community, including 
citizenship classes, tenant organizing and legal services. CARECEN also 
advocates for refugees and immigrants from Central America on the 
federal level. Since the 1990s, CARECEN has advocated for granting 
Temporary Protected Status for nationals from Latin American countries.
  I ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing CARECEN 
for its contributions to D.C. and D.C.&#x27;s Latino community over the last 
43 years.

 CONGRATULATING SISTER JUDITH ANN ON 18 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE THIRD 
                ORDER OF ST. FRANCIS AND OSF HEALTHCARE

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Sister Judith Ann 
Duvall for her 18 years of honorable service as the major superior of 
the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis and as Chairperson of the 
OSF Healthcare system in Illinois.
  Sister Judith Ann was born just outside of St. Louis, Missouri as the 
middle child in a modest Catholic family. She entered the convent in 
September of 1964 and then went on to receive her Bachelor of Science 
in Nursing from Northern Illinois University, a master&#x27;s degree in 
Catholic doctrine from St. John&#x27;s University in New York City; and a 
Bachelor of Science in Business Management and Administration from 
Bradley University. Since entering the convent, Sister Judith Ann has 
devoted her life to her vocation and the advancement of the mission of 
OSF.
  During her time with OSF, Sister Judith Ann worked tirelessly in 
support of improving the healthcare system in Illinois. Under Sister 
Judith Ann&#x27;s leadership, OSF experienced dramatic growth. The OSF 
Healthcare system grew from 6 hospitals to 16 hospitals across the 
state and has expanded its employment level from 13,000 to 25,000 
employees.
  In 2013, she helped Peoria welcome the OSF Richard L. Owens Hospice 
Home which provides individuals facing chronic illness with 
compassionate and merciful caregivers during their journey to eternal 
life. Additionally, Sister Judith Ann worked to build a strong 
relationship between the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Illinois and Easter 
Seals. This partnership and collaboration, stemming from Sister Judith 
Ann&#x27;s work, has inspired innovation for children&#x27;s healthcare across 
Central Illinois.
  In recognition of her dedication to Catholic healthcare and 
leadership, Pope Benedict XVI granted Sister Judith Ann the Pro 
Ecclesia et Pontifice Cross in October of 2012. Additionally, Sister 
Judith Ann&#x27;s incredible service and leadership to the Peoria area, 
through OSF Healthcare, earned her the Pere Marquette Award and the 
Edythe A. Cohen Business and Industry Award.
  Sister Judith Ann&#x27;s tireless work has greatly impacted the Peoria 
community and the state of Illinois. Her commitment to her vocation and 
service to others is truly inspiring. Congratulations to Sister Judith 
Ann on 18 years of service to the Third Order of St. Francis and to OSF 
Healthcare. We are grateful for her dedication to our community.

  Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Los Angeles Dodgers for 
bringing home their eighth World Series title. I am especially proud of 
first baseman Freddie Freeman, a California-45 native from Fountain 
Valley, for representing Orange County so well on the national stage

  Freddie has shown remarkable perseverance in overcoming personal and 
professional trials, and this tremendous accomplishment is a testament 
to his work ethic and drive to succeed.

excelled at the highest level and added to the rich baseball tradition

and can not wait to see more championships in the years to come.

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Officer Graciela 
Santillano James for her service and dedication to the community&#x27;s 
safety and prosperity.
  Graciela graduated from Dos Palos High School in 1992 and earned her 
bachelor of arts degree from Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California in 
1996. She began her lifelong career after completing the California 
Highway Patrol Academy in September 2003. Initially serving in the San 
Jose area, she later transferred to Fresno. Her skills and teamwork 
were recognized, leading to her promotion to the Central Division 
Traffic Management Center in April 2009.
  She quickly established herself as a respected member of our valley 
through her unwavering dedication and eagerness to grow. In May 2012, 
she was chosen for the Central Division El Protector Community Outreach 
Program, where she engages with the Hispanic community to share 
information about local events, such as townhall meetings, and to 
foster trust in law enforcement. She takes great pride in this 
initiative, describing it as a ``service to California.&#x27;&#x27;
  As a young girl, Graciela aspired to become a California Highway 
Patrol Officer. She remembers her parents consistently stressing the 
importance of education, and she was inspired by watching Spanish 
television with her father. From an early age, she resolutely decided 
that she wanted to be the ``El Protector&#x27;&#x27; of her community.
  Her service extends beyond her job as she has demonstrated her 
involvement with numerous organizations such as El Concilio de Fresno--
Cesar Chavez Concilio, who has built fundamental relationships for her 
programs, Mexican Consulate of both Fresno and Atlanta, Proteus, Inc., 
the Latino Rotary--Fresno, Holy Cross Center for Women, U.S. Department 
of Homeland Security--U.S. Citizenship and Immigration and numerous 
schools in both Madera and Fresno Counties.
  Officer Santillano James has been recognized for her extensive 
accomplishments among which include holding office as vice-president 
and scholarship coordinator for the Latino Peace Officers Association--
Fresno Chapter, where she is committed to their mission of ``honoring 
family, education, and community through service and mentorship.&#x27;&#x27; 
Additionally, she was appointed vice-chair for Centro La Familia 
Advocacy Services and recognized as an Outstanding Board Member for her 
commitment.
  Today, we bid farewell and thank Officer Graciela for her service and 
going above and beyond for her community. Despite her career coming to 
an end, she continues to represent the Hispanic community as a 
bilingual and bicultural officer and aims to motivate individuals. As 
we honor the career of Officer Graciela Santillano James, I commend her 
for her advocacy and leadership.
  Mr Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring 
the career of Officer Graciela Santillano James. Let us celebrate her 
diligence and devotion to the safety of others and educating her 
community.

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a 
distinguished marine, successful businessman, philanthropist, and 
cherished family man, Gary Lee Bruno. Born on August 11, 1946, in 
Morgantown, West Virginia, Gary&#x27;s life unfolded as an inspiring 
tapestry of service, resilience, and unwavering commitment.
  At the age of 8, Gary and his family planted roots in Fresno, 
California, where he navigated the vibrant complexities of a large 
Italian family as the middle child of five boys. His academic journey, 
led him to Central High School and later to Fresno State University, 
where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in political science. 
Concurrently, Gary embraced a profound sense of duty, joining the 
Marine Corps while in college, earning his commission as an officer in 
July 1966.
  Gary&#x27;s steadfast commitment to service saw him proudly serving as a 
U.S. marine for nearly four years, including a tour in Vietnam as an 
artillery officer. His valor and dedication earned him accolades such 
as the Navy Commendation Medal (V for Valor), Combat Action Ribbon, and 
numerous other commendations. Retiring from the Marine Corps Reserve as 
a lieutenant colonel in 1986, Gary carried the pride of his military 
service throughout his life. While in the reserves, Gary served as the 
Headquarters and Support Commanding Officer and was well respected by 
fellow marines for his honorable leadership.
  Returning to Fresno in 1972 with his wife and baby daughter, Cynthia, 
Gary, as a father, reveled in coaching his daughters&#x27; cross-country 
teams, participating in family activities, and instilling a love for 
adventure and shared experiences. In 1978, he founded G.L. Bruno 
Associates, Inc., focusing on real estate development and medical 
facility construction, making significant contributions to healthcare 
accessibility in the Central Valley.
  Beyond his business endeavors, Gary was driven by a core belief in 
giving back. In 1996, he established the G.L. Bruno Family Foundation, 
channeling over $2 million to support socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals, with a particular emphasis on matters 
concerning women and children.
  Gary lived life with fervor, finding joy in flying his airplane, 
playing golf, and savoring a good martini. His dignified demeanor, 
witty jokes, and a ready handkerchief became hallmarks of his presence. 
Even in the face of a courageous battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, 
Gary&#x27;s sense of humor endured.
  Gary leaves behind a legacy of passion and generosity. Survived by 
his daughters, Cynthia Bruno Rafferty and Aimee Bogna, their families, 
and loyal dog Bailey, Gary&#x27;s impact extends to his ex-wives, brothers, 
nieces, nephews, and cherished friends. In commemorating Gary Lee 
Bruno, we honor a life that blended duty, enterprise, and compassion--a 
life that will forever inspire those who knew him.
  Mr. Speaker, I extend my heartfelt condolences to his family and 
invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the 
memory of Gary Lee Bruno.

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
honor the life of Amir Abdur-Rahim who Inspired students and our Tampa 
Bay community with his sincerity, generosity and passion. As the 
vibrant Head Coach for the University of South Florida Men&#x27;s Basketball 
team, Coach Abdul-Rahim set high moral standards for all and displayed 
an uncommon commitment to students, players and the entire USF Family.
  Amir Abdur-Rahim grew up in Marietta, Georgia, and held his first 
head coach position at Kennesaw State University from 2019 before 
joining the Bulls family in 2023. Coach

[[Page E1107]]

Abdur-Rahim was credited with turning KSU&#x27;s program into a record-
breaking success. But it is not his incredible professional 
accomplishments that made him the great man he was. He was a servant 
leader with genuine care for those around him. He transformed not only 
records but also the hearts and minds of entire communities.
  Coach Abdur-Rahim was immediately embraced by the USF family. When 
USF Vice President for Athletics Michael Kelly described Coach&#x27;s impact 
on the team and university, Kelly said, ``he connected this whole 
community.`` Around campus, Coach was known for picking up students&#x27; 
coffee tabs, personally greeting camped-out fans in front of the 
Yuengling Center, and dancing with the school band after home game 
wins. His spirit and joy were felt by the entire student body.
  To his players, he was so much more. At the press conference 
following the team&#x27;s historic first regular season conference 
championship, Coach Abdur-Rahim said, ``It&#x27;s just great to see growth 
in young people, man, when they start to see themselves as more than 
just basketball players, when they start to see themselves as men.&#x27;&#x27;
  Following last year&#x27;s historic season, Coach was unanimously voted 
American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. Yet, he felt an 
individual accolade was unfitting. Coach changed the trophy engraving 
from ``Coach of the Year&#x27;&#x27; to ``Staff of the Year.&#x27;&#x27; In all he did, 
Coach Abdur-Rahim found a way to serve those around him.
  Above all else, Coach Abdur-Rahim loved his family. He is survived by 
his wife, Arianne, and their three children, Laila, Lana and Aydin. His 
legacy will live on through his family and all who had the privilege of 
sharing time with him on the basketball court.
  Coach Abdur-Rahim used to say: ``No record is going to tell you what 
impact you have on people around you.&#x27;&#x27; The impact Coach had on the USF 
community is immeasurable, and his optimism, devotion and servant 
leadership will continue to inspire us all.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my neighbors across Tampa Bay, I sincerely 
thank Amir Abdur-Rahim for the joy and life he infused into our 
community. We are all eternally grateful.

            HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF CLEMENTINE PUGH

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the life, 
legacy, and work of Clementine Pugh, a dear and distinguished friend of 
my predecessor, The Honorable Charles B. Rangel. As a strong believer 
in the power of knowledge, she demonstrated the importance of learning 
and expanding educational opportunities for women and African Americans 
throughout our great Nation.
  On June 20, 2015, at Harlem&#x27;s historic Riverside Church, family and 
community gathered to memorialize Clementine&#x27;s life and contributions 
to opening our minds to the importance of culture, honesty, and 
knowledge. On April 11, 1925, Clementine was born to Alberta and Otho 
High in Raleigh, North Carolina. She attended Shaw University, where 
she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. She began her career as a 
psychiatric social worker, moving on to becoming a public school 
teacher and, eventually, a professor at Hunter and Lehman Colleges of 
the City University of New York.
  After 20 years of service at Lehman College, she was awarded the 
title of Professor Emeritus of Education. She earned a Master of Social 
Work degree in 1949 from New York&#x27;s Columbia University and a Doctorate 
in Education from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1982. 
For her teachings, she was awarded the prestigious title of Professor 
Emeritus of Education.
  Clementine vividly strived for honesty and understanding. She made it 
her duty to present others with the awareness she obtained. Her 
tireless effort to engage, enjoy, and educate people touched the hearts 
of every person she met. A woman ahead of her time, Clementine Pugh 
tackled the many realms of ``isms&#x27;&#x27; including racism, sexism and 
classism. Her life was devoted to acknowledging and improving how these 
systems affect African American people. With her remarkable resilience, 
my predecessor, The Honorable Charles B. Rangel, is proud to have 
called Clementine and her husband, G. Douglas Pugh, dear and very 
special friends.
  I know that Clementine&#x27;s legacy will live on for many years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me as 
we pay tribute to such a treasure to our community. I pledge to 
continue to carry out her tradition of provoking thought and feeling 
for all who have lost their way or simply need to be reminded of who we 
are, what we come from, and how we can overcome any obstacle.

               IN PRAISE OF THE IDF&#x27;S TRIUMPH OVER TERROR

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RITCHIE TORRES

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the majority of 
Americans who feel as I do, I commend the Isreali Defense Forces (IDF) 
for ridding the world of one of its most wretched war criminals, Yahya 
Sinwar.
  As the mastermind of October 7th, the deadliest day for Jews since 
the Holocaust, Sinwar orchestrated the murder, maiming, mutilation, 
rape, torture, and abduction of Israelis as well as Americans. The 
IDF&#x27;s triumph over Sinwar&#x27;s reign of terror sends a resounding message 
to the rest of the world. The fate of the Middle East no longer belongs 
to the antisemitic wars of the past. It belongs to the Abrahamic peace 
of the future, a peace forged in the crucible of Israel&#x27;s formidable 
fighting force.
  The heroes of the IDF have shown Israel to be one of the few liberal 
democracies willing to fight for liberal democracy and one of the few 
Western nations willing to fight for Western civilization. May God 
Bless the IDF. Am Yisrael Chai (The People of Israel Live).

RECOGNIZING PA-1&#x27;s HOMETOWN HERO: MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP POLICE DEPARTMENT 
                       LIEUTENANT KENNETH MELLUS

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, November 1, 2024

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
extraordinary individual from Pennsylvania&#x27;s First Congressional 
District--someone who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in 
service to both our community and our country. It is with great respect 
and admiration that I recognize Lt. Kenneth Mellus, one of our 
district&#x27;s distinguished Hometown Heroes.
  Hometown Heroes are not defined by titles of accolades but by the 
quiet power of their actions. They are distinguished by their 
unwavering integrity, the strength of their character, and their 
steadfast commitment to the people and places they serve. They are the 
foundation upon which our communities stand--the ones who lift others 
up, inspire hope, and, in doing so, call us all to higher standards of 
service and compassion. Lt. Mellus has embodied this spirit in ways 
that words can scarcely capture.
  For the past thirty-eight years, Lt. Mellus has tirelessly served and 
protected our community here in Bucks County. Lt. Mellus began his 
career with the Middletown Township Police Department in 1985, first as 
a patrol officer before serving eight years as a K-9 handler alongside 
his faithful partner, K-9 Snowball. Following his promotion to Sergeant 
in 1995, he was instrumental in the development and implementation of 
several outstanding and successful community policing initiatives, 
including the Citizens Police Academy, Neshaminy School District&#x27;s 
Adopt-a-Cop program, child fingerprinting/ID programs, K-9 
demonstrations, and a series of Crime Prevention seminars. In 2011, he 
was promoted to Lieutenant and continued to be a driving force of 
innovation and positive change within the department. His efforts and 
contributions towards enhancing and improving the department&#x27;s IT 
infrastructure resulted in nearly all the technology MTPD utilizes 
today. From dash cameras and departmental training to a records 
management and scheduling system, Lt. Mellus&#x27;s vision and leadership 
were pivotal in revolutionizing the department&#x27;s technological 
landscape and ensuring MTPD had the necessary tools to serve and 
protect our community.
  Mr. Speaker, it is through the work of people like Lt. Mellus that 
our communities thrive, and our Nation grows stronger. His actions 
remind us that progress is not forged in grand

[[Page E1110]]

gestures, but in the cumulative power of selfless acts. He embodies the 
timeless American values of resilience, generosity, and compassion, 
showing us that the future is built by those who care deeply, act 
decisively, and give without hesitation.
  On behalf of Pennsylvania&#x27;s First Congressional District, I extend my 
deepest gratitude to Lt. Mellus for his extraordinary service. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional individual, whose 
leadership and spirit of service will inspire generations to come. May 
his example remind us of the boundless potential within each of us to 
make our communities, country, and world a better place.

that words can scarcely capture.
  In his role as Plumstead Township Police Chief, David Mettin has not 
only served our community but transformed the lives of those around 
him. Throughout his remarkable 37-year career, his efforts and 
contributions have played a pivotal role in safeguarding our community 
and nurturing the next generation of law enforcement professionals, in 
which he instills a commitment to upholding excellence. Constituents 
like Chief Mettin strengthen the fabric of our district and prove that 
when driven by purpose, compassion, and a resolute sense of duty, one 
individual can leave a lasting and profound impact on an entire 
community.
  In times of uncertainty, it is the work of individuals like Chief 
Mettin that reminds us of the strength of the human spirit. Their 
service, given without expectation of recognition, stands as a 
testament to the belief that one individual&#x27;s dedication can ripple 
through the lives of many, sparking change, fostering resilience, and 
inspiring hope. Today, we honor

[[Page E1109]]

Chief Mettin not just for their remarkable deeds, but for who he is--a 
true hero, in every sense of the word.
  Mr. Speaker, it is through the work of people like Chief Mettin that 
our communities thrive, and our Nation grows stronger. His actions 
remind us that progress is not forged in grand gestures, but in the
