                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 3, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gurudev 
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a globally revered spiritual and humanitarian 
leader who has spearheaded an unprecedented worldwide movement for a 
stress-free, violence-free society. Through his organizations, 
including the Art of Living and the International Association for Human 
Values, Gurudev Shankar has impacted an estimated 800 million people 
across 180 countries. His programs have empowered individuals to tackle 
challenges at the global, national, community, and individual levels.
  Gurudev Shankar was born in 1956 in Southern India, where he 
demonstrated his spiritual and intellectual gifts at an early age. By 
the age of four, Gurudev Shankar was reciting the Bhagavad Gita and 
meditating. In 1982, during a ten-day period of silence, Gurudev 
Shankar developed Sudarshan Kriya, a powerful breathing technique that 
became central to the Art of Living courses, offering stress relief and 
well-being to millions.
  Gurudev Shankar founded The Art of Living as an international non-
profit organization dedicated to fostering peace and human values. He 
also established the International Association for Human Values to 
support sustainable development and conflict resolution worldwide. His 
programs have made significant impacts in conflict zones such as 
Kashmir, Colombia, and Iraq, and have provided trauma relief for war 
veterans and communities affected by violence.
  In addition to his global peace efforts, Gurudev Shankar is committed 
to education and environmental conservation. His initiatives have led 
to the creation of over 1,300 schools providing free education to 
underserved children in India, and his organization has planted over 
100 million trees across the globe. Furthermore, The Art of Living&#x27;s 
prison program has reached over 800,000 prisoners, helping to 
rehabilitate and reintegrate them into society.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar 
as he visits Western New York to lead &#x27;&#x27;The Journey Within,&#x27;&#x27; an 
evening of meditation and wisdom offering a unique opportunity for 
attendees to experience his transformative teachings firsthand. His 
lifelong commitment to peace, education, and humanitarian work 
continues to inspire millions worldwide, and we are all the better for 
it.

                        Thursday, April 3, 2025

  Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
remarkable leadership and service of Pastor Kenneth Simmons as we honor 
his 12th Pastoral Anniversary at Cold Spring Bible Chapel. Pastor 
Simmons&#x27; influence extends far beyond the walls of the church, making a 
lasting impact on the lives of those in need. Along with First Lady 
Jamelle Simmons, Pastor Simmons has touched the hearts of countless 
individuals throughout our community. His work has inspired many to 
pursue positive change, creating a ripple effect of compassion and 
support that continues to shape the future of Western New York.
  For over two decades, Pastor Simmons has dedicated his life to 
mentoring youth, aiding returning citizens in their re-entry to 
society, and supporting local organizations. He has worked tirelessly 
with little league sports organizations, block clubs, and street 
outreach programs, bringing hope and opportunity to countless families. 
One of his most notable contributions has been his work with the Youth 
Detention Center, where his efforts have transformed the facility, 
earning recognition from the State Office of Child and Family Services 
for turning it into a model for the entire state.
  Pastor Simmons has also made it a priority to reach out to the less 
fortunate in our community, providing critical support for those who 
need it most. For over a decade, he and his congregation have blessed 
thousands of youth with school supplies and book bags, ensuring they 
have the resources needed to succeed in their education. His dedication 
to helping the youth in our community, especially in the 14208 area and 
along Jefferson Avenue, has changed lives and inspired many to follow 
in his footsteps.
  It is an honor to recognize Pastor Kenneth Simmons for his unwavering 
commitment to serving our community and exemplifying the power of 
faith, service, and love. Pastor Simmons&#x27; work continues to uplift 
those around him, and I am proud to stand with him in celebrating this 
incredible milestone. I thank him for all that he has done, and may God 
continue to bless him and his ministry.

      CELEBRATING THE 160TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOWIE STATE UNIVERSITY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 3, 2025

  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a terrific institution 
that I am proud to represent in Maryland&#x27;s Fifth District: Bowie State 
University. On January 9, 2025. the school marked its 160th 
anniversary. The school will celebrate that historic milestone with a 
gala later this month.
  The oldest historically Black university in Maryland, Bowie State 
University (BSU) has been a beacon of opportunity, innovation, and 
academic excellence in our state and country ever since it was founded 
as the Baltimore Normal School for Colored Teachers in 1865. Many of 
its first students were recently emancipated Marylanders. The school 
offered Black Americans a pathway to educational--and economic--
advancement at a time when they were largely barred from such 
opportunities.
  Back in 1865, the school had only a few small rooms and a handful of 
students. Today, BSU boasts a 339-acre campus and over 6,350 
undergraduate and graduate students. It offers more than 65 bachelor&#x27;s, 
master&#x27;s, doctoral, and certificate programs. From quantum computing 
and artificial intelligence to biotech and pharmaceutical development, 
BSU students are producing cutting-edge research in the fields that 
will define the global 21st-century economy. Indeed, just this year, 
BSU received the distinguished 2025 Carnegie Research Activity 
Classification in recognition of its trailblazing research.
  Mr. Speaker, I&#x27;ve worked with many BSU students, faculty, and staff 
over the decades, and I can personally attest to how impressive they 
are. They are leaders not only in their fields but also in our 
community.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on this 
milestone. I have no doubt that BSU&#x27;s next 160 years will be just as 
successful as its first 160 years.

                        Thursday, April 3, 2025

  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate my constituent, 
Escondido resident, the secret soldier of the Korean War, and America&#x27;s 
true Top Gun hero. I&#x27;m talking about the one and only Captain Royce 
Williams, who turns 100 tomorrow, on April 4th.
  It is difficult to describe what Royce did for more than 30 harrowing 
minutes more than 70 years ago in the skies over the North Pacific and 
the coast of North Korea.
  On that day in 1952, Capt. Williams faced seven Soviet MiG-15s. 
Alone. Royce shot down four. Alone.
  He survived dozens of bullet holes to his plane, and a 37-millimeter 
round to his fuselage. Six inches to the right or left would have meant 
certain death.
  This was indomitable courage and the demonstration of the highest 
skill under incalculable duress. And it was kept secret for 40 years.
  We won&#x27;t stop until Royce Williams receives the recognition he 
doesn&#x27;t seek but richly deserves.
  I wish a Happy Birthday to Royce. Next stop: The Congressional Medal 
of Honor.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 3, 2025

  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rabbi 
David Steinhardt, a distinguished spiritual leader and educator, as he 
prepares to retire after more than three decades of dedicated service 
to B&#x27;nai Torah Congregation in Boca Raton, Florida. Rabbi Steinhardt&#x27;s 
journey to the rabbinate was shaped by his early experiences as the 
child of refugees from Nazi Germany and his deep connection to the 
Conservative Jewish movement, cultivated at Camp Ramah and Congregation 
Rodeph Sholom in Connecticut.
  Ordained in 1982 at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, 
Rabbi Steinhardt began his rabbinical career in Ohio before joining 
B&#x27;nai Torah in 1994, where he has since become a transformative figure. 
His proudest accomplishments include revitalizing the synagogue&#x27;s 
religious after-school program, which saw attendance soar from under 40 
percent to over 85 percent, and overseeing over 1,000 bar and bat 
mitzvahs. His congregants noted that in his congregation of 1,300 
families, Rabbi Steinhardt has made it a point to connect deeply with 
them, even knowing them all by name. Under his leadership, the 
synagogue grew significantly, expanding both its staff and its reach in 
the Boca Raton community.
  Rabbi Steinhardt&#x27;s commitment to Jewish education and community 
service has left a lasting legacy. As he transitions to ``rabbi 
emeritus,&#x27;&#x27; he will continue to contribute to his congregation and 
community, while embracing a busy retirement filled with teaching, 
writing, meditation, and time spent with his family.
  It is a privilege to recognize Rabbi Steinhardt today, and I wish him 
a fulfilling and rewarding retirement, and continued success.

                        Thursday, April 3, 2025

  Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Phyllis B. 
Fulton, who sadly passed away last week.
  A native of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Phyllis dedicated her 
life to serving her community through her work as a social worker. 
After graduating from North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State 
University in 1969, she began her career with the Wayne County 
Department of Social Services. While accompanying her husband on his 
assignments as a U.S. Air Force officer, Phyllis continued her work as 
a social worker around the world, helping foster kids, victims of child 
abuse, and families with adoption.
  After returning to North Carolina, Phyllis first worked at the Wake 
County Department of Social Services before moving to the North 
Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, where she was 
promoted to Program Coordinator of Community Child Protection Teams 
across the state. In this role, she traveled to all 100 of our state&#x27;s 
counties.
  In 2013, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory awarded Phyllis with The 
Order of the Long Leaf Pine, North Carolina&#x27;s highest honor--an 
accolade acknowledging her exemplary service to our state. She was 
recognized for her contributions to making North Carolina a better 
place for all of our people over the course of her more than 50-year 
career in social work.
  Phyllis was a beloved wife, mother, sister, grandmother, and friend. 
She embodied the true meaning of public service and made a lasting 
impact on her community and state. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the inspiring life and service of Phyllis Fulton.

school transfer student in 1978 as the Iranian Revolution was unfolding 
in her home country, graduating from North Carolina State University 
with degrees in Civil &amp; Agricultural Engineering. Sepi embraced 
opportunity, leaving a position at the North Carolina Department of 
Transportation in 2001 to found SEPI Engineering and Construction with 
a home equity loan, three employees, and two contracts. Within two 
decades, she grew SEPI Engineering and Construction to employ 300 
workers and $40 million in revenue, becoming one of the top 500 private 
engineering firms in the country.
  Sepi was well-known as an energetic, innovative leader in the 
Triangle, Beyond the success of SEPI Engineering and Construction, she 
held leadership positions at several important nonprofits and 
government organizations. Her wisdom and insights were valued at the 
Raleigh-Durham Airport Authority and the North Carolina Chamber of 
Commerce, earning her recognition as a Top Entrepreneur, Career Woman 
of the Year, and Top CEO. She was inducted into the North Carolina 
Business Hall of Fame in 2016 and the North Carolina Women Business 
Owners Hall of Fame in 2022.
  However, more than any of these prestigious accolades, Sepi will be 
remembered for living life with intention and compassion. She always 
took the time to learn everything she could about her employees and was 
a conscientious friend and mentor to many who aspired to follow in her 
footsteps. She was also a fierce advocate for women&#x27;s equality in the 
workplace and in society. She credited her mother and grandmother for 
encouraging her and her sister to pursue an education and pursue 
careers they could be passionate about.
  I have known Sepi for more than 20 years, both personally and 
professionally. We collaborated on transportation, immigration, and 
women&#x27;s issues. Together, we tried our best to make North Carolina a 
more prosperous and welcoming place. I will miss her as a dear friend 
and as an inspiring leader. Her son, Bardia, has been a valuable and 
trusted member of my team since I first ran for Congress. Every day, I 
see that he embodies her spirit, determination, and grace.
  Sepi was an extraordinary woman who lived a remarkable life, and I 
will always be grateful that I had the immense privilege of knowing 
her. She was a devoted mother, compassionate friend, visionary thinker, 
and dear friend. She will be forever missed by her children Nakisa 
Asefnia and Bardia Asefnia, her siblings Sofey Saidi and Taher Saidi, 
and her many friends and colleagues. She left an immeasurable mark on 
our community, and her legacy will live on for generations to come.

                        TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW BOWER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEN CALVERT

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 3, 2025

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Matthew Bower 
on the occasion of his retirement from Federal service. Over the past 
22 years, Matt has honorably served the United States in both the 
executive and legislative branches. His service to our Nation 
culminates in an exemplary and dedicated fashion as a professional 
staff member for the United States House of Representatives, Committee 
on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Defense.
  Matt&#x27;s road to Federal service began with completion of his 
undergraduate degree at St. John Fisher University in Rochester, New 
York, where he majored in Economics with a minor in Finance. Matt 
worked for three years as a private sector accountant and financial 
analyst before joining the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 
where, as a section chief and preparedness officer, Matt was charged 
with interpreting complex program policies and associated congressional 
language, identifying problem areas, and developing effective 
solutions. Little did Matt know that one day he would be on the other 
side of the coin, drafting impactful provisions and making 
recommendations that directly affect departmental policies. Matt would 
continue to rise through the ranks at the Department of Homeland 
Security, achieving the duties of branch chief of risk analysis and 
strategic initiatives, with impact on over $3 billion dollars in 
preparedness grant funding.
  It was at this point, in 2015, that Matt&#x27;s career would intersect 
with the Committee on Appropriations. As a well-respected analyst, Matt 
earned an opportunity to detail onto the staff of the Subcommittee for 
Homeland Security, chaired at the time by my good friend Judge Carter. 
Matt&#x27;s accounts included the United States Secret Service, the United 
States Coast Guard, and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. These 
are some of the most critical agencies overseen by the Homeland 
Subcommittee, and it is no surprise that Matt stood out for his ability 
to perform expert oversight and provide the chairman and clerk with 
sage advice and recommendations.
  Matt&#x27;s abilities caught the eye of the Defense Subcommittee chairman 
Rodney Frelinghuysen, and Matt&#x27;s return to the Department of Homeland 
Security was short-lived. In 2016, Matt brought his discerning eye and 
unflappable demeanor to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, where 
he would stay until the end of his service to our Nation. In his decade 
of service to the Committee, Matt has personally overseen some of the 
most significant and complex parts of the defense appropriations bill, 
including: the Department of Defense&#x27;s military personnel and operation 
and maintenance accounts, which alone comprised nearly half of the 
bill, or more during the Global War on Terror years; the Defense Health 
Program, which provides critical funds to care for servicemembers and 
their families; and several other accounts where funds are executed for 
everything from demilitarizing chemical weapons to addressing 
unexploded ordnance at current and former military sites.
  However, Matt&#x27;s last legacy on the Defense Subcommittee will be his 
years of oversight of the United States Army procurement and research, 
development, test and evaluations accounts. As the lead staffer on Army 
issues, Matt had a direct hand in the Army&#x27;s transformation from a 
counterterrorism-focused force, to one fielding capabilities to support 
the Joint force in a new era of strategic competition with near peer 
adversaries. This included the development and procurement of systems 
such as the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, the Joint Light 
Tactical Vehicle, the Next Generation Squad Weapon, the Long-Range 
Hypersonic Weapon, and numerous upgrades to existing systems such as 
the Abrams tank system enhancement packages. I personally appreciated 
his recommendations on how the Subcommittee should proceed with the 
development and acquisition of the Integrated Visual Augmentation 
System or IVAS, an augmented reality headset. Matt&#x27;s assessment ensured 
that the Congress retained its power of the purse and held the Army 
accountable for fielding a capable system.

[[Page E284]]

  Over the last 10 years, Matt has consistently proved to be a 
tremendous source of knowledge to the chairs of the Subcommittee on 
both sides of the aisle, the numerous defense clerks, and his staff 
colleagues alike. I am grateful for his counsel as the Subcommittee 
navigated a challenging period for the defense and security of our 
Nation. On behalf of a grateful Nation, I join my colleagues today in 
recognizing and commending Matt for his service to our country and wish 
him the best in his future endeavors.
