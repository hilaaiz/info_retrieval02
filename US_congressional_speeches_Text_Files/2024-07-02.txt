                 CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM LORICK

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. AARON BEAN

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Mr. William Lorick, a beloved member of our Amelia Island family.
  Born in 1947, William grew up in Augusta, Georgia before attending 
Newberry College in South Carolina. After graduating, William embarked 
on a long and extremely successful real estate career. In 1973, William 
moved to Amelia Island, Florida where he lived for the rest of his 
life.
  William was a pillar of the Amelia Island community, but his service 
to the island went far beyond that. He was key to the growth of the 
Lutheran Prince of Peace Church, he was a founding member of the 
Barnabas Center, and he was one of the first volunteers for the South 
End Auxiliary Fire Fighters. William also spent years as a mentor in 
the Big Brothers program. He might even be remembered most for his 1929 
Ford Model A, which was certainly the coolest car in town.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in celebrating the 
amazing life of William Lorick, along with offering our deepest 
condolences to his wife Stephanie, their children Barlass and Abigail, 
and to all of his friends and family who miss him dearly.

 COMMEMORATING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS 
              AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE&#x27;S CONTINENTAL CONGRESS

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Mr. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 
250th Anniversary of the First Continental Congress and Young People&#x27;s 
Continental Congress.
  The United States Congress traces its roots to the First Continental 
Congress, which convened in Carpenters&#x27; Hall in 1774 and was one of the 
most significant events in the founding of our Nation. Colonial 
delegates solidified a united American identity by adopting the 
Declaration of Colonial Rights, which outlined their grievances with 
Great Britain, and the Articles of Association, which created the 
colonial coalition that later signed the Declaration of Independence 
and fought the American Revolution. After the Revolution, the 
Continental Congress evolved into the Congress of

[[Page E690]]

the Federation and ultimately the U.S. Congress as established by the 
Constitution in 1787.
  To commemorate the 250th anniversary of the First Continental 
Congress, in July 2024 the Carpenters&#x27; Company of Philadelphia, the 
nonprofit organization founded in 1724 that owns and operates 
Carpenters&#x27; Hall, will convene the Young People&#x27;s Continental Congress 
(YPCC). From July 15-19, a diverse group of high school students and 
their teachers from the 13 original colonies will gather in 
Philadelphia to explore our Nation&#x27;s founding. A second convening in 
July 2025 will engage students and teachers from all 56 states and 
jurisdictions.
  YPCC is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to engage young people in 
history and civics as well as launch Philadelphia&#x27;s celebration of the 
Semiquincentennial of American independence in 2026. YPCC has been 
named a National Partner Program of America250 and has been endorsed by 
America250PA and Philadelphia250. YPCC delegates will discuss America&#x27;s 
founding principles and how those principles have been expressed over 
our history. They will also experience Philadelphia&#x27;s world-class 
historic attractions to enhance their understanding of the democratic 
process and how our country began. The program will provide young 
people across the country with the opportunity to share their voices 
and perspectives.
  YPCC will harness the power of convening for a new generation of 
civic leaders, who often are more connected with their peers via 
technology and social media than they are in physical time and space. 
As generations of leaders have learned, there is nothing like being 
``in the room where it happened.&#x27;&#x27;

  HONORING LIEUTENANT PATRICK L. RAWLINGS AS THE JUNE VETERAN OF THE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable valor 
and dedication of Lieutenant Patrick L. Rawlings, Sr., our 
distinguished Veteran of the Month representing Michigan&#x27;s 9th 
Congressional District. It is with utmost pride and respect that I 
highlight the extraordinary service of this true American patriot.
  Lieutenant Patrick Rawlings was born and raised in Keyser, West 
Virginia, where he graduated high school, and later attended Potomac 
State College from 1961-1962. His exemplary military career began at 19 
years old, when he enlisted in the United States Army. After enlisting, 
he began his training at Fort Knox, Kentucky and later received 
Artillery Advanced individual training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He 
continued his training, graduating with honors from the Officer 
Candidate School earning the esteemed rank of 2ND Lieutenant.
  Lieutenant Patrick Rawlings was then assigned to the 1ST Special 
Forces Group in Okinawa, which came contingent with more rigorous 
training; including Jump School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and Special 
Warfare School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. His dedication to 
excellence and unwavering courage were further demonstrated during his 
deployments to Vietnam, where he served as a member of A-Teams A/221 
and A/213 assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group. His leadership, 
valor, and unwavering commitment to his comrades-in-arms earned him the 
admiration and respect of all who served alongside him.
  Throughout his impressive military career, Lieutenant Rawlings 
exemplified the highest ideals of service and sacrifice, earning 
numerous commendations and accolades, including the Airborne 
qualification, SCUBA School certification, and promotion to the rank of 
1ST Lieutenant. His courage under fire and unwavering commitment to his 
fellow service members serve as a testament to his character and 
dedication to duty.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest 
thanks to Lieutenant Patrick L. Rawlings, Sr. His life of service and 
sacrifice serves as a powerful reminder of the debt of gratitude we owe 
to those who have defended our freedoms at home and abroad.

    HONORING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MICHIGAN MUNICIPAL LEAGUE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor and celebrate the 125th 
anniversary of the Michigan Municipal League, an organization dedicated 
to making communities better through innovation, connection, and 
service. Since its founding in 1899, the League has played a crucial 
role in enhancing municipal governance and fostering community 
development across Michigan.
  Originally known as the League of Michigan Municipalities, the League 
found a permanent home in Ann Arbor in 1928 and established an 
additional office in Lansing in 1957. Initially focused on promoting 
home rule for cities and villages, it has evolved to address a wide 
range of municipal concerns, from legislative advocacy to comprehensive 
service offerings. Today, the League represents over 500 full-service 
cities, villages, and townships. It has worked tirelessly to educate 
and inspire public servants to build trust and create a sense of 
belonging among residents and local leaders to build opportunity and 
address social and economic needs.
  The League&#x27;s motto is ``Cooperation solves any problem,&#x27;&#x27; a principle 
the organization has demonstrated for over a century by bringing 
together officials to learn from one another. Through its advocacy 
efforts and commitment to cooperation and mutual support, the League 
has highlighted the transformative power of public service in local 
governments.
  Throughout its history, the Michigan Municipal League has been 
instrumental in numerous significant initiatives. The League played a 
vital role in the construction of the Mackinac Bridge in the 1950s, a 
landmark project that connected Michigan&#x27;s Upper and Lower Peninsulas. 
Its advocacy was pivotal in the expansion of the Dial-A-Ride 
Transportation system in 1975, which greatly benefited seniors and 
individuals with disabilities. Additionally, the League championed the 
Complete Streets Act in Michigan, which was signed in 2010 and promotes 
mobility and safety for all users, including pedestrians, public 
transportation users, older individuals, and children.
  In 2009, the League, alongside the Detroit Regional Chamber and 
Transportation Riders United, formed a coalition to embrace public 
transit as a powerful economic development tool and resource for 
residents. This initiative underscored the League&#x27;s belief in 
collaborative efforts and the power of community-focused policies that 
has been a tenet of its mission since its earliest days.
  This 125th anniversary is a perfect time to recognize the Michigan 
Municipal League for its dedication to improving local governance and 
fostering vibrant, equitable communities. It is with great respect that 
I honor the League&#x27;s 125 years of service and its ongoing contributions 
to Michigan&#x27;s cities, villages, and townships. May the Michigan 
Municipal League continue to inspire and lead for many more years to 
come.

            HONORING THE CAREER OF ANTHONY (TONY) ZAMPIELLO

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the long career of 
public service provided to the people of the San Gabriel Valley and 
Southern California by Anthony (Tony) Zampiello of the San Gabriel 
Valley Water Association and the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster.
  Water policy and management is one of the most controversial, 
complicated, and costly issues in California. In my region there are 
hundreds of different water supply agencies, water treatment works, 
water distributors, and water users. One of the things that the varied 
water interests in the San Gabriel Valley agree on is the deep 
gratitude we have for the invaluable expertise of Tony Zampiello over 
the past 35 years.
  Tony has been at the forefront of managing water agencies and 
advising policy makers on historic water rights, urban water usage, 
infrastructure, federal programs, and groundwater management. As the 
primary groundwater manager in the San Gabriel Valley, Tony has 
effectively administered basin levels and usage through cycles of 
drought and heavy storm seasons. The San Gabriel Basin would not have 
withstood the severe droughts of the past decade and come back at 
heightened levels the way it did if it were not for Tony&#x27;s leadership.
  Tony has testified in Congress and provided policy advice that has 
been at the forefront of the water debates and legislation signed into 
law. He was the impetus for multiple provisions in Water Resources 
Development Acts that have led to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
improving groundwater recharge and dam operations in Southern 
California. He advocated for improved stormwater capture that led to a 
new Clean Water Act program for stormwater in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. He has championed water recycling that has spurred 
Congress to provide millions of dollars in additional Bureau of 
Reclamation funding to reuse wastewater and release it into spreading 
grounds and improve our aquifers.
  Mr. Speaker, we are happy that Tony is moving on to a much-deserved 
retirement, but we will greatly miss the reservoir of knowledge that he 
has provided to water managers and policy makers. I ask my colleagues 
to join me in congratulating Tony Zampiello on his retirement, and 
thanking him for his long career of public service to the people of 
Southern California.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life 
of Reverend Joseph L. Levesque, C.M. A faithful priest, visionary 
leader, and beloved community member. Father Levesque was a true pillar 
of our community. His unwavering commitment to service changed the 
lives of all whom he knew.
  A native of North Tarrytown, NY, Father Levesque entered the 
Congregation of the Mission after finishing high school. He completed 
his studies at Mary Immaculate Seminary in 1967 and became an ordained 
Vincentian priest. Afterwards, Father Levesque taught religious studies 
at St. John&#x27;s Preparatory School, St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary, and Niagara 
University before pursuing his Doctoral Degree in theology at Catholic 
University of America.
  In 1978, Father Levesque returned to Niagara University to continue 
teaching. Here, he was named the Dean of the College of Arts and 
Sciences and the Director of the Graduate Division.
  Returning to seminary work in 1986, Father Levesque became the 
president of St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary, a school where he previously 
taught. He was later elected provincial superior of the Eastern 
Province of Congregation of the Mission in 1990 and served a full nine-
year term.
  Father Levesque began his tenure as the 25th president of Niagara 
University in 2000. Holding this role for 13 years, he became the 
fourth longest-tenured president in the University&#x27;s history. Under his 
leadership, Father Levesque expanded the University&#x27;s footprint and 
ensured its long-term success. He led ``The Promise of Niagara . . . 
The next 150 years&#x27;&#x27; campaign, raising a record $80 million for the 
university. These funds were used to build new state of the art 
facilities on campus and to renovate existing spaces. After Father 
Levesque stepped down from the presidency in 2013, the Niagara 
University Board of Trustees voted to confer him with the title 
President Emeritus.
  At the culmination of his academic career, Father Levesque earned 
honorary degrees from Niagara University and St. John&#x27;s University, two 
of the three Vincentian institutions of higher education in the United 
States, and an honorary doctorate from Christ the King Seminary.
  Beyond academia, Father Levesque remained an active member and leader 
in the community. He served as the board chair of both St. John&#x27;s 
University and Niagara University. Additionally, Father Levesque was an 
active member of the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, a leadership 
organization for religious men in the United States. Through his roles 
as President and Liaison to the National Conference of Catholic 
Bishops&#x27; Committee on the Liturgy, Father Levesque gained national 
recognition for his work with the Catholic bishops and church 
authorities in Rome.
  Today, we celebrate the enduring legacy of Father Joseph L. Levesque. 
His commitment to faith, passion for service, and unwavering leadership 
has changed our community for the better. Please join me in honoring 
Father Levesque for a lifetime of tremendous service.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Judge 
Stanley Novack of Stamford, Connecticut.
  Judge Novack was a pillar of the Stamford community and a scion of 
Jurisprudence, serving 49 years on the bench across various judicial 
appointments in Connecticut. First elevated to the bench in 1975, Judge 
Novack was one of the longest presiding Connecticut Superior Court 
judges who had a special affinity for his time adjudicating family law 
cases. He handled these particularly fraught situations with a 
sincerity, good-humor, and empathy that regularly left litigants and 
lawyers grateful to have come before him to have their cases heard.
  Coined ``the father of family law in Connecticut&#x27;&#x27; by his colleagues 
at a celebration of his 40th year on the bench, Judge Novack was the 
recipient of numerous prestigious awards, including the Distinguished 
Service Award from the Connecticut Chapter of the American Academy of 
Matrimonial Lawyers and the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Fairfield 
County Bar Association.
  Beyond his laudatory judicial career, Judge Novack was known to be a 
truly remarkable human to his colleagues and family. He was famous for 
his uncanny ability to remember the birthdays of his fellow judges, the 
lawyers who argued before him, and the legal secretaries who 
transcribed his notes--and even their children. Alongside his wife of 
over thirty years, Muriel, Judge Novack never missed one of his 
granddaughters&#x27; ballet recitals, theater performances, or academic 
graduations. And, in keeping with his devotion to our great state, he 
was an avid fan of the UCONN Men and Women&#x27;s basketball teams, 
excitedly welcoming each of his alma matter&#x27;s national championship 
victories.
  Judge Novack&#x27;s life stands as a testament to his dedication to public 
service and commitment to his community. His legacy, both in the form 
of the case law he created and the wonderful family he leaves behind, 
will serve as a tribute to his many years of hard work. I thank Judge 
Novack for all that he did for Connecticut.

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia 
Government Accountability Office Home Rule Act. This bill would repeal 
the authority of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) over 
the District of Columbia.
  GAO, a federal agency that conducts investigations and audits for 
Congress, has the same authority over D.C. that it has over federal 
agencies. GAO&#x27;s authorizing statute defines D.C. as a federal agency. 
In addition, GAO&#x27;s authorizing statute and the D.C. Home Rule Act 
require GAO to engage in specific types of oversight of D.C.
  D.C. is not a federal agency, and it should never be treated as such. 
D.C. already has a locally appointed auditor and inspector general, so 
GAO&#x27;s authority over D.C. is both redundant and offensive. GAO does not 
have general authority over states and cities, and therefore should not 
have such authority over D.C. This bill is an important step to 
increase home rule for D.C.

  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following 
newsletter to give an update to my constituents on issues surrounding 
military readiness, national security, and the appropriations process.

       Dear Friend:
       The United States is facing unprecedented threats from 
     those who want to do us harm, so the House is prioritizing 
     policies that strengthen our nation&#x27;s security and borders.
       The House recently passed H.R. 8070, the Servicemembers 
     Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense 
     Authorization Act for FY25, which is focused on improving our 
     servicemembers&#x27; lives while restoring our military&#x27;s focus on 
     warfighting.
       I&#x27;m excited to share that this bill also included three of 
     my amendments.
       The fist requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to 
     complete a survey of the 15 counties in North Carolina&#x27;s 11th 
     District as potential locations for future defense 
     facilities. Western North Carolina&#x27;s topography is much like 
     that of many of our adversaries, including China&#x27;s, and would 
     be advantageous for military training.
       Another of my amendments requires the DOD to submit an 
     annual report to the General Services Administration about 
     office space occupancy data so that taxpayer dollars are not 
     being thrown away on unused office space by the federal 
     government.
       The third amendment would revoke the security clearances of 
     retired or active members of the armed forces or Defense 
     Department civilian employees who support or participate in 
     demonstrations in support of a designated foreign terrorist 
     organization. It should be a no-brainer that someone who 
     supports a terrorist organization should not have access to 
     classified security information.
       This year&#x27;s NDAA took an important step in getting our 
     military away from wokeness and back to its mission of 
     protecting and defending America, and I was glad to support 
     it.


                Open borders put American lives at risk.

       Protecting the long-term success of our nation and 
     Americans require defending our border.
       Since President Biden has taken office, there have been 
     more than 9.6 million illegal immigrant encounters 
     nationwide, with more than 7.9 million of them just at our 
     southern border.
       Over the past three years, the left&#x27;s failed border 
     policies have made every community in America a border 
     community, and the president&#x27;s latest executive order does 
     nothing to actually address the crisis at out southern 
     border.
       Recent news of Americans murdered by illegal immigrants 
     makes it clear that we must secure our borders to keep our 
     citizens safe. We cannot protect Americans if we don&#x27;t secure 
     our border. That&#x27;s why I helped pass the strongest border 
     security bill in history, H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, 
     which would put an end to this administration&#x27;s border crisis 
     that is putting Americans&#x27; lives at risk.


                    Appropriations season is upon us

       The House Appropriations Committee continues to fulfill our 
     Article I responsibility by moving 12 bills that fund the 
     federal government through the committee and the House floor 
     in regular order with robust debate on spending.
       A common theme that marks these appropriations bills is a 
     strong commitment to fiscal responsibility and American 
     values.
       One of the funding bills I helped pass as a member of the 
     Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee is 
     nearly 20 percent less than the president&#x27;s budget request 
     and nearly 10 percent less than the spending level in FY24. 
     Notably, this bill prioritizes agencies and programs that 
     combat terrorism financing, maintain the integrity of our 
     financial markets, spur small business growth, support the 
     judicial branch and target opioid abuse.
       After the Appropriations Committee&#x27;s passage of the 
     Defense, Homeland Security, and State, Foreign Operations, 
     and Related Programs appropriations bills, the House also 
     advanced these bills, putting our nation a step closer to 
     increasing the safety and security of the American people.
       Some of the highlights in these bills that strengthen our 
     national security include the following:
       The Defense bill refocuses the DOD on its core mission 
     preparing combat-ready military forces to deter war and 
     safeguard our national security. The measure includes 
     targeting funding to counter China and related adversaries, 
     supporting innovation to develop modernized weapons and 
     capabilities, and supporting our servicemembers and their 
     families, including giving a pay raise to all military 
     personnel.
       It also reduces waste by cutting $18 billion from the 
     president&#x27;s budget request and eliminating the use of 
     taxpayer dollars that would have gone to fund the radical 
     left&#x27;s woke agenda.
       The Homeland Security bill takes steps toward securing our 
     southern border and makes sure that the Department of 
     Homeland Security upholds federal law. The measure includes 
     providing $600 million for constructing the southern border 
     wall, sustained finding for 22,000 Border Patrol agents, and 
     prohibits the transportation of illegal immigrants into the 
     interior of the United States for purposes other than 
     enforcement.
       The State and Foreign Operations bill prioritizes agencies 
     and programs that protect our national security while 
     safeguarding our global economic interests, supporting our 
     allies, targeting our enemies and promoting freedom and 
     democracy abroad in a fiscally responsible manner, cutting 
     overall funding by 11 percent.
       The measure includes about S2 billion for U.S. national 
     security interests in the Indo-Pacific and to counter 
     influence by our adversaries, and more than $3 billion for 
     Israel to defend itself against terrorist attacks. The bill 
     also stops funding for the United Nations&#x27; regular budget, 
     terminates more than 18 unnecessary programs and eliminates 
     33 special envoys and special representatives at the 
     Department of State.
       This administration&#x27;s America Last foreign policy approach 
     has weakened the United States&#x27; standing on the world stage, 
     emboldened our adversaries such as China, Iran and Russia, 
     abandoned our allies and placed American servicemembers&#x27; 
     lives at risk.
       As the House Appropriations Committee continues to work 
     through our process of funding the government, you can follow 
     along on Facebook or X for ongoing updates.


           If Congress does not do our job, we do not go home

       Every year since 1996, Congress has failed to pass our 
     annual spending bills on time, and yet once August rolls 
     around, Congress goes home, despite work still left to be 
     done in DC. We cannot continue putting funding our federal 
     government on the backburner.
       The Constitution gives the power of the purse in Congress, 
     yet we cannot seem to get our single most important job done 
     in a timely manner.
       I&#x27;m introducing the Do Our Job Act because if our work is 
     not done, we should not go home. The American people cannot 
     afford Congress not funding our government on time. The way 
     Congress runs is broken, and this bill is one of the ways 
     that I&#x27;m waking to fix how Washington works.


                          Standing up for life

       The second anniversary of the Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark 
     Dobbs decision is a celebratory reminder that the 
     Constitution does not grant a right to abortion. This ruling 
     was a major step toward protecting unborn life. I&#x27;ll continue 
     to stand up for the most vulnerable through legislative 
     actions and advocating for expecting mothers and families so 
     that they feel empowered to choose life.


             Coming to WNC soon: New Army Reserve facility

       The Department of the Army is funding a $32 million project 
     in Asheville for the construction of a U.S. Army Reserve 
     center, vehicle maintenance facility and organizational 
     storage building in the Asheville vicinity, to be completed 
     by June 2026.
       I&#x27;m pleased that the Department of the Army has agreed with 
     the approach taken by my House-passed National Defense 
     Authorization Act (NDAA) amendment, which requires the 
     Department of Defense to complete a survey of the 15 counties 
     in North Carolina&#x27;s 11th District as potential locations for 
     future defense facilities and report to Congress on its 
     findings.

[[Page E691]]

       The new construction will not only benefit our Army 
     reservists, but it is also an opportunity for military 
     leaders to explore additional avenues for WNC to uniquely 
     contribute to doing our part to support our military and 
     reservists.


                ``Unplugged&#x27;&#x27; Town Hall in Yancey County

       Mark your calendars for Tuesday, July 16 to join my next 
     in-person town hall in Yancey County. The town hall will take 
     place from 6:00-7:30 p.m. at the Yancey County Courthouse, 
     110 Town Sq., Burnsville, NC.
       I&#x27;m looking forward to sharing an update about the latest 
     legislative opportunities and challenges in Congress and 
     answering questions about the issues that matter to you.
           With my warmest regards,
                                                    Chuck Edwards,
     Member of Congress.

                         Tuesday, July 2, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary 
life and service of Stanislau ``Stan&#x27;&#x27; Wojcik, a proud veteran from 
Michigan&#x27;s 9th Congressional District, who passed away on June 9, 2024.

honor, and sacrifice from a young age. His service in the South Pacific 
during World War II, and particularly in his role aboard the USS 
Sarasota, stands as a testament to his sense of service.
  During his service, Stan participated in critical operations 
throughout the war. Stan aided in disaster relief after the explosion 
of the USS Mt. Hood, the Battle of Luzon, the Battle of Manila, the 
Battle of Okinawa, and the invasion of Ie Shima. His contributions 
during these campaigns underscored his unwavering commitment to 
defending our Nation during one of the most defining eras of our 
history.
  Throughout his service, Stan Wojcik was awarded numerous honors 
recognizing his bravery and dedication, including the Combat Action 
Ribbon, China Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic Pacific 
Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Navy Occupation Service 
Medal, Honorable Service Lapel Pin, Philippine Republic Presidential 
Unit Citation, and the Philippine Liberation Ribbon.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in offering Stanislau 
Wojcik&#x27;s family, friends, and community our deepest condolences. We are 
indebted to his generation for their bravery, sacrifice, and 
leadership.

                 THE STATE OF VOTING RIGHTS IN AMERICA

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 25, 2024

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for 
hosting this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order to discuss the 
issue at the heart of American democracy--our right to vote.
  This right is fundamental to our democracy and a threat to it is a 
threat to America itself.
  A crucial benchmark of progress and inclusion in this country has 
been the passage of one of the most important pieces of legislation in 
our nation&#x27;s history--the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
  Signed in to law by President Johnson, this legislation helped to 
reinforce America&#x27;s promise of a truly democratic Nation and our 15th 
Amendment prohibition on denying Black Americans the right to vote.
  The Voting Rights Act served as a beacon for full political 
participation and engagement in our nation for all Americans.
  Because of that law, I stand before you as Congresswoman Sheila 
Jackson Lee, the first African American woman Ranking Member of the 
House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, and a Senior Member on the 
Judiciary, Homeland Security, and the Budget Committees.
  On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol and in the presence 
of such luminaries as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rev. 
Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; Roy 
Wilkins of the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National Urban League; James 
Foreman of the Congress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of the 
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis of the Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert 
Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President Johnson addressed the Nation 
before signing the Voting Rights Act:
  ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for 
breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which 
imprison men because they are different from other men.&#x27;&#x27;
  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter 
discrimination violations that historically left millions of African 
Americans disenfranchised.
  In 1940, for example, only about 3 percent of African Americans 
living in the South were registered to vote.
  Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major 
causes of these racially discriminatory results.
  In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were 
approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just 
three in Congress.
  Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the 
South.
  Because of the Voting Rights Act, today there are more than 9,100 
black elected officials, including approximately 60 members of 
Congress, the largest number ever.
  Additionally, for the first time in our history, we have a Vice 
President, Kamala D. Harris, the first woman, first Black person and 
first Asian American to be sworn into that role.
  Furthermore, we have the first Black woman, Ketanji Brown Jackson, 
serving as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.
  The Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many of the 
approximately 7,000 Hispanic public officials that have been elected 
and appointed nationwide, including 56 of whom serve in Congress.
  Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered 
harsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited 
greatly.
  The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Section 2, which 
prohibits the implementation of voting practices or procedures that 
discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in one of the 
language minority groups identified in Section 4(f)(2) of the Act.
  Historically, section 5 of the Voting Rights Act provided the crucial 
pre-clearance formula--a vital proactive measure to determine which 
states and jurisdictions were required to preclear new voting laws with 
the Department of Justice or a Federal Court.
  For nearly 50 years, section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and the 
preclearance formula outlined in section 4 moderated many of the

[[Page E688]]

worst abuses and resulted in many states adopting voting laws and 
redistricting plans with an eye to satisfying the concerns of minority 
voters.
  Despite Section 5&#x27;s long history and crucial role in ensuring our 
democracy was by all the people and for all the people, 11 years ago 
the Supreme Court made a disastrous decision that crippled the Voting 
Rights Act and endangered voting rights nationwide.
  In its 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, the Supreme Court 
gutted the VRA, striking down section 4&#x27;s crucial preclearance formula, 
rendering the proactive protections of section 5 unusable.
  No longer could the Voting Rights Act take a proactive, preemptive 
role to stopping discriminatory legislation.
  Since then, the need to protect the right to vote and safeguard our 
democracy has never been more urgent.
  Following the Shelby County decision, state legislatures have 
targeted voters and erected deliberate barriers to the ballot box in 
what amounts to the most concerted effort to restrict voting access in 
generations. These new restrictive, discriminatory voting laws have 
included closing polling stations and reducing their hours, curbing 
early voting and vote by mail options, imposing strict ID requirements, 
limiting access to multi-lingual voting materials, and making more 
difficult to register to vote.
  According to the Brennan Center for Justice, at least 31 states have 
passed 103 restrictive voting laws since the Shelby County v. Holder 
decision in 2013 (as of May 2024). These measures disproportionately 
impact voters of color, Native American voters, voters with 
disabilities, and the elderly.
  A 2018 Brennan Center report concluded that states previously covered 
under the preclearance formula have purged voters off their rolls at a 
significantly higher rate than non-covered jurisdictions now that their 
new laws are no longer subject to the same level of oversight.
  However, threats to voting rights nationwide have not stopped there.
  The Supreme Court has continued to undermine key provisions of the 
Voting Rights Act.
  In July 2021, in its Brnovich v. DNC and Arizona Republican Party v. 
DNC, the Supreme Court upheld racially discriminatory voter 
restrictions in Arizona despite evidence that these laws were 
intentionally designed to target Latino and other minority voters.
  In doing so, the Court further weakened the Voting Rights Act, making 
it harder to challenge discriminatory laws under Section 2&#x27;s anti-
discrimination provisions.
  Yet, the threats have not stopped there.
  With the 2024 election approaching, voting rights have never been 
more important and yet have increasingly come under fire.
  Since January of 2024, at least six states have enacted seven 
restrictive laws.
  Some states have spent the past few years piling on restrictions.
  Voters in 28 states will face new restrictions that weren&#x27;t in place 
in the last presidential election.
  These include a new law in Alabama and Idaho that broadly 
criminalizes certain forms of assistance with absentee voting and mail 
ballots, limiting voting access for elderly voters, voters with 
disabilities, and those with limited access to transportation.
  Indiana enacted a law that heightens the chances that naturalized 
citizens will be wrongly removed from the voting rolls.
  A new law in Tennessee restricts the time frame voters have to 
request an absentee ballot.
  A new Arizona law shortens the period during which voters may correct 
issues with their signatures on mail ballots.
  A new West Virginia law now requires county clerks to cancel the 
registrations of voters who get out of state driver&#x27;s licenses, 
creating a burden on students, military members, and others who 
temporarily reside outside the state but intend to return and therefore 
remain eligible to vote in West Virginia.
  In my home state of Texas, new restrictions have been implemented on 
absentee voting and new legislation empowers the state to more freely 
purge voter rolls--a process that often results in legitimate voters 
unknowingly being removed and finding themselves unable to vote come 
November.
  In the face of all these threats, what can be done to preserve voting 
rights?
  One crucial step is the passage of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act.
  This landmark legislation would restore and modernize the protections 
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
  In doing so, it would protect the right to vote and safeguard our 
democracy by preventing restrictive, discriminatory voting laws from 
taking effect.
  It does so by establishing a new modern-day framework to determine 
which states and localities have a recent history of discrimination and 
require such jurisdictions to preclear new election changes, preventing 
restrictive and discriminatory voting laws from taking effect.
  In other words, it revives and refreshes the preclearance formula for 
the modern era, enabling Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to once 
again preemptively prevent threats to voting rights.
  It also restores Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by eliminating 
the heightened standard required to challenge discriminatory voting 
laws created by the Supreme Court in Brnovich v. DNC.
  Voting rights should not be a partisan issue.
  It is the duty and responsibility of Congress to safeguard voting 
rights across our Nation.
  Our freedom to vote is our most sacred and fundamental right.
  It is the right upon which all our other rights rest, and allows us 
to determine the future of our communities and families, and ensure 
opportunities for all.
  Since enactment, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been reauthorized 
five times with large, bipartisan majorities.
  The VRA&#x27;s most recent authorization occurred in 2006 when it passed 
unanimously in the U.S. Senate (98-0) and was signed by Republican 
President George W. Bush.
  There is no reason that the effort to restore the VRA to its full 
strength should be any different.
  While Republicans veered away from this bipartisan tradition last 
Congress, opposing the bill in the House and blocking debate in the 
Senate, this Congress provides a new opportunity to side with the 
American people and the fundamental principle that everyone has an 
equal opportunity to have their voice heard and vote counted.
  We must reject the cynicism that Republicans at the highest level 
have espoused when talking about making voting more accessible for all.
  Allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is not a ``power 
grab.&#x27;&#x27;
  For democracy to work for all of us, it must include us all, no 
matter our background.
  The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore and 
modernize the essential portion of the Voting Rights Act that blocks 
discriminatory voting policies before they go into effect, creating a 
transparent process for protecting everyone&#x27;s freedom to vote.
  I have also repeatedly introduced legislation that further enshrines 
our voting rights.
  H.R. 42--the Coretta Scott King Mid-Decade Redistricting Prohibition 
Act prohibits a state where the congressional districts have been 
redistricted after a decennial census from carrying out another 
redistricting until after the next apportionment of Representatives 
following a decennial census, unless a court requires the state to 
conduct a subsequent redistricting to comply with the Constitution or 
enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
  This legislation was also a response to the Shelby County decision, 
as after the 2020 census, many state legislatures redrew aggressive new 
measures now that they were no longer subject to preclearance.
  For example, Republicans in North Carolina converted a congressional 
map that elected 8 Republicans and 5 Democrats into one that could 
elect 11 Republicans and just 3 Democrats.
  The North Carolina map was skewed in a way that targets Black 
political power, meaning that a state that is 20 percent Black could 
have only a single Black member of Congress representing them.
  Congressional maps in Texas, Ohio, and Georgia are also all 
considered severe partisan gerrymanders.
  This redistricting cycle also saw unprecedented efforts to undermine 
the political power of Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native communities, 
especially in Southern states.
  While redistricting after a new census is almost always a partisan 
process, this bill protects the redistricting process from being 
employed too often to skew the maps even further.
  Under H.R. 42, once the first redistricting is complete after the new 
census, the state&#x27;s maps cannot be redrawn again until the next census, 
unless a court mandates otherwise.
  Like the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, this is another 
vital piece of legislation that should receive broad support from my 
colleagues as it enshrines voting rights nationwide and preserves the 
legacy of the Voting Rights Act.
  Mr. Speaker, for millions of Americans, the right to vote protected 
by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the 
sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the 
world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things.
  Let us honor their commitment and sacrifice by enshrining the 
legislative protections they fought for.
