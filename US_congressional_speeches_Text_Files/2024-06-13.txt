                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I am grateful to 
honor the remarkable life of Major William Henry Luther, a highly 
decorated hero of the Vietnam War, who will be laid to rest at the 
Dallas-Fort Worth Veterans National Cemetery in Dallas, Texas on June 
20th. Major Luther, the brother of Second District resident and 
Publisher of Linc, Inc. community newspapers, Kirk Luther, also leaves 
behind wife Jackie Mae, daughter Tracey, son Robert, five 
grandchildren, one great grandchild, and numerous extended family 
members and friends. I offer my sympathy to his family.
  I include in the Record the following obituary for William Henry 
Luther:

       William Henry Luther, a veteran of the war in Vietnam and 
     longtime resident of Edgecliff Village, Texas, passed away on 
     December 10, 2023 in his home. Bill, as he was known to most, 
     was born November 7, 1939 to Kirk Charles Luther and 
     Elizabeth (Betty) Jane Luther in Berwyn, Illinois. He 
     enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1956. Bill was first deployed to 
     Korea where he served with a medical unit and was there when 
     President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
       After Korea, Bill was deployed to Vietnam for three combat 
     tours during the 60s. For

[[Page E629]]

     his heroic actions as a helicopter pilot fighting in some of 
     the bloodiest battles with the 1st Air Cavalry Division 
     including the TET Offensive and the City of Hue, Khe Sahn, 
     and the invasion of the A&#x27;Shau Valley, the U.S. Army 
     recognized Bill for his honorable service with a Silver Star 
     (one of the highest honors to be bestowed upon a combat 
     veteran) the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star (1st 
     OLC), the Purple Heart, the Air Medal, National Defense 
     Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal w/DVC 60, Vietnam Cross 
     of Gallantry w/PALM, Senior Army Aviation Badge, Army Aviator 
     Badge, Armed Forces Reservice Medal, Good Conduct Medal, 
     Vietnam Civil Actions Medal (Unit Citation), Valorous Unit 
     Citation and the Meritorious Service Medal. Bill was the true 
     definition of a warrior and retired from military service 
     with the rank of Major after 22 years, 5 months and 5 days 
     from Fort Jackson, South Carolina.
       Bill married Jackie Mae Riddle on July 22, 1967 at Fort 
     Rucker, Alabama, and together they raised two children, 
     Robert and Tracey.
       After his retirement from military service Bill joined 
     Defender Industries in Columbia, SC and was promoted to the 
     Senior Operations Officer of the southwestern territory which 
     included Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico. During that time he 
     moved his family to Ft. Worth and eventually Edgecliff 
     Village where he resided until his passing. Bill was an avid 
     golfer and served two terms as an Alderman on the Edgecliff 
     Village City Council.
       Bill is survived by his wife Jackie Mae Luther of Fort 
     Worth, TX.; his daughter, Tracey Scancella and husband, Jimmy 
     Aguirre; his son, Robert S. Luther and wife, Debra M. Luther, 
     as well as five grandchildren, Jonathan Scancella, Joseph 
     Scancella, Bradley W. Luther, Kristina K. Luther, Kelli M. 
     Luther and one great grandchild, Theadore W. Luther; his 
     brother, Kirk F. Luther and wife Kathy A. Luther along with 2 
     nephews, Aaron K. Luther and Nicholas C. Luther and two great 
     nephews, Jonah Luther and Elijah Luther.

     at 11:00 am. Remembrances can be made by visiting Wounded 
     Warrior Project at support.woundedwarriorproject.org.

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and 
congratulate Rocky&#x27;s Pasties on their 100-year anniversary. I am 
extremely grateful to be able to celebrate this incredible milestone 
with the Rocky&#x27;s Pasties family and our community. A small takeout food 
business specializing in hand made Cornish style pastries, Rocky&#x27;s has 
been family owned and operated for four generations. For the past 100 
years, they have shown their dedication to delivering meals the old-
fashioned way while carrying a piece of their ancestors with them. They 
have shown their commitment to this community by preparing daily meals 
from scratch, using only the freshest ingredients. The Rocky&#x27;s Pasties 
friendly environment is a testament to their 100-year history. Rocky&#x27;s 
Pasties has been described as an ``unexpected gem&#x27;&#x27; but if you are a 
part of this community you know it is no surprise. As we reflect on the 
past 100 years at Rocky&#x27;s they have exceeded the expectations and I 
know they will continue to do so for the next 100 years to come. I am 
honored to have such an amazing community in the 7th congressional 
district, and I look forward to what is to come.

                          ____________________

       HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF DR. GEORGE EVERETT BARNES

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and service of a tenacious and self-motivated leader, the late Dr. 
George Everett Barnes. Dr. Barnes showed what could be done through 
hard work, dedication, and a desire to achieve success.
  Dr. George Everett Barnes was born in Collins, MS, on August 10, 
1941. He was the youngest of nine siblings born to Elmer and Lora 
Barnes. During the course of his life, his parents stressed the 
importance of God, family, education, and hard work. He would find his 
calling as a devoted husband, father, educator, and servant. These 
values are evidenced by the fact that all nine siblings attended and 
graduated from Jackson State University. They went on to establish the 
Barnes Family Endowed Scholarship Fund to aid students majoring in 
education.
  Dr. Barnes graduated from Carver Central High School in Collins and 
went on to advance his education at Jackson State University (BS, 
Mathematics), Louisiana State University (MA, Mathematics), Mississippi 
State University (EdS, Community College Education), and the University 
of Southern Mississippi (PhD, Educational Administration). He furthered 
his studies at the University of Illinois and Auburn University.
  While attending Jackson State University, he met his wife, Doris. 
They married in June 1963 and celebrated their 61st anniversary

[[Page E630]]

this year. To this union, three children were born: Cheryl Barnes, 
Gregory Barnes, and Kimberly McCants.
  Dr. Barnes began his career as a mathematics teacher at Hinds 
Agricultural High School in 1962. This would begin his 51-year 
professional and family life in Utica. During his tenure, Dr. Barnes 
served as an assistant basketball coach, college math instructor, Hinds 
AHS Principal, and Academic Dean and Acting President of Utica Junior 
College. When he retired, he was the Vice President for the Utica and 
Vicksburg-Warren Campuses and Administrative and Student Services.
  Dr. Barnes loved meeting people, talking to people, and helping them 
as well. He valued knowing that he made a difference in the lives of 
others and served as a positive role model for his family, friends, and 
colleagues. His interests in building humanity, specifically, were time 
consuming yet fulfilling. He worked tirelessly to build the cultural 
character in the surrounding communities. He leaves a legacy of 
dedicated and committed leadership, and his work never went unnoticed.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life, 
legacy, and service of Dr. George Everett Barnes for his passion and 
unwavering dedication in the field of education. May his legacy 
continue in our hearts and in our interactions with friends and family.

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, on May 8, 2024 we lost my father, Lou Soto. He 
was an amazing dad, loving husband, and joyful grandfather. He was a 
Navy veteran, computer programmer, as well as a football, baseball and 
basketball fan. He had a calm, loving, and amiable demeaner, one that 
inspired peace in others. He had many friends, loved to dance, grill, 
host BBQs and listen to music.
  His story embodied the American Dream. Born in Manati, Puerto Rico, 
he traveled to the mainland at nine years old. He then served in the 
Navy as a young man during the Vietnam era. He and my mother, Jean, 
bought their first home thanks to a VA Loan and attended college thanks 
to the GI Bill, where he took night classes to finish his degree while 
working in the day and raising his young family. He worked in computers 
and information technology for many years. He now leaves behind his 
wife Jean, son Lou, grandchildren LJ, Mateo, and Sabrina, and myself as 
well as many other family members. The imprint he has left on our 
lives, we will carry with us forever.
  He was a Catholic and man of faith. Our family will miss him dearly, 
knowing he now joins the angels, and is finally at peace.

   HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF DETECTIVE PAUL DiGIACOMO--JUNE 26, 2024

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to include in the Record the 
following Proclamation honoring the retirement of Detective Paul 
DiGiacomo:
  Whereas: Detective Paul DiGiacomo, President of the Detectives&#x27; 
Endowment Association, Inc. (DEA), is to be recognized on June 26, 
2024, on the occasion of his retirement from the New York Police 
Department. The people of New York City thank him for his four decades 
of service and his commitment to representing the interests of 
approximately 18,000 active and retired New York Police Department 
Detectives, the largest detectives&#x27; union globally.
  Whereas: A Brooklyn native and the son of a transit police officer, 
Detective DiGiacomo commenced his service in law enforcement with the 
Housing Police in 1983 before transitioning to the New York Police 
Department in 1985.
  Whereas: Throughout his distinguished career spanning nearly four 
decades, Detective DiGiacomo has served in various capacities, from 
patrolling the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn to working in plainclothes 
with the Borough&#x27;s Anti-Crime Unit, demonstrating his dedication to 
protecting and serving the community.
  Whereas: Detective DiGiacomo&#x27;s ascent within the NYPD ranks was 
marked by his diligent work in the Brooklyn South Narcotics unit, where 
he rose to prominence in the Major Case Unit while concurrently 
advocating for his fellow officers as a delegate for the Patrolmen&#x27;s 
Benevolent Association (PBA).
  Whereas: Recognized for his exceptional investigative skills, 
Detective DiGiacomo earned his Detective&#x27;s gold shield in 1993 and 
continued to excel in assignments within the Organized Crime 
Investigation Division (OCID), including roles in various gun units and 
narcotics task forces.
  Whereas: In 1999, Detective DiGiacomo assumed the role of Sergeant-
at-Arms for the DEA, a position he held with distinction until his 
promotion to Detective, second grade, by the NYPD in December 2001, in 
recognition of his exemplary service in an extensive undercover 
operation related to the homicide of a Queens Police Officer.
  Whereas: Detective DiGiacomo&#x27;s leadership within the DEA continued to 
evolve as he was elected to successive positions on the Executive 
Board, culminating in his appointment as President in January 2020, 
where he now leads the union in navigating challenges ranging from 
collective bargaining to legislative advocacy amidst a complex socio-
political landscape. DiGiacomo spearheads all union activity, including 
collective bargaining, political activities, overseeing the health and 
welfare funds, the Annuity Fund, and the union&#x27;s not-for-profit 
charity, the DEA Widows&#x27; and Children&#x27;s Fund. The union also engages in 
a wide variety of internal and external public relations ventures and 
fraternal functions.
  Whereas: Under Detective DiGiacomo&#x27;s stewardship, the DEA remains 
steadfast in its mission to protect the rights and welfare of its 
members, advocating against detrimental policies such as ``bail 
reform&#x27;&#x27; and spearheading initiatives like the legislation named after 
Detective Brian Simonsen aimed at combating cellphone theft.
  Whereas: Despite facing unprecedented challenges, including the 
COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and civil unrest, Detective 
DiGiacomo remains resolute in his commitment to advancing the interests 
of NYPD Detectives with unwavering solidarity and dedication.
  It is with great admiration and gratitude that we recognize Detective 
Paul DiGiacomo for his exceptional leadership and tireless advocacy on 
behalf of the dedicated men and women of the New York Police 
Department.

retire from active duty in the United States Army on 1 September 2024.
  A native son of Massachusetts, and a decorated combat veteran who 
served and led our Nation&#x27;s finest in combat during Operations Desert 
Shield, Desert Storm, Joint Forge, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, 
General Sullivan epitomizes the consummate soldier, servant leader, and 
advocate for our servicemembers and their families. Over the course of 
his exceptional career, he has successfully led at the tactical, 
operational, and strategic level to defend this Nation, decisively win 
our battles, and advance our most critical national objectives. Whether 
at the head of the 548th Corps Support Battalion and the 595th 
Transportation Brigade, as the 27th Chief of Transportation and 
Commandant of the U.S. Army Transportation School, as the Commander of 
the 19th Expeditionary Sustainment Command stationed in the Republic of 
Korea, as the Commander of the 1st Theater Sustainment Command 
stationed in the United States Central Command theater, or as the 
Deputy Commander of U.S. Transportation Command, General Sullivan 
unquestionably exemplified the best the Army has to offer in its 
officer corps.
  While at U.S. Transportation Command, General Sullivan personally 
endeavored to inform this Congress of the readiness of strategic 
mobility forces critical to deploying, maneuvering, sustaining, and 
redeploying the most capable military in our Nation&#x27;s history. More 
importantly, he ensured that the Joint Staff, Department of Defense, 
and this Congress were aligned in understanding the criticality of 
recapitalizing our aging strategic sealift fleets, aerial refueling 
assets, and strategic airlift fleets to sustain our competitive 
advantage over potential near-peer adversaries in global power 
projection. In close partnership with the National Defense 
Transportation Association, General Sullivan worked diligently to 
enhance our national emergency preparedness programs so that the 
Defense Transportation System remained ready and responsive to emergent 
national security needs. We all witnessed the power of these essential 
relationships and capabilities in 2021, when U.S. Transportation 
Command helped execute the largest noncombatant evacuation operation in 
history, Operation Allies Refuge, relocating over 124,000 refugees over 
a 14-day period.
  In his address to Congress in 1951, General Douglas MacArthur noted 
that ``old soldiers never die--they just fade away.&#x27;&#x27; Mr. Speaker, I 
could not in good conscience let Lieutenant General John P. Sullivan 
simply fade away

without recognizing his sustained loyalty, duty, respect, selfless 
service, honor, integrity, and personal courage over 37 years of 
devoted service to this great Nation. I wish him and his family well in 
retirement.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MARILYN STRICKLAND

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Ms. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major General 
Bret Daugherty, who will retire at the end of this month from the 
Washington National Guard, after 44 years of service protecting the 
great state of Washington and our nation.
  Major General Daugherty began his military service in 1980, serving 
nine years on Active Duty in the Army. After transitioning to the Army 
National Guard, he rose to the rank of Adjutant General and became the 
longest-serving National Guard leader in the United States.
  At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Major General Daugherty 
navigated unprecedented emergencies across the state of Washington with 
diligence. Whether he was facilitating access to vaccinations and 
masks, responding to some of our state&#x27;s worst natural disasters, or 
ensuring the security of our national elections, he completed these 
duties with unfaltering resiliency.
  Major General Daugherty&#x27;s accomplishments also laid the groundwork 
for an improved collaborative environment that Washingtonians benefit 
from today. When I had the honor of meeting with him in 2021, I was 
particularly inspired by his dedication to public service and 
commitment to supporting the members of Washington&#x27;s National Guard. 
His mindfulness of the future of our nation, and care for the personnel 
who serve it, are clear in both his words and actions.
  I commend Major General Daugherty on his decades of service to 
Washingtonians and the Guard. Congratulations on his retirement and may 
he enjoy this next chapter.

RECOGNIZING MY CONSTITUENT ADVOCATE, DAVID CHERNACK, FOR HIS EXCELLENT 
                     WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA&#x27;S

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEAN PHILLIPS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Constituent 
Advocate, David Chernack, for his work on behalf of every constituent 
in Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District. At the end of April, David 
departed my office for a new opportunity to serve as the Immigration 
Constituent Advocate in the Office of Rep. Angie Craig, and I could not 
be more proud or grateful for his service.
  Hailing from California, David came to Minnesota for college at the 
University of Minnesota. While in college, David got hooked on 
Minnesota politics and spent time interning for Senator Amy Klobuchar 
and Governor Tim Walz before graduating and joining our office.
  The constituents of Minnesota&#x27;s Third District were fortunate to be 
served by David who always went the extra mile to help a constituent in 
need. David&#x27;s ability to treat each individual as if they were his top 
priority has impressed our entire office. In under a year, he held two 
job titles- Staff Assistant and Hospitality Director and most recently, 
Constituent Advocate- and brought intellectual rigor, tireless 
dedication, and trademark quirkiness to each role. Our fondest memories 
include his drives to random parking lots to shepherd lost constituents 
to our office, lunches consisting of three variations of simple carbs 
with no protein or produce in sight, and expressions of undying 
gratitude when given even the smallest treat.
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have his dedication and leadership, and he will be dearly missed. 
However, I&#x27;m extraordinarily happy that he will continue to do this 
work and serve the Nation and the people of Minnesota&#x27;s Second 
Congressional District. I wish David all the best in his future 
endeavors and thank him for a year of faithful service to this Nation--
and many more to come.

   RECOGNIZING THE 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF EVAPCO, INC. IN MADERA COUNTY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN S. DUARTE

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, June 13, 2024

  Mr. DUARTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the momentous 
occasion of Evapco&#x27;s 45th anniversary and the significant completion of 
the Sierra building expansion in 2024.
  Evapco is a global industry-leading manufacturing company with global 
resources and solutions for worldwide heat transfer applications, it is 
employee owned, and was founded in the United Slates. Evapco launched 
its second U.S. manufacturing company in Madera, California, in 1979, 
and now employs more than 234 individuals.
  Evapco&#x27;s expansion in Madera County has not only created more jobs in 
the congressional district that I represent but is also a testament to 
my constituents&#x27; dedication and hard work. It also has bolstered 
Evapco&#x27;s production capabilities and will help it meet growing demand 
for advanced cooling solutions in our community, the Central Valley of 
California, and beyond.
  My constituents enjoy working for Evapco as it follows the vision of 
``one global team, united to be universally recognized as the superior 
provider of a full spectrum of heat transfer solutions.&#x27;&#x27; And its 
commitment to teamwork has enabled its employees--my constituents--to 
excel. It is a team their employees and customers alike can count on 
for a lifetime.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of 
Representatives to join me in celebrating Evapco&#x27;s 45th anniversary in 
California and recognizing its success in expanding in my district to 
produce innovative water-saving, ``Eco-Air&#x27;&#x27; dry-cooling products, 
which will improve the quality of life of my constituents, 
Californians, and communities around the world.
