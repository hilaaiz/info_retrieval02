           CONGRATULATING DR. BETH HALDEMAN ON HER RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. LLOYD SMUCKER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor and congratulate Dr. 
Beth Haldeman on her retirement after 25 years with Cocalico School 
District.
  Dr. Beth Haldeman&#x27;s history with Cocalico School District, located in 
northern Lancaster County, began in 2000 as the reading specialist and 
principal at the former Schoeneck Elementary School. She served in a 
similar capacity when she became principal of Denver Elementary in 2002 
and then principal at Reamstown Elementary in 2008. In 2019, Dr. 
Haldeman joined the district administration as assistant superintendent 
for curriculum and instruction. In this crucial and wide-ranging role, 
she oversaw state and local assessments, library services, professional 
development, special services, and academic supports.
  Though she will be greatly missed by the Cocalico School District, 
Dr. Haldeman&#x27;s experience and contributions to education will be 
utilized in her new role as the director of professional development 
for the Pennsylvania Principals Association, where she will be training 
future principals across Pennsylvania.
  Dr. Beth Haldeman&#x27;s contributions to the Cocalico School District 
have left a lasting impact on both the school district and 
Pennsylvania&#x27;s 11th Congressional District, which has no shortage of 
selfless educators.
  I thank Dr. Haldeman for her service and wish her all the best in her 
new career.

                 HONORING GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANNY K. DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, June is Gun Violence Awareness 
Month, a time to raise awareness about gun violence and its devastating 
impact on our citizens and Nation. It is a time to honor the lives of 
those tragically taken due to gun violence, to recognize that gun 
violence inflicts trauma and tragedy on individuals, families, and 
communities, and to advance effective gun violence prevention efforts.
  In 2023, there were nearly 47,000 firearm-related deaths, which is 
approximately 128 people dying due to firearms every day. In 2024, more 
than 500 mass shootings occurred--more than one a day. Gun violence is 
the leading cause of death of children and teens. Yet the Trump 
Administration pushes action after action to make Americans more likely 
to suffer gun violence.
  President Trump effectively legalized machine guns, rescinded 
millions of dollars in grants for gun violence reduction, eliminated 
gun violence data, and revoked the zero-tolerance policy that was a 
powerful tool for combatting gun trafficking and straw purchases. 
Further, the Republican budget bill would eliminate the gun silencer 
tax on the purchase or transfer of silencers and eliminate silence 
registrations. The Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans 
seek to undo decades of progress reducing gun violence. It is 
imperative that we continue to fight for the right for our youth to 
live in a society where they do not have to worry constantly about gun 
violence.
  Illinois and the City of Chicago have made great progress in 
implementing programs that reduce gun violence. Three years ago, 
Illinois created the Office of Firearm Violence Prevention which is 
responsible for awarding grants to organizations rooted in helping 
reduce gun violence, including the Chicago-based Peacekeepers Program. 
The Peacekeepers Program currently serves around 30 communities. In the 
communities that the Peacekeepers served, there was a 31 percent 
reduction in gun violence in 2023 and 2024 compared to the previous two 
years. Illinois and the City of Chicago can implement strict gun 
regulations and fund programs that reduce gun violence, but if 
neighboring states like Indiana and Wisconsin keep weak restrictions in 
place, then almost anyone can cross those state borders and acquire a 
gun.
  We must do more. We must limit the number of guns that exist in our 
country. We must

[[Page E616]]

ban assault weapons and enact strong background checks with no 
loopholes. We must repeal immunity for firearm manufacturers so 
individuals can bring civil actions to hold these companies responsible 
for their role in the gun violence epidemic. We must provide funding 
for programs with demonstrated success in reducing gun violence.
  During my time in Congress, I have worked diligently to pass 
legislation that will effectively regulate firearms and reduce gun 
violence. I lead the Ammo Identification Act and the Gun Violence 
Prevention and Safe Communities Act. These bills aim to reduce gun 
violence by requiring serial numbers to be engraved on ammunition to 
improve and creating guaranteed funding for gun violence prevention 
programs by increasing the excise tax on firearms and ammunition.
  Gun violence is a public health crisis, and our federal government 
must lead the effort to enact effective gun violence prevention 
legislation.

     HONORING PASTOR ALTON BRIDGES FOR 25 YEARS OF PASTORAL SERVICE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. JONATHAN L. JACKSON

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
remarkable dedication and 25 years of pastoral service of Pastor Alton 
Bridges of Park Manor M.B. Church, located at 8328 S. Green St., 
Chicago, Illinois.
  Born in Chicago on July 23, 1964, Pastor Bridges is a true native of 
our great city. He received his foundational education at Chicago 
Vocational School before earning a Bachelor of Arts in Electrical 
Engineering from DeVry Institute of Technology.
  Pastor Bridges has been an integral part of the church community his 
entire life, ultimately answering a call to ministry.
  Before his pastoral journey, he held a supervisory position at a 
company then known as Eleck Tech.
  For a quarter of a century, Pastor Bridges has faithfully served his 
congregation and the wider community. His commitment extends far beyond 
the walls of his church. Annually, he provides crucial food services to 
the greater Auburn-Gresham, South Shore, and Ashburn Wright 
communities. He actively partners with local grammar schools, assisting 
families in need by garnering donations to provide them with clothing, 
funding, and food.
  In 2020, Pastor Bridges initiated a ``Garden of Church,&#x27;&#x27; offering 
fresh vegetation to anyone in need--a testament to his innovative 
approach to community support. He actively collaborates with 
neighborhood stakeholders and is a vital part of the ``1st Ladies of 
Initiatives.&#x27;&#x27;
  His generosity also reaches beyond Chicago, as he consistently 
donates to national relief efforts, exemplified by his fundraising for 
families impacted by the California fires. Furthermore, he makes annual 
donations to support college-bound students, investing in the next 
generation.
  Pastor Bridges is a devoted family man, supported by his wife, 
Phyllis Bridges, and their children, Symone, Markeeta, and Phillip.
  Pastor Alton Bridges&#x27;s unwavering commitment to his faith, his 
congregation, and the well-being of the Chicago community is truly 
commendable. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
his 25 years of profound pastoral service and his enduring impact on 
the lives of countless individuals.

   HONORING STEVE MARANS, MSW, PhD, ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with my profound gratitude and deep 
admiration that I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend, Dr. 
Steven Marans, as he celebrates his retirement from a distinguished 
career is psychiatry including more than four decades of extraordinary 
leadership and service at the Yale Child Study Center and in the field 
of child trauma.
  We know that trauma affects the human mind in a multitude of ways and 
there is no predicting how one might process a traumatic event--the 
number of different reactions as numerous as there are individuals. 
This is particularly true for children, all too often too young to 
fully understand the violence, stress, or trauma they may be 
experiencing. There are few, not only in this country but in this 
world, that understand that better than Dr. Steven Marans.
  Some of my first real interactions and discussions with Dr. Marans 
came when he founded the Child Development-Community Policing Program. 
This pioneering effort was based on the collaboration of mental health 
and law enforcement professionals in responding to children and 
families exposed to violence and trauma. He found a better way to help 
children and their families in their darkest hours. It is a program 
that I was proud to secure federal funding for and one that has since 
been replicated in communities both here in the United States and 
abroad. Dr. Marans went on to become the Director of the Yale Child 
Study Center as well as the cofounder of the Child and Family Traumatic 
Stress Intervention, an evidence-based, early intervention that has 
been disseminated nationally and internationally, improving outcomes 
for countless children and families.
  Over the course of our careers, I have often sought his counsel, 
turning to him for advice and as a resource when our communities and 
our Nation faced traumatic events. From the attacks on 9/11 to the 
Sandy Hook shooting; from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic to the 
forced separation of families, Dr. Marans has only ever been a phone 
call away, and he has never not answered the call. I am not the only 
policymaker or community leader to have benefitted from his expertise 
and knowledge. Indeed, in addition to all of his work, Dr. Marans has 
also dedicated countless hours as a professor, a mentor, and advocate, 
educating not only new generations of mental health professionals, but 
also those in government, the private sector and academia. I, like so 
many others, consider myself fortunate to have been able to learn from 
him, and even more so that I can call him a friend.
  Dr. Marans has dedicated his professional career and much of his 
personal life to researching and developing innovative approaches to 
interventions and treatments that

[[Page E617]]

best meet the needs of children. His work has impacted the lives of 
countless souls and he has been an invaluable resource to communities 
across this country and throughout the globe. His work has changed the 
way we as psychiatrists, as communities, as policy and decision makers, 
and as a society, view and address child trauma. It is a remarkable 
legacy that leaves an indelible mark.
  Today, as he marks the end of his career at the Yale Child Study 
Center, I extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation to Dr. 
Steven Marans for his many years of friendship and support as well as 
my very best wishes in whatever pursuits he takes on. I have no doubt 
that he will continue to make a difference.

                          ____________________

  HONORING SUSAN NEWHART ELLIOTT FOR HER SERVICE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF 
                          DAYTON SCHOOL OF LAW

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. TURNER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor a distinguished 
scholar from my Congressional district who is retiring after 31 years 
of service at the University of Dayton School of Law.
  Susan Newhart Elliott has served as a professor at the School of Law 
since 1994, is Director of the Zimmerman Law Library, and also serves 
as the University of Dayton Law Review faculty advisor. Susan earned 
her law degree from the University of Dayton in 1987, and was the law 
review&#x27;s Managing Editor while she was a student. She has taught 
numerous classes in addition to serving as an Assistant Dean.
  Susan also holds a Bachelor&#x27;s and a Master&#x27;s degree from Miami 
University, as well as a Master&#x27;s in Library and Information Science 
from Kent State University.
  After receiving her law degree, Susan clerked for Judge Walter Rice 
of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio for two 
years before joining the law firm Coolidge, Wall, Womsley &amp; Lombard, 
where she concentrated in complex litigation. She has also been an 
English instructor at Miami University, Xavier University, and Wright 
State University.
  As director of the Zimmerman Law Library, Susan has worked tirelessly 
to make certain that the library supports the school&#x27;s mission of 
providing the highest quality of service to the law faculty and its 
students. This includes overseeing services to all library patrons, 
making sure the necessary books and electronic resources are available 
and accessible, and providing reference service seven days a week with 
a librarian who holds a Master&#x27;s in library science and a law degree.
  Susan has helped train the minds of the law school&#x27;s best and 
brightest students. Graduates have gone on to lead successful lives 
serving their communities as attorneys, judicial clerks, members of 
distinguished law firms, legal counsel in state and federal agencies, 
and on my Congressional staff. Her work has been critical to the law 
school&#x27;s growing reputation, as the University of Dayton School of Law 
is tied for third among Ohio&#x27;s nine law schools according to the most 
recent U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings.
  For nearly 20 years, Susan has served as a reader for the Dayton 
Literary Peace Prize, evaluating nonfiction books submitted for 
consideration by the judges for the award. Inspired by the 1995 Dayton 
Peace Accords that ended the Bosnian War, the Dayton Literary Peace 
Prize is the only literary award in the United States that recognizes 
authors who utilize the power of the written word to promote peace,
  In recognition of Susan&#x27;s longstanding service and contributions to 
the legal profession, an endowment was created in her name to recruit 
legal scholars to write for the University of Dayton Law Review, as 
well as to support the law review in perpetuity.
  Susan Newhart Elliott exemplifies all of the best qualities of a 
teacher, a scholar, and a public servant. She is a credit to her 
profession, and is loved and admired by her students, her colleagues, 
and her friends. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking this truly 
outstanding citizen for her three decades of service to the University 
of Dayton School of Law. I wish her a happy, healthy, and productive 
retirement.

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an 
extraordinary woman, Ms. Louella Avent, as she celebrates her 85th 
birthday. Though her official birthday was May 13, 1940, we joyously 
mark this milestone with a celebration on Saturday, June 7, at the Rose 
Room.
  Born in Oxford, Mississippi, Ms. Avent was raised by dedicated 
farmers. For the past 65 years, Chicago has been her cherished second 
home. A lifelong learner, she graduated high school and continued her 
education at Loop College, now Harold Washington College. Her 
commitment to education continues even now as she embraces ``senior 
life.&#x27;&#x27;

[[Page E615]]

  Ms. Avent`s professional life includes dedicated service to the City 
of Chicago and, most recently, as a greeter at Mark Realty. She&#x27;s also 
certified by the Chicago Greater Food Depository and proudly identifies 
as a chef by trade.
  Throughout her career, she has had the honor of meeting numerous 
political figures, a testament to her widespread connections and 
impact. For Ms. Avent, the proudest moments in her workplace have 
always revolved around ``just being able to help people.&#x27;&#x27; Her guiding 
principle, ``If I can help somebody along the way, then my living will 
not be in vain,&#x27;&#x27; perfectly encapsulates her loving and serving spirit.
  Her dedication extends far beyond her professional roles. Ms. Avent 
is a profound woman of faith, having transitioned from Baptist to 
Pentecostal about 62 years ago. She emphasizes that serving the Lord is 
the core value guiding her life.
  She is a true community worker, participant, and activist, known for 
organizing a multitude of events. Her leadership and keen ability to 
identify needs and act upon them are truly remarkable.
  Ms. Avent has been a lifelong supporter of Operation PUSH, officially 
becoming a member in March 2025. Her commitment to civil rights and 
community empowerment is unwavering. Among her major milestones, she 
fondly recalls meeting the late Mayor Richard Daley, and the esteemed 
Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. and Mrs. Jacqueline Jackson.
  Her journey through 85 years has been marked by both illnesses and 
losses, yet through it all, ``the joy of the Lord has been her 
strength.&#x27;&#x27; She is incredibly proud of her dutiful son, Caesar, an MBA 
graduate, who she credits as a true blessing in her life.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating a 
remarkable individual whose life exemplifies resilience, service, and 
profound love for humanity.

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
remarkable life and profound contributions of Malik Todd Murray, a man 
who embodied the spirit of lifelong learning, athletic excellence, 
financial acumen, activism, mentorship and generous philanthropy rooted 
in faith. His life, marked by exceptional dignity, humility, and class, 
serves as an inspiration to us all.
  Born in Chicago on September 16, 1974, Malik was the firstborn son of 
Cook County Circuit Court Judge Leonard Murray and the late Linda Diane 
Gray Murray. His mother, Linda, dedicated her career to education, 
serving as an assistant principal at Hyde Park Academy following a 
distinguished tenure as an award-winning history, sociology and 
psychology teacher.
  Growing up in Chicago&#x27;s South Shore community, Malik&#x27;s early 
education at St. Philip Neri Elementary School saw him excel both as an 
altar boy and a straight-A student.
  His passion for basketball ignited at the South Shore YMCA Youth 
Basketball Program under the guidance of his father, his first coach.
  This early dedication paved the way for his admission to St. Ignatius 
College Prep where he graduated as the salutorian of his class.
  At St. Ignatius College Prep, Malik&#x27;s athletic talent shone brightly. 
In 1992, his leadership propelled the boys&#x27; basketball team to its 
first Regional Championship in two decades. That same year, he was 
named at the Chicago All Area Team, Chicago Catholic League Player of 
the Year, three-time Chicago Sun-Times Player of the Week and Chicago 
Tribune Athlete of the Week.
  His commitment to excellence in both academics and athletics earned 
him a four-year basketball scholarship to DePaul University, where he 
played under Coach Joey Meyer. Malik secured an internship at the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and then graduated from DePaul&#x27;s Driehaus 
College of Business. Malik spent 8 years at Bank One Brokerage and 
ultimately lead the European shift for international exchange traded 
products. Malik went on to further his education through obtaining an 
MBA in finance from DePaul&#x27;s Kellstadt Graduate School of Business in 
2004.
  In December of 2004, Malik transitioned to Ariel Investments, where 
his talent and dedication led to a distinguished career culminating in 
his role as Senior Vice President, Head of Business Development, 
Institutional Marketing.
  Throughout his career, Malik demonstrated a deep commitment to 
community engagement, serving on the boards of the Chicagoland Chamber 
of Commerce, DePaul University and St. Ignatius College Prep, where he 
established scholarships and funds to promote diversity and inclusion. 
He also held leadership positions with the National Association of 
Securities Professionals (NASP) and contributed to the Ariel Community 
Academy school board.
  His legacy of excellence and generosity will continue to inspire 
future generations.
  At the young age of 50, Malik Todd Murray passed on April 19, 2025. 
He was preceded in death by his mother, Linda Diane Gray Murray. He is 
survived by his longtime partner, Elizabeth; his father, Leonard; his 
sisters, Kai and Nubia (Brian) Davis; his brother, Kamau (Jennifer), 
and a wide circle of friends and family.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing Malik 
Todd Murray as a testament to the power of hard work, integrity, and a 
deep commitment to serving others.

         RECOGNIZING DEPARTING STAFF MEMBER BENJAMIN HONG STARR

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MARK TAKANO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the incredible 
contributions of one of the most dedicated staffers in Congress, 
Benjamin Hong Starr.
  Ben first came to my office as a Victory Institute fellow, before 
joining my staff officially as a staff assistant. Ben not only excelled 
in, but innovated upon, this position--implementing strategies and 
policies that continue to this day. From making constituents feel at 
home to battling the rats in the House Office Building basement, Ben 
proved there was no challenge he could not face.
  Ben&#x27;s unique abilities, professionalism, and dedication are apparent 
to all who across paths him. Throughout the nearly four years Ben was 
in my office he continued to exceed expectations in every role he was 
assigned. As a part of my legislative staff, he continuously found new 
ways to address the needs of California&#x27;s 39th district. From 
spearheading efforts to improve air quality to advancing consumer 
protections, Ben consistently demonstrated the same zealous ingenuity 
that made even the most complex issues seem solvable.
  As Ben moves into his new role with the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus, I could not be prouder of the impact he has already made on 
behalf of the Inland Empire. I, and every person whose life Ben has 
touched, will be watching as he continues helping to create a better 
world.
  I congratulate Ben and thank him for his service.

                          ____________________

  RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND HONOR OF SEAMAN ANGELINA PETRA RESENDIZ

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart 
that I rise today to speak on the tragic and untimely passing of Seaman 
Angelina Petra Resendiz. I wish to honor her for her invaluable service 
to our great country.
  Seaman Resendiz displayed the highest levels of duty and courage in 
the line of duty. Her service is representative of the many brave men 
and women who volunteer to serve their country.
  This exemplary young woman enlisted in August 2023 as a culinary 
specialist in the United States Navy. During this time, she performed 
her duties admirably and to the best of her abilities.
  Unfortunately, Seaman Resendiz was unable to finish her service to 
our country due to her tragic passing. Nobody should ever be targeted 
or harmed by their peers or superiors. We owe an enormous debt to our 
brave service members, and the least we, as Members of Congress, can do 
is ensure that they are protected regardless of gender, ethnicity, or 
where they are stationed.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I wish to honor Seaman 
Resendiz for her service and sacrifice. She was taken from us too soon 
and I stand in solidarity with her family and so many others in their 
pursuit of justice.

                          ____________________

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Memphis&#x27; Interstate 
Bar-B-Que co-founder Barbara Neely who passed on June 16 at the age of 
86. Mrs. Neely started the barbecue restaurant empire in 1979 with her 
husband, Jim, and was its public face, greeting customers from the 
front counter while her husband worked the pits in the kitchen. For 45 
years, she would arrive at the restaurant at 5 a.m. every morning. The 
restaurant they founded became a Memphis institution and a tourist 
attraction, especially after Jim&#x27;s nephew, Patrick, starred in the Food 
Network reality cooking show ``Down Home with the Neelys,&#x27;&#x27; which ran 
from 2008 to 2014. Born Barbara Jean Frison, Barbara went to Manassas 
High School then relocated to New Orleans, where she met Jim, an Air 
Force veteran who left Memphis after high school. The first Interstate 
was founded the year they were married on Christmas Day, 1979, in Las 
Vegas. There are now Neely&#x27;s restaurants at the original South Third 
Street location, on Winchester Road in Memphis, on Stateline Road in 
Southaven, Mississippi and a Memphis-style barbecue restaurant, Jay 
Bee&#x27;s, in Gardena, California. Mrs. Neely put Memphis moist pit 
barbecue and chopped pork sandwiches on the map. I extend my 
condolences to her husband, Jim, her extended family, and her many 
devoted customers. Hers was a life well-lived.

  STENNIS CENTER FOR PUBLIC SERVICE WINTER 2024 PUBLIC SERVICE REVIEW

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY&#x27;&#x27; SCOTT

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my 
colleagues and all Americans to read the recently published Winter 2024 
edition of Public Service Review.
  The Review is a quarterly publication of the Stennis Center for 
Public Service. The Stennis Center is a federal, bipartisan legislative 
branch agency established by the United States Congress to promote 
public service and strengthen the highest ideals of public service in 
America. Established in 1988 in honor of the late Senator John C. 
Stennis of Mississippi, the Stennis Center provides a variety of public 
service programs and development opportunities for young people, 
leaders in local, state, and federal government, and congressional 
staff. In addition to its Starkville, Mississippi, headquarters, the 
Center also has a Washington, D.C. office on Capitol Hill. I am proud 
that several members of my staff, including my Chief of Staff, my Staff 
Director on the Committee on Education and Workforce, and my Education 
Policy Director on the committee have served as Stennis Congressional 
Staff Fellows in the 115th, 117th, and 119th Congresses respectfully.
  The Winter 2024 edition of Public Service Review comes at a pivotal 
moment as we are in the early months of a new Congress and a new 
administration. In this time of transition, elevating the importance of 
public service is critical. The contributors to this edition, including 
senior public servants and participants in the Stennis Program for 
Congressional Interns, reflect on what it means to serve and to lead 
with purpose, integrity, and heart.
  I am proud that this edition includes an interview conducted by 
Meziah Scott, a graduate of Virginia State University, of Michael Maul, 
Director of the Department of Planning and Budget for the Commonwealth 
of Virginia. Their conversation centers on adaptability and 
collaboration in the public sector, with Director Maul emphasizing the 
vital role of mentorship in building a stronger future for government 
leadership.
  This edition includes other student led interviews by Cameron Mayers 
from the University of Mississippi School of Law, Adam Royko from 
Cleveland State University, Zahra Wakilzada from Georgetown University, 
Sydney Aalbers from Texas Tech University, Skylar Kil from Tulane 
University, Vivian Tarbert from Smith College, TaylorAnn Wooley from 
Black Hills State University, Javier Kowalchuk from the University of 
Florida, and Trinity Wilson from Alcorn State University.
  Each of these students should be proud of the work they contributed 
to the Winter 2024 edition of Public Service Review. Their interviews 
of individuals who have devoted their lives to public service reflects 
the heart of this publication and the work of the Stennis Center--the 
belief that public service is enriched by diversity of thought, 
background, and experience.
  Mr. Speaker, again, I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to 
read the latest edition of Public Service Review. The Winter 2024 
edition and previous editions can be accessed online by visiting
