                  ADDRESSING THE CRIMES OF CHILD RAPE

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ANNA PAULINA LUNA

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Mrs. LUNA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the horrific crimes 
of child rape.
  A fundamental principle of justice: the punishment of those who 
commit the most egregious crimes against the innocence of our children. 
It is a matter that strikes at the very core of our values and demands 
our unwavering attention and action.
  There will be those who argue that the death penalty is 
unconstitutional. But let me be unequivocal: when it comes to 
protecting our children from the horrors of child rape, the death 
penalty is not only constitutional, it is a moral imperative.
  Our Constitution stands as a beacon of freedom and justice, crafted 
to safeguard the rights and liberties of every American. Yet, what 
greater violation of those rights could there be than the brutal and 
unforgivable abuse of our most vulnerable--our children? The federal 
minimum for child rape must be upgraded to the death penalty, and a 
minimum of life behind bars. For it is not merely a matter of 
punishment, but of deterrence and justice.
  We must send a resounding message to those who would prey upon our 
children: such heinous crimes will not be tolerated in our society, and 
those who commit them will face the most severe consequences, a life 
for a life. Protecting our children is not just a duty, it is our 
sacred obligation as a Nation. We cannot turn a blind eye to the 
suffering of innocent victims or allow such predators to roam freely 
among us. We must hold these monsters accountable.
  It is our responsibility to ensure that our children are safe from 
harm, and that those who would seek to harm them are swiftly and 
decisively punished. Upgrading the federal minimum for child rape to 
the death penalty is not about vengeance--it is about justice. It is 
about standing up for the most vulnerable members of our society and 
sending a clear message that their safety and well-being are paramount.
  The time has come to reaffirm our commitment to protecting our 
children from harm. Let us stand together, united in our resolve, and 
demand that those who commit such heinous acts face the full force of 
the law.

                          ____________________

 CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF DAVID CHAPEL MISSIONARY BAPTIST 
                                 CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GREG CASAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Mr. CASAR. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the David 
Chapel Missionary Baptist Church&#x27;s celebration of its 100th anniversary 
this year.
  In 1924, 28 African American members founded the Church out of a 
former blacksmith&#x27;s shop in Austin, Texas. David Chapel would move 
twice, landing in its current site at MLK and Chestnut in 1958. Its 
membership continued to expand, and the need for larger accommodations 
became clear. At the height of racial segregation in the American 
South, White-owned banks refused to provide the loans necessary for the 
building of a new space of worship.
  Undeterred, David Chapel pursued the funds, development, and 
construction they needed for the structure, becoming a truly community-
driven project. Additionally, the building was designed by John Chase, 
the first Black graduate of the University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s School 
of Architecture. Through the commitment and dedication of many, the 
construction of the current David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church 
building was finished only a year after it started.
  Since 1992, David Chapel has been led by its Senior Pastor, Rev. 
Joseph C. Parker, Jr., Esq., D. Min. Under Rev. Parker&#x27;s leadership, 
David Chapel has increased its community involvement by developing and 
implementing the Chestnut Neighborhood Plan, and co-founding the Texas 
Congregations United for Empowerment (TCUE), an organization of Black 
churches in Central Texas working to increase their economic and 
community empowerment.
  As the Congressman representing the 35th District of Texas, I am 
honored to congratulate Rev. Packer and David Chapel Missionary Baptist 
Church on its 100th anniversary of providing spiritual guidance and 
serving the needs of our community in East Austin and beyond.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 20th 
anniversary of the Frisco Garden Club&#x27;s Wildflower Luncheon in Frisco, 
Texas.
  In 2002, the City of Frisco established a memorial composed of 
wildflowers in honor of the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks 
on our Nation. In the following year, Frisco Garden Club member Edna 
Willits proposed the addition of a native plant garden and monument at 
the memorial. Through her passionate advocacy and dedication, the 
Freedom Meadow memorial was constructed. In benefit of Freedom Meadow, 
the Club held its first ``Wildflower Tea and Silent Auction&#x27;&#x27; on April 
29, 2004. This successful luncheon yielded the Club over $4,500 and 
allowed Freedom Meadow to expand into the beautiful and moving monument 
it is today.
  Since then, the Club has hosted the Wildflower Luncheon every year to 
raise funds in support of gardens throughout Frisco and conservation 
initiatives for Texas bluebirds. Additionally, the Club has annually 
awarded two high school seniors with scholarships thanks to funds 
raised from this event. I am proud to recognize the Frisco Garden 
Club&#x27;s incredible efforts to support and uplift our community. Their 
important work represents American strength, hope, and resolve against 
those who would harm us.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol in recognition of this historic occasion. I wish the Frisco 
Garden Club and the Wildflower Luncheon continued success for many more 
years to come.

         COMMEMORATING SIXTH BAPTIST CHURCH&#x27;S 100TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of Sixth Baptist Church in Richmond, Virginia.
  In 1923, Reverend Edward D. Caffee led 25 members from Mount Carmel 
Baptist Church to establish a Mission, initially known as St. Luke&#x27;s 
Mission. Despite initial challenges in obtaining recognition, on 
December 12, 1923, the Mission was officially recognized as St. Luke 
Baptist Church.
  Under Reverend Caffee&#x27;s guidance, the church flourished, moving to 
North Sixth Street in 1924, where it held its first service on December 
28, 1924. In November 1927, the Reverend Joseph Arrington was appointed 
as pastor of Sixth Baptist Church. At Arrington&#x27;s recommendation and 
with the congregation&#x27;s consent, the church officially changed its name 
from St. Luke Baptist Church to Sixth Street Baptist Church.
  Despite financial struggles during the Great Depression, the church 
persevered, paying off its mortgage in 1944. In 1952, recognizing the 
changing landscape of Richmond, the congregation moved to the West End, 
renaming itself Sixth Baptist Church. Under the leadership of Reverend 
Arrington, the church&#x27;s membership grew to an astounding 350 members.
  After 33 years of faithful service, Reverend Arrington stepped down 
as pastor, paving the way for the appointment of Haywood Knight as 
Sixth Baptist Church&#x27;s new senior pastor. Under Reverend Knight&#x27;s 
leadership, the church renovated its fellowship hall and established 
the Fellowship Club and Youth Church. Reverend Knight served as pastor 
until 1968, when Reverend Dr. Emmett L. Fleming Sr. became the fourth 
pastor of the church.
  Under Reverend Dr. Fleming&#x27;s tenure, the church embarked on ambitious 
projects, including erecting an educational building and renovating the 
sanctuary. His legacy of community outreach and ministry development 
laid a strong foundation for the future.
  In 2001, Reverend Dr. Yvonne Jones Bibbs became the fifth pastor of 
Sixth Baptist Church, continuing the tradition of stewardship and 
community engagement. As pastor, Rev. Dr. Bibbs has overseen the church 
through two phases of construction and renovations to improve 
facilities and worship spaces for the growing congregation.
  Throughout its 100 years, Sixth Baptist Church has remained a 
steadfast place of worship for congregants and members of the Richmond 
community. As we celebrate Sixth Baptist Church&#x27;s centennial, we honor 
the past, embrace the present, and look forward to a future filled with 
continued growth and service.

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Michael 
Wysocki of Dallas, Texas, and present him with the Congressional 
Patriot Award. Michael is an experienced jurist and courtroom litigator 
who has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community.
  Michael is a distinguished graduate of the University of Texas at 
Tyler and Texas Tech University School of Law. In 2006, he was admitted 
to the State Bar of Texas and became board-certified in Family Law in 
2011. Michael is licensed to practice law in Texas, New Mexico, and 
before the U.S. Supreme Court. He became the Managing Shareholder of 
O&#x27;Neil Wysocki, P.C., with offices in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston. 
Over the years, Michael has successfully represented many clients who 
are experiencing family and domestic legal issues.
  For his extensive work and efforts, Michael was named a Texas Rising 
Star lawyer three times and recognized as a Texas Super Lawyer since 
2014, a prestigious title awarded to less than five percent of all 
lawyers statewide. Additionally, he has been honored by the Annette 
Stewart Family Law Inns of Court for his professionalism. In his free 
time, Michael volunteers on political campaigns to elect Republican 
candidates and helps appoint qualified Judges throughout Texas. Whether 
he is in the courtroom or on the campaign trail, Michael is a fierce 
fighter and advocate for American values.
  It is an honor to bestow Michael with the Patriot Award for his 
exceptional service to our Nation and the people of North Texas. I wish 
him continued success for many years to come.

 HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF REVEREND DR. TOMMIE L. LEWIS AS PASTOR OF 
              BETHEL MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH PRATT CITY

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Ms. SEWELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary 
career of a faithful servant leader, Reverend Dr. Tommie L. Lewis, as 
he celebrates his retirement as senior pastor of Bethel Missionary 
Baptist Church Pratt City after 42 years of service to the Birmingham 
community.
  Pastor T.L. Lewis answered the call to ministry on January 6, 1973, 
becoming licensed to preach at the Shady Grove Missionary Baptist 
Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and was ordained by incumbent Reverend 
G.W. Sloan on July 29, 1973.
  Pastor Lewis is an accomplished biblical scholar. He attended the 
Birmingham Easonian Baptist Bible College, earning a Bachelor of Arts 
and a Bachelor of Theology before earning a Master of Divinity degree 
at Universal Bible Institute in Brunswick, Georgia. Pastor Lewis 
received two honorary doctoral degrees from both his alma maters for 
his contributions to ministry through his public service.
  Pastor Lewis accepted his first pastoral assignment at the First 
Baptist Church Carver in Bessemer, Alabama. He then served at the 
Antioch Baptist Church in Gadsden, Alabama. In 1982, Pastor Lewis was 
commissioned to his final home in Birmingham as head pastor of Bethel 
Baptist Church Pratt City, where he has remained for the past 42 years 
of his career.
  During his tenure, Pastor Lewis has served ``Bethel Nation,&#x27;&#x27; well, 
expanding its congregation to thousands and positioning the church to 
its status as a beacon of hope in the Pratt City community. Pastor 
Lewis&#x27; legacy has been fueled by his servant&#x27;s heart, commitment to 
community, and passion for improving the lives of others. His position 
as a powerful force for good extends far beyond the sanctuary walls.
  Pastor Lewis has dedicated his life to building a coalition of 
community servants that will far outlast him. His tutelage led to 
fifty-three

[[Page E337]]

others heeding the call to ministry that Pastor Lewis himself answered 
fifty-two years ago. In 1990, the Bethel Baptist Church erected a new 
Worship Center, including a sanctuary with a seating capacity of 1800, 
an office plaza, a conference room, a library, and a nursery. Pastor 
Lewis worked to expand Bethel&#x27;s community service by commissioning a 
new Family Life Center. This building also became a permanent home for 
the Bethel Community Learning Center, which garnered thousands of state 
and federal dollars to support community development and education 
initiatives.
  Tragically, in April of 2011, these buildings were destroyed by a 
devastating tornado. In the face of adversity, Pastor Lewis did not 
hesitate to spring into action, leaning on his faith to rally his 
community together and restore their church home. He then established 
the Bethel Emergency Management Agency, which led the restoration and 
revitalization efforts of Bethel Baptist Church Pratt City and the 
surrounding community. Pastor Lewis facilitated the construction of a 
new sanctuary beginning in April 2012, and the new home of Bethel 
Nation was completed and consecrated on August 24, 2014.
  In addition to his leadership in Birmingham, Pastor Lewis has also 
been the guiding force behind international missions, spreading his 
spiritual teachings across the globe. He has delivered sermons on 
different continents throughout the world. No matter how far his 
ministry has taken him, Pastor Lewis has always remained committed to 
home. He has displayed his commitment to public service through his 
leadership and religious affiliations, which include the Pratt City 
Ministerial Alliance, the Birmingham Metropolitan Baptist Ministerial 
Conference, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
  Beyond his work in the clergy, Pastor Lewis&#x27; civic affiliations 
include former Captain for the Bessemer Police and Fire Department 
Chaplaincy Corps, Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Jefferson 
County Transit Authority, Chairman of the Board of Directors for the 
Jefferson County Commission of Economic Opportunity, and State 
President for the National Rainbow Push Coalition. Pastor Lewis was 
honored by the Magic City in 1988 with his induction into the City of 
Birmingham&#x27;s Gallery of Distinguished Citizens--a bust of him is 
displayed in the Birmingham City Hall to commemorate this achievement.
  On a personal note, Pastor T.L. Lewis holds a special place in my 
heart as a dear friend and trusted spiritual advisor. I was honored to 
host Pastor Lewis at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., 
as one of the first pastors in our district to attend. I know I can 
always count on his wise words and counsel when I need inspiration. 
Pastor Lewis&#x27; mentorship has meant so much to me over the years and has 
positively impacted me as a public servant. After the devastating 
storms of 2011, Pastor Lewis&#x27; leadership and faith were a beacon of 
hope for me and so many others as we rebuilt. His deep love for his 
community renews my passion for public service and reminds me of why I 
am in Washington. I am proud to congratulate him for his 42 years of 
service to the Bethel Baptist Church Pratt City congregation and 
surrounding community. Though he is retiring, I know his service will 
not end here, and I wish him the best in his future endeavors.
  On behalf of Alabama&#x27;s 7th Congressional District, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing the extraordinary leadership and 
exemplary service of Reverend Dr. T.L. Lewis and his contributions to 
the Birmingham community and the State of Alabama as the senior pastor 
of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church Pratt City.

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record a 
statement from Josselyn Wolf, a young woman from Rhode Island, who 
appears with me in the documentary film ``Wild Beauty: Mustang Spirit 
of the West&#x27;&#x27; about the plight of America&#x27;s wild horses. She is an 
advocate for H.R. 3656, the Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act, of 
which I am an original cosponsor, and has some insightful thoughts to 
share about how the Wild Horse and Burro Program is being run by the 
Bureau of Land Management. This is her statement:
       ``We need the tonic of wildness.&#x27;&#x27; This powerful sentiment, 
     articulated by Henry David Thoreau in his reflective piece 
     Walden, was embodied when millions of children sent letters 
     to Congress--more letters than any non-war-related movement 
     has generated in American history--begging for the protection 
     of one of our nation&#x27;s most treasured species: the wild 
     horse.
       Harnessing the power of our democratic republic, these 
     voices inspired the unanimous passage of the 1971 Wild Free-
     Roaming Horses and Burros Act. The Act reserved roughly 47 
     million acres of Western rangelands for the unbridled 
     existence of wild horses and burros and promised the 
     dwindling numbers of mustangs--then at extinction level--
     protection from ``capture, branding, harassment, or death.&#x27;&#x27;
       Over fifty years since the passage of that vital 
     legislation, half of designated herd management areas have 
     been eliminated and the protections promised by the Act 
     continue to be grossly and sometimes violently violated under 
     a system that misleads and misinforms Congress, the media, 
     and the American people.
       Each year, Congress allocates over one hundred million 
     dollars to the Bureau of Land Management to support the Wild 
     Horse and Burro Program: a system that endangers, kills, 
     incarcerates, and separates close-knit equine families 
     through the use of traumatic helicopter-induced stampedes and 
     dismal holding facilities, a system overseen by land managers 
     who claim to restore the land while destroying it, a system 
     that has sent thousands of wild horses--wild horses: the 
     icons of freedom and grit that define our great nation--to 
     the slaughter pipeline.
       Why? To support millions of livestock who produce less than 
     two percent of American beef, much of which is shipped 
     overseas to China. Livestock who, by the Bureau of Land 
     Management&#x27;s own statistics, graze nearly six times more 
     public land than wild horses, vastly outnumbering them on 
     their own designated territories. Not only does public 
     grazing of cattle and sheep degrade biodiversity, it also 
     subsidizes billion-dollar cattle corporations at the expense 
     of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars: a stark contrast 
     to small ranchers who are forced to pay rising grazing fees.
       As human beings, we wield unprecedented power to disrupt 
     the thriving natural ecological balance of our planet and 
     therefore unprecedented responsibility to sustain it. As the 
     National Academy of Sciences along with a multitude of 
     independent scientists and researchers have attested, our 
     land&#x27;s ecological harmony is, in its current state, 
     fundamentally broken. As law scholars have passionately 
     voiced, our legal compliance with the Wild Free-Roaming 
     Horses and Burros Act is fundamentally broken. As Indigenous 
     representatives have testified, our relationship with the 
     land is fundamentally broken.
       You, Members of Congress, wield the power to defend this 
     untamed wildness that is the history and heart of America 
     before it reaches extinction level. Each of you, Members of 
     Congress, are in a unique position to rectify this 
     dysfunctional system that is compromising our environment, 
     our economy, and the natural wonders and gifts we are 
     collectively responsible for, to pass down to our children 
     untarnished and undestroyed.
       Therefore, I am not asking for a radical, partisan rewrite: 
     I am asking for a conversation. It is up to you to reevaluate 
     the priorities of our nation . . . before it&#x27;s too late. As a 
     sixteen-year-old constituent, it is of imperative importance 
     to me that the planet of my future is managed sustainably, 
     and that carelessness does not forever eliminate the tonic of 
     wildness that makes our Earth a home.

                          ____________________

  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elaina Murphy for her 
service to Kentucky&#x27;s Second District. A Nicholasville, Kentucky 
native, Elaina obtained her Bachelors Degree from Centre College in 
2015 and her Masters Degree from George Washington University in 2017.
  Nearly a decade ago, I welcomed Elaina to my team as a summer intern 
in July 2015 before she transitioned to become my Staff Assistant until 
December 2015. In August 2016, I welcomed her back to my office as my 
Legislative Correspondent. She has since advanced to roles as 
Legislative Assistant, Senior Legislative Assistant, and most recently 
Senior Policy Advisor. Elaina has worked tirelessly in nearly every 
legislative area in my office with particular interests in foreign 
affairs, energy, and telecommunications. She has been essential to many 
projects in my office, including spearheading the Spectrum Caucus, and 
has been a passionate advocate for America&#x27;s gold standard military 
installation, Fort Knox.
  I want to thank Elaina for her work serving her home state and 
Kentucky&#x27;s Second District as a constant, reliable member of my team. I 
wish her the best as she excels in this next chapter of her career on 
Capitol Hill expanding her work in foreign affairs as she goes to work 
for the House Intelligence Committee.

  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kim Huston on her 
retirement from nearly 30 years of working in local economic 
development in Nelson County.
  As President of the Nelson County Economic Development Agency and 
Bardstown Industrial Development Corporation, Kim has been a tireless 
advocate for Nelson County and ensuring their economic success. During 
her time in economic development she has overseen more than 
$1,500,000,000 in investments in her area and made sure Nelson County 
had a seat at the table in a global economy by building relationships 
with business leaders worldwide.
  Kim has been a champion for making Nelson County a global tourist 
destination. Alongside keeping Bardstown the Bourbon Capital of the 
World, she oversaw the city being named the most Beautiful Small Town 
in America by USA Today and Rand McNally in 2012. Her passion for 
Nelson County is felt by everyone who has met her and she captured that 
passion by proudly authoring three books about her hometown.
  I want to thank Kim for her work in Nelson County and wish her a 
happy retirement as she spends more time with her family.

  Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Professor 
Marielaine Mammon as she is honored as a recipient of the 2024 Dale P. 
Parnell Distinguished Faculty Award. This national award recognizes 
exemplary faculty members from America&#x27;s community colleges. Through 
her decades of service to the County College of Morris (CCM) in New 
Jersey&#x27;s Eleventh Congressional District, Professor Mammon continues to 
inspire classes of students.
  Professor Mammon dedicated her education and career to the performing 
arts. Of her 51 years of teaching experience, she dedicated 47 years to 
CCM and has made a lasting impact on our community. Professor Mammon is 
a tremendous mentor and she inspires her students to see their full 
potential while honing the skills needed to reach their goals. Through 
her extraordinary career in the performing arts, including performances 
at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center&#x27;s Alice Tully Hall, Professor 
Mammon leads her students by example.
  Outside of the classroom, Professor Mammon is deeply involved on 
campus, whether she is chairing Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations, 
leading choir performances at local senior living facilities, or 
creating interdisciplinary opportunities for students. She has served 
on numerous committees, including the Pandemic Response Team, Academic 
Standards Committee, and Curriculum Committee. Through these 
extracurricular efforts, Professor Mammon hears directly from both 
students and faculty on their needs on campus and she brings this 
understanding to her work.
  I am honored to recognize Professor Mammon for her exemplary career 
and congratulate her on this well-deserved recognition.

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to Join the Sacramento 
Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce in recognition of the 2023 Al Geiger 
Memorial Award Honoree, West Sacramento City Council Member Quirina 
Orozco, for her ongoing exemplary public service to the Sacramento 
region. Council Member Orozco is an excellent leader in our community 
who demonstrates that the Sacramento region&#x27;s approach to everything 
from economic development, innovation, community outreach, and advocacy 
can and should be a model for the rest of the country. Council Member 
Orozco&#x27;s commitment to public service illustrates the very reason why I 
love my congressional district. Our leaders have always sought to 
innovate, to push the envelope, and--most importantly--to deliver for 
out constituents.

[[Page E336]]

  Even before her time in elected office, Council Member Orozco had 
demonstrated a commitment to public service, serving in the White House 
while crafting federal education policy and later as an advisor to then 
Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante on tribal community and veteran issues. To 
this day, Council Member Orozco continues her service to the public as 
a prosecutor for the Sacramento County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, with 
a focus on sexual assault and child abuse cases. Council Member 
Orozco&#x27;s commitment to our community has been an ongoing facet of her 
life--a commitment that the West Sacramento community is both grateful 
for and counting on.
  As a member of the West Sacramento City Council, Council Member 
Orozco has continued to champion the West Sacramento chapter of the 
Downtown Streets Team to create opportunities for unhoused individuals 
who are seeking to break out of the cycle of recurring systemic trauma 
and incarceration. Council Member Orozco&#x27;s support was critical for the 
West Sacramento Home Run program, which provides community members with 
access to high-quality early learning for young children, college 
savings accounts, and internships. Council Member Orozco&#x27;s service 
continues to demonstrate how diligent and focused advocacy can create 
real change in our communities.
  Mr. Speaker, today we honor West Sacramento City Council Member 
Quirina Orozco for her extraordinary service to the City of West 
Sacramento and the Greater Sacramento Region for many more years to 
come.

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, April 11, 2024

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Stan Lyford&#x27;s more 
than fifty years of outstanding contributions to the Portsmouth High 
School Track Program. Since 1975, Stan has been a committed coach and 
mentor for the Portsmouth High School girls track and cross-country 
teams where he works to motivate his athletes to succeed not just on 
the track, but also in their academic and personal lives. With a 
lifelong passion for giving back to his community and ensuring that 
every student can succeed, Stan embodies the value of service above 
self and has had an immeasurable effect on strengthening the Portsmouth 
community.
  In addition to his profound impact on the Portsmouth High School 
Track Program, Stan was also a math teacher at Portsmouth High School 
where he worked to engage with students and equip them to reach their 
highest academic potential. Although he retired from teaching in 2007, 
his continued role as head coach showcases his lifelong commitment to 
his students.
  On behalf of New Hampshire&#x27;s First District, I commend Stan for 
reaching this remarkable fifty-year milestone in his continued service 
to his community. The amount of trust placed in Stan for over half a 
century is a testament to his efficacy and compassion as a teacher, 
coach, and leader. I look forward to seeing what he will continue to 
achieve as he carries
