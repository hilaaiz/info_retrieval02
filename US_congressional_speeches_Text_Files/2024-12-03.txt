          COMMEMORATING THE INVESTITURE OF DR. HARRISON KELLER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. PAT FALLON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the investiture 
of Dr. Harrison Keller, Ph.D., as the 17th president of the University 
of North Texas.
  Dr. Keller received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of 
Notre Dame and earned a master&#x27;s degree and Ph.D. in philosophy from 
Georgetown University. He began his career as a legislative aide in the 
Texas House of Representatives and Senate before becoming Director of 
Research and Senior Education Advisor. Dr. Keller also taught courses 
at the University of Texas at Austin, Georgetown, and St. Edward&#x27;s 
University. He later served as the Deputy to the President for Strategy 
and Policy at UT Austin as well as Vice Provost for Higher Education 
Policy and Research and Executive Director of the Center for Teaching 
and Learning. In this role, Dr. Keller developed several educational 
initiatives, including OnRamps, to provide high school students with 
the opportunity to earn college credit to UT Austin at low cost.
  Prior to arriving at UNT, Dr. Keller served as Commissioner of Higher 
Education and chief executive officer of the Texas Higher Education 
Coordinating Board. Under his outstanding leadership, the Board 
advocated for policies and programs to help low-income and first-
generation college students be successful. Moreover, Dr. Keller worked 
with state legislators to improve access to financial aid and workforce 
education. His tenure as commissioner allowed Texas to lead nationwide 
in higher education and university research. I am pleased to recognize 
Dr. Keller today for his dedication to student success and commitment 
to strengthening UNT&#x27;s status as a Tier One Research University.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol in recognition of this historic occasion. Congratulations to 
Dr. Keller, and I wish him the very best.

                     CONGRATULATING MICHELLE BAKER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GREG LOPEZ

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. LOPEZ. Mr. Speaker, Colorado high school women&#x27;s volleyball coach 
Michelle Baker was recently awarded the Horizon Award from the Colorado 
High School Athletics Association. This award is presented to Michelle 
for the significant improvements to Wiggins High School&#x27;s volleyball 
program she has brought about over the past few years. Her dedication 
to her team and the women&#x27;s volleyball program at Wiggins High is an 
inspiration to all.
  Every student deserves the opportunity to compete in sports. Coaches 
like Michelle make that possible by coaching their players towards 
success on and off the court, teaching them skills like discipline, 
teamwork, and work ethic that will benefit them for years to come.
  It is my distinct privilege as the United States Representative of 
the 4th District of Colorado, to congratulate Michelle for her hard 
work in achieving this award, and for improving Wiggins High School&#x27;s 
women&#x27;s volleyball team. Her dedication to the development of Colorado 
athletics cannot be understated, and I encourage Michelle to continue 
cultivating the best women&#x27;s volleyball program at Wiggins High for the 
betterment of her players and the school at large.

                          ____________________

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LaMALFA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a good friend, Sean 
Morgan, who has served on the Chico City Council for the last 12 years. 
Like our American founders, he stepped up to serve and is returning 
back to private life. He has done an outstanding job for the City of 
Chico and must be recognized for his efforts.
  Sean moved to Chico in 1974 at age 4. He attended Citrus and Shasta 
Elementary Schools, Bidwell Jr. High, and Chico High. In 1993 Sean 
graduated from the Chico State College of Business.
  While raising his two boys, Ashton and Zachary, Sean was involved in 
local youth sports for over a decade as a coach, referee, and team 
parent. Sean&#x27;s favorite time of year is any day he can watch his own 
children participating in any activities.
  Sean Morgan started his first company while still attending college 
and was traveling around the country speaking on the small business 
lecture circuit at age 25. It was here that he learned the value of 
budgets, living within one&#x27;s means, and managing diverse groups of 
people. In addition to being a business owner, Sean teaches business at 
Chico State University.
  In 2012, he was elected as a Chico City Council member and has served 
multiple roles during his twelve years on the council. Sean&#x27;s intent as 
a council member was clear, to return Chico to a safe place to raise a 
family, an ideal location for business, and a premier place to live. 
Sean served as Vice Mayor for two years and then Mayor for two years. 
He served on the Finance Committee for ten years, serving as the Chair 
for eight of those ten years.
  During his twelve years of service on the council, Sean was a strong 
defender of public safety, the rights of business owners, and the 
citizens. Sean has been a strong leader through numerous disasters, 
including the Oroville Dam Crisis, the Paradise Camp Fire, and the 
COVID pandemic, and fighting to clean up the City of Chico after a 
lopsided council created a homeless crisis and needle giveaway 
programs.
  On a personal note, for more than 12 years now Sean has been Mr. 
Chico. He has been the Master of Ceremonies for more events than I can 
count, including many of mine. He has raised money, he has volunteered, 
he has been the loudest, most consistent voice for common sense in 
difficult times. Sean Morgan has sacrificed for the City of Chico. If 
there was something that needed to be done, Sean is who we all counted 
on to get it done.
  The City, the County and I are grateful for his years of service and 
commitment to the City of Chico. With sincere appreciation I am happy 
to honor Sean Morgan for his extraordinary service and commitment. I 
thank Sean Morgan.

                                 ______

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. FINSTAD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of 
Minnesota House Representative John Petersburg. First elected in 2012 
to represent District 24A, Representative Petersburg has served the 
people of Minnesota honorably in the State House for the past twelve 
years.
  John grew up on a farm and has exemplified a profound willingness to 
serve throughout his career. Many know him to be a dedicated father and 
husband, as well as a respected leader in his community.
  The priorities of the people of Waseca and Steele counties have 
always been at the forefront of Representative Petersburg&#x27;s service in 
the Legislature, particularly through his continued leadership in the 
many House committees on which he has served throughout the years.
  Representative Petersburg has done an exemplary job of leading on 
issues--most notably, his instrumental work on the completion of the 
historic U.S. Highway 14 corridor between New Ulm and Rochester.
  All of us across southern Minnesota have been wellserved by 
Representative Petersburg&#x27;s time in office, and I wish him the warmest 
congratulations on his retirement.

                HONORING RABBI IRVING ``YITZ&#x27;&#x27; GREENBERG

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RITCHIE TORRES

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Irving ``Yitz&#x27;&#x27; Greenberg, 
a visionary scholar, teacher, author, and lecturer whose career 
spanning more than 65 years has profoundly influenced Jewish thought 
and practice while relating deeply to universal human values. His 
pioneering work, grounded in the core value of choosing life and 
improving society through goodness in every action, carries insights 
that resonate far beyond any single religion or tradition.
  Rabbi Greenberg envisions a future shaped by a profound reverence for 
life in all its forms, inspiring us to build a more unified, 
compassionate, and humane world. Central to this vision is the 
traditional Jewish belief in Tzelem Elokim--the conviction that all 
humans are created in the image of God, underscoring the inherent 
dignity and worth of every person.
  Rabbi Greenberg&#x27;s contributions extend far beyond ideas and 
scholarship to the institutions he has created and shaped, institutions 
that continue to embody his vision, often challenging traditional norms 
to inspire growth and progress. As leader of the Soviet Jewry movement, 
rabbi of a Modern Orthodox synagogue in Riverdale, and co-founder of 
SAR academy, a day school in my district of the Bronx, Rabbi Greenberg 
has served the Jewish community in numerous capacities. He has been a 
professor and chair of the Jewish Studies Department at City College of 
New York, president of CLAL and the Jewish Life Network/Steinhardt 
Foundation, and executive director of the President&#x27;s Commission on the 
Holocaust. His leadership extended to chairing the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum. In fact, Rabbi Greenberg was among the first to teach 
college-level courses on the Holocaust in the mid-1960s.
  As a Modern Orthodox philosopher, Rabbi Greenberg has addressed the 
profound challenges posed by the Holocaust, framing it as a 
transformative moment that altered the relationship between man and 
God, and shattered the Jewish world, one that had to rebuild itself and 
create a new, life-affirming reality. His narrative of Jewish life in a 
post-Holocaust

[[Page E1206]]

world emphasizes resilience, responsibility, and the power of moral 
action. He described this period as the ``Third Great Era&#x27;&#x27; in Jewish 
history--an era marked by Jewish self-determination. This era would be 
defined by Jews taking full responsibility for their own destiny, from 
the establishment of the State of Israel to the creation of new 
Diaspora institutions that would celebrate and sustain the full 
spectrum of Jewish religiuos and ethnic identity. Now, at 91, Rabbi 
Greenberg explores this core principle of Tzelem Elokim in ``The 
Triumph of Life: A Narrative Theology of Judaism&#x27;&#x27;, a profound magnum 
opus that encapsulates the breadth of his teachings. Greenberg&#x27;s vision 
emphasizes justice, compassion, and dignity, with the sanctity of life 
and the divine image inherent in every human being at its heart.
  Throughout his career, Rabbi Greenberg has remained steadfast in his 
commitment to these values, in partnership with his wife, Blu, a 
trailblazing writer and founder of the Orthodox feminist movement. 
Together, Rabbi Yitz and Blu Greenberg&#x27;s progressive values have been 
central to the educational philosophy of SAR Academy, the school they 
founded in Riverdale, NY. Inspired by the Open Education movement, they 
envisioned a school with no walls, one that would foster creativity, 
independence, and collaboration through open spaces and a student-
centered approach--a vision in this deep belief in the divine potential 
inherent in every individual. Today, more than fifty-six years later, 
SAR continues to embody Rabbi Greenberg&#x27;s vision, recognizing the 
divine spark in each and every individual child. The school challenges 
students to live Torah values while fostering creativity, empathy, and 
a commitment to building a better world.
  Rabbi Greenberg has remained steadfast in his mission to advance 
Judaism as dynamic, inclusive, and responsive to the challenges of the 
modern world. He has consistently advocated for the inclusion of women 
and LGBTQ individuals in religious life, while also championing 
interfaith dialogue as essential to fostering compassion and 
understanding across communities.
  In these dark and challenging times, Rabbi Greenberg&#x27;s message serves 
as a beacon of hope. His teachings remind us of the transformative 
power of goodness and respect for every individual in shaping a 
brighter future for all.

  HONORING THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE REO MOTOR CAR 
                                COMPANY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I honor the 120th anniversary of the 
founding of the REO Motor Car Company, a pioneer in American automotive 
history founded by Ransom E. Olds. Established in 1904 in Lansing, 
Michigan, REO played a foundational role in shaping both the automotive 
industry and the city of Lansing. Throughout its years in operation, 
REO Motor Car Company stood as a symbol of innovation, producing 
vehicles that helped define an era in American transportation.
  REO Motor Car Company had a profound effect on Lansing. By the 1920s, 
REO employed 10 percent of the city&#x27;s population, underscoring the 
company&#x27;s importance not only as a major employer but as a pillar of 
the community. The REO Clubhouse, built in 1917, served as a social 
center for employees and their families, hosting weddings, patriotic 
events during World War I and II, and even Lansing&#x27;s first radio 
station. Through its commitment to its workforce and the community, REO 
helped shape Lansing&#x27;s identity as a manufacturing hub.
  Among REO Motor Car Company&#x27;s most celebrated vehicles were the REO 
Speed Wagon, the Flying Cloud, and the Royale. Introduced in 1915, the 
REO Speed Wagon set a new standard for trucks with its speed and 
durability, paving the way for the modern pickup truck. The Flying 
Cloud, launched in 1927, was known for its advanced hydraulic brakes, 
which set a new benchmark in automotive safety. The 1931 REO Royale 
featured a streamlined design that made it a true trendsetter in 
American car design.
  Although REO ceased car production in 1936 to focus exclusively on 
truck manufacturing, the company remained a force in the industry. 
During World War II, REO Motor Car Company contributed to the war 
effort, supplying trucks to U.S. allies in a time of great need. REO 
continued to produce trucks until 1975, ending more than 70 years of 
innovation and service in the automotive industry.
  Today, the legacy of REO Motor Car Company is preserved by the R.E. 
Olds Transportation Museum in Lansing. The museum stands as a tribute 
to both the company and its visionary founder, Ransom E. Olds, 
displaying a collection of rare and historic vehicles that allow 
visitors to appreciate the craftsmanship and ingenuity that defined 
REO.

[[Page E1207]]

Through these exhibits, the museum ensures that the company&#x27;s 
contributions to the auto industry are remembered and celebrated.
  As we recognize the 120th anniversary of the REO Motor Car Company&#x27;s 
founding, let us acknowledge not only the vehicles it produced but also 
its impact on the city of Lansing and generations of residents. It is 
with great respect that I honor the REO Motor Car Company here in the 
United States House of Representatives.

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my sadness at the 
devastating news that Long Island native Omer Neutra, 21, was among the 
47 Americans slaughtered by Hamas during the brutal October 7th 
massacre. Growing up on Long Island, Omer was a cherished and active 
member of his community at the Schechter School of Long Island, Midway 
Jewish Center, and as a participant in Jewish youth summer programs. 
Those who knew Omer will miss his magnetic, fun-loving personality and 
joyful spirit. My heart is with Omer&#x27;s parents, Ronen and Orna, and his 
brother, Daniel, who have fought tirelessly to bring Omer home. May 
Omer&#x27;s memory be a blessing.

                              ELLIOTT, JR.

                                 ______

                             of mississippi

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember a 
Mississippian whose infectious personality and energetic spirit will 
always be remembered by those who knew him. James ``Jim&#x27;&#x27; William 
Elliott, Jr. from Brookhaven, Mississippi, lived the embodiment of the 
American Dream. He loved God, family, and cheering for his favorite 
sports teams: the Ole Miss Rebels, New Orleans Saints, and Atlanta 
Braves. Jim was generous with his time and found his greatest joy in 
connecting with others. No matter how busy life was, Jim was there to 
lend a listening ear and take time to enjoy family.
  Born in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1931, Jim graduated from Central 
High School in 1949. After graduation, he attended the University of 
Mississippi where he excelled in academics and extracurricular 
activities. He was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order, president of the 
Cardinal Club, president of the School of Liberal Arts, and a Cadet 
Colonel of the Air R.O.T.C.
  Jim served his country for two years in the United States Air Force 
as 1st Lieutenant and a legal officer. His time in the Air Force taught 
him the value of serving his country and what it means to uphold life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Jim attended law school at the 
University of Mississippi and obtained his LLB degree. His academic 
achievements earned him president of his senior class while in law 
school, and his job as assistant to the Business Manager of Athletics 
encouraged his love of sports.
  As an outdoorsman, Jim took his love for sports to the field. From 
hunting and fishing to playing tennis, Jim enjoyed all sorts of sports. 
Of all the sports, Jim loved tennis best. He was known across 
Brookhaven for his willingness to teach young students how to play 
tennis. His children and grandchildren also received hands-on 
instruction from Jim on the sport. As a hunter, Jim received the Ducks 
Unlimited Award in 1987 for his contributions to waterfowl 
conservation.
  The great outdoors gave Jim a deep love for the Lord and his 
creation. Jim was an active member of Faith Presbyterian Church in 
Brookhaven. While a member, he jumped at opportunities to serve and 
give back to the Lord. He served as a deacon, chairman of the 
deaconate, Sunday school teacher, president of the Men of the church, 
and served as an advisor to the Senior High Fellowship. The time he 
spent both outside and in service to the church was with deep purpose 
and conviction.
  Jim was a devoted family man who loved God above all. His legacy of 
service will live on throughout the communities that he impacted. He 
never shied away from meeting with people and setting an example of how 
to love others well. Jim was always generous with his time and presence 
to those who knew him. I know that he is missed by his family and 
community. I am honored for a chance to remember a lifelong 
Mississippian who loved his community and invested in those around him. 
I hope people across the Third District of Mississippi will see the 
value in serving the community around them as Jim did. I am thankful to 
serve a district that is home to people like James ``Jim&#x27;&#x27; William 
Elliott, Jr.

   RECOGNIZING DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, ABIGAIL FUCHS FOR HER 
  EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA&#x27;S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEAN PHILLIPS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Deputy 
Communications Director, Abigail Fuchs, for her work on behalf of every 
constituent in Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District. I could not be 
more proud or grateful for her service.
  Abbey grew up in Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District in the 
suburbs of Minneapolis (Maple Grove and Edina, Minnesota). After 
graduating from Edina High School, she went on to attend the University 
of St. Thomas where she played on the Women&#x27;s Soccer Team, ran track, 
and graduated with a degree in marketing. Abbey worked in campaign 
finance right out of college and then transitioned to my office in 2021 
where she began as a Legislative Correspondent, was promoted to 
Constituent Communications Specialist, and finally held the title of 
Deputy Communications Director. Abbey is a team player at work and in 
her personal life, where she uses her athletic and leadership skills to 
inspire the next generation as a youth soccer coach.
  Like my grandmother, the legendary advice columnist Dear Abby, I 
believe in the transformative power of listening. I often say that 
representation itself begins with listening, which is why I am so 
grateful that our own ``Dear Abbey&#x27;&#x27; has lent her considerable talents 
to me--and our entire community--for the past three years. Abbey 
upholds the very foundation of our democracy by ensuring every 
Minnesotan who has an idea, question, or criticism to share is treated 
with compassion, receives a response, and is invited to continue a 
thoughtful dialogue with my office--no matter their politics.
  Abbey embodies the spirit of radical hospitality, is quick to 
internalize and act upon strategy, and has capably forged a new path in 
congressional communications. Abbey creatively transformed our email 
and mass communications program into a branding superpower and is the 
only communications professional we know to have received unprovoked 
thanks from constituents on the receiving end of mass emails--high 
praise in the age of digital spam. Her innovative approach to 
congressional communications has been identified by the Chief 
Administrative Officer of the House as best-in-class and helped propel 
me to a leadership position on the House Democratic Policy and 
Communications Committee in 2022.
  In addition to her outstanding work products, Abbey is a thoughtful 
and supportive teammate--always willing to lend a hand when needs 
arise. She is bright, energetic, and always looking outside the box to 
accomplish the goals of the office. Abbey brings optimism and a can-do 
attitude to whatever projects she is a part of.
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed. I 
wish Abbey all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for 
almost four years of faithful service to this Nation in my office.

RECOGNIZING DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY, TAYLOR MILLS, FOR HER EXCELLENT WORK 
         ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA&#x27;S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DEAN PHILLIPS

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Director of 
Advocacy, Taylor Mills, for her work on behalf of every constituent in 
Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District. I am thrilled that the end of 
my time in Congress will not be the end of Taylor&#x27;s service to the 
district, as she will now become the District Director for my 
successor, Congresswoman-Elect Kelly Morrison, and I could not be more 
proud or grateful for her service.
  Born and raised in Minnesota, Taylor earned a double major in 
Political Science and Justice and Peace Studies with a concentration in 
public policy analysis and advocacy from St. Catherine University and 
the University of St. Thomas. After college, she was offered the job of 
a lifetime in the Office of Governor Mark Dayton and (then) Lieutenant 
Governor Tina Smith. Her passion for constituent services and community 
engagement were fostered there until Governor Dayton&#x27;s retirement. In 
early March of 2020, she was called upon to return to the Governor&#x27;s 
Office, as the Director of Constituent Services and Public Engagement 
for Governor Tim Walz and Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan. While 
there, she helped lead the team through multiple crisis situations 
including: COVID-19, the murders of George Floyd and Daunte Wright, and 
unprecedented numbers of constituent correspondence, casework, and 
community feedback. Transitioning from State Government to Federal, 
Taylor has brought a wealth of experience with her as she continues to 
build bridges in my office as the Director of Advocacy.
  Taylor is a seasoned professional with sound judgement, and her broad 
experience has proven invaluable. She is a problem solver and creative 
thinker--eager to rethink systems and processes that are no longer 
serving their purposes. Taylor is a thoughtful and caring manager who 
invests her time helping her team grow professionally while also 
getting to know them personally.
  Taylor is a fierce defender of the first amendment and capably 
coached my team members through moments of protest and celebration. 
Taylor is a natural in the community, building productive relationships 
and holding space for diverging viewpoints. Her approach to getting to 
the heart of the matter is most admirable as she does so in a gentle 
yet determined way. Taylor is Radical Hospitality in action--when you 
talk to her, you have her full attention. Taylor&#x27;s bright spirit and 
warmth was a welcome addition to our office in a time of uncertainty 
and we instantly benefitted from her skills as a team-builder, morale-
booster, and candy-dish-stocker.
  Those who know Taylor well know that she is the biggest ``Swiftie&#x27;&#x27;, 
the proudest of dog moms to her goldendoodle Ruthie (named in honor of 
her idol, Ruth Bader Ginsburg), and is fiercely passionate about making 
positive change in the world. She is incredibly kind, a listening ear 
to anybody who needs it, and a powerhouse in this work as a servant 
leader. She is a true professional in this field, and it has been a joy 
and an honor working with her over the past year and a half.
  The people of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District were lucky to 
have her dedication and leadership, and I&#x27;m extraordinarily happy that 
she will continue to do this work and serve the Nation and the people 
of Minnesota&#x27;s Third Congressional District. I wish Taylor all the best 
in her future endeavors and thank her for her service to this Nation in 
my office--and many more to come.

                      RECOGNIZING JULIAN A. PURDY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MARK TAKANO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 3, 2024

  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the service of Julian A. 
Purdy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Policy of Veterans&#x27; Employment 
and Training Service (VETS) in the U.S. Department of Labor. The Deputy 
Assistant Secretary previously served on our Committee&#x27;s staff, and has 
proven his dedication to America&#x27;s veterans, servicemembers, and their 
families over his impressive career thus far.
  Mr. Purdy&#x27;s career began with his time as a Counterintelligence Agent 
and Human Intelligence Collector in the U.S. Army Reserves from 2004-
2012. During this time, Mr. Purdy deployed in support of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. He balanced his obligations in the Reserves with 
service-oriented civilian careers, including working as an instructor 
for future military intelligence Soldiers.
  Following his military service, Mr. Purdy began a career within the 
Federal Government, first with the House of Representatives. As a 
Legislative Assistant for Rep. Adam Smith (WA-9), he managed a diverse 
portfolio of policy issues, including veteran affairs, gun reform and 
criminal justice. While serving as a Professional Staff Member on the 
House VA Committee&#x27;s Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, Mr. Purdy was 
responsible for policy related to veteran transition, education, 
employment and housing.
  Since arriving at the DOL, Mr. Purdy has led numerous critical 
projects, including overseeing President Biden&#x27;s White House Initiative 
on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity 
through Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Further, he 
spearheaded the DOL signing MOUs with HBCUs to ensure veterans 
attending HBCUs leverage the programs available through American Job 
Centers.
  Additionally, Mr. Purdy led the Office of Strategic Outreach in 
aligning with the White House&#x27;s Defense Industrial Base strategy by 
addressing critical labor shortages. This effort included supporting 
the Department of the Navy to strengthen national security through 
workforce solutions for building submarines and warships.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Mr. Purdy for his 
outstanding professional achievements and his dedicated service to our 
Nation and its Veterans.
