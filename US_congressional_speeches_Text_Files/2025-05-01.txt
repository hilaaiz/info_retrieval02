                  CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ELISE WOBBE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MORGAN McGARVEY

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Mr. McGARVEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Christina ``Elise&#x27;&#x27; Wobbe, a vibrant and talented individual who 
touched the lives of many through her passion for the performing arts 
and her kindness. Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Elise&#x27;s 
journey was marked by dedication, creativity, and an unwavering 
commitment to her craft.
  From a young age, Elise immersed herself in the world of dance, 
singing, and acting. Her early start in dance paved the way for a 
lifelong love of performance. She showcased her talents at the Youth 
Performing Arts School (YPAS) at duPont Manual High School, where she 
graduated in 2024. Elise&#x27;s excellence was further recognized when she 
attended the Governor&#x27;s School for the Arts in 2022, specializing in 
musical theater.
  Continuing her artistic journey, Elise enrolled at Syracuse 
University as a first-year musical theater major. Her commitment to 
excellence earned her a place on the Fall 2024 Dean&#x27;s List. She 
actively contributed to the university&#x27;s theater community, serving on 
the production staff and costume crew for the Department of Drama&#x27;s 
production of ``Pippin.&#x27;&#x27;
  Elise&#x27;s unexpected passing on February 14, 2025, in Syracuse, New 
York, was a profound loss to all who knew her. Her warmth and genuine 
nature left an indelible mark on those around her. Her family fondly 
remembers her ability to light up any room and her knack for turning 
strangers into friends. They expressed, ``She lived her dream each and 
every day with exuberance, determination, and genuine kindness.&#x27;&#x27;
  In recognition of her impact and to honor her legacy, the family has 
established the Elise Wobbe Scholarship. This scholarship aims to 
support a YPAS senior pursuing a career in the performing arts, 
ensuring that Elise&#x27;s passion continues to inspire future generations.
  Elise Wobbe&#x27;s legacy is one of passion, kindness, and artistic 
brilliance. Her spirit continues to inspire, reminding us of the 
profound impact one individual can have on their community.

    HONORING THE APPOINTMENT OF LOS ANGELES POSTMASTER MARICELA LUNA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JIMMY GOMEZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Maricela Luna, the 
first Mexican-American Latina to serve as Postmaster of Los Angeles 
since the city&#x27;s postal establishment in 1850.
  It is fitting that Maricela Luna&#x27;s appointment coincides with the 
250th Anniversary of USPS. As the 42nd Postmaster in Los Angeles, 
Marci&#x27;s story is one of unwavering commitment in service to the local 
community. Luna is an exemplary public servant dedicated to operational 
and logistical excellence befitting of the United States Postal 
Service. Her dedication to innovation and inclusivity sets a high bar 
for all of us in public service, and a living example of the legacy 
USPS which has served Americans since it was established in 1775.
  I am hopeful that Luna&#x27;s groundbreaking appointment will serve as a 
catalyst to inspire to future-generations--especially in the Mexican-

[[Page E379]]

American and Hispanic communities--towards a life of public service. 
May this appointment deepen public trust and strengthen the Postal 
Service for years to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
Maricela Luna, 42nd Postmaster of Los Angeles.

                          ____________________

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Gettysburg Borough Master Patrol Officer Dennis P. Bevenour, who 
retired after serving the community with distinction for over 16 years.
  Officer Bevenour joined the Gettysburg Police Department as a 
Patrolman in September 2008 and was promoted to Criminal Investigator, 
Intelligence Officer and Master Patrol Officer.
  He entered law enforcement after a 27-year career in the United 
States Air Force. His impressive record of public service also includes 
roles as a volunteer firefighter and Probation and Parole Officer.
  Officer Bevenour was widely respected by colleagues and supervisors 
for his expertise in criminal investigations. He was instrumental in 
securing grant funding to enhance the security of the borough building 
and to upgrade the police department&#x27;s records management system.
  Throughout the Borough of Gettysburg and beyond, Officer Bevenour&#x27;s 
legacy of dedication, professionalism and community service will be 
forever respected and appreciated.
  On behalf of everyone in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th Congressional District, 
I express gratitude to Officer Bevenour for an extraordinary record of 
military and public service and offer fond wishes for joy and 
contentment in retirement.

     HOUSE REPUBLICANS SENSELESS ATTACKS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND OUR 
                              ENVIRONMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans just wasted another week 
in Washington with no legislation to show for it that would address our 
shrinking economy or rising cost of living.
  Instead, they launched a series of attacks on a national park, an 
endangered species, and the ability of states to set strong standards 
to protect the air that we breathe.
  H.J. Res. 60 would prevent the National Park Service from regulating 
motor vehicle use in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, where 
just 6 percent of the roads had safeguards put in place to restrict the 
damage that off-road vehicles had caused. This was a narrowly focused 
rule to target protections in sensitive areas for the cultural sites, 
native wildlife, and other natural resources that the Park contains.
  H.J. Res 87, H.J. Res. 88, and H.J. Res. 89 all attempt to misuse the 
Congressional Review Act (CRA) process to overturn decisions at the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce air pollution. Under 
the Clean Air Act (CAA), California can apply for waivers to set its 
own vehicle emissions standards, and other states can adopt 
California&#x27;s exact regulations under certain circumstances. The law 
explicitly grants these states the ability to protect their citizens 
from air pollution and address climate change with stronger standards, 
and in doing so they are saving Americans $89 billion in fuel costs 
through 2040.
  These Republican resolutions would make the air dirtier, raise costs 
for drivers, and also violate the law. The Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) and the Senate Parliamentarian have already made it clear 
that CAA waivers do not qualify as a target for a CRA. These decisions 
are not rules subject to review, but House Republicans are ignoring the 
law to try to set a precedent for drastically expanding what other 
protections for the American people they can undermine with a CRA.
  As if all this wasn&#x27;t enough, Republicans wrapped up the week with an 
attack on an endangered species of smelt in the San Francisco Bay-
Delta. Delisting a fish won&#x27;t solve the water shortage problems of the 
West; it is a distraction from the real issues of climate change, 
outdated infrastructure, and competing water allocations. Furthermore, 
this smelt is a critical part of the foodweb in an ecosystem on the 
verge of collapse. H.J. Res. 78 would not only overturn the current 
listing of the longfin smelt but prevent it from ever being listed in 
the future, no matter how much the threat to this species and its 
estuary increased.
  I voted against all five of the Congressional Review Act resolutions 
that were brought to the floor this week, and I urge the Republican 
House Majority to stop bringing these harmful and nonsensical attacks 
on our public health and the environment to the House floor. Stripping 
away protections for our wildlife, for our national parks, and for the 
very air in our lungs doesn&#x27;t improve Americans lives.

  RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF GADSDEN STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MIKE ROGERS

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I ask for the House&#x27;s attention 
today to recognize the 100th anniversary of Gadsden State Community 
College. Gadsden State is currently under the leadership of President 
Dr. Kathy Murphy.
  One of the initial founding institutions of Gadsden State is the 
Alabama School of Trades. It was established in 1925 as the first 
state-operated trade school in Alabama and the entire southern United 
States.
  Classes began on September 16, 1925, with 42 students enrolled in the 
inaugural class. Four courses were available: printing, electricity, 
bricklaying and cabinetmaking. All students lived in the newly 
constructed dormitory equipped with modern conveniences such as steam 
heat and plumbing that featured hot and cold running water. Students 
helped government workmen lay bricks to build the school&#x27;s first 
permanent two-story buildings.
  The Alabama School of Trades continued to thrive as a training center 
for the area&#x27;s technical industry with increasing student enrollment 
and course offerings. In 1942, courses were converted to War Training. 
At the close of World War II, new courses were added to help veterans 
re-enter the workforce such as: Radio, TV, Auto Mechanics, Machine 
Shop, Refrigeration, Drafting, Photography, Upholstery, Auto Body, 
Barbering, General Farm Dairy, Poultry and Heavy Equipment.
  In 1973, the school&#x27;s name was changed to the Alabama Technical 
College and began offering associate in applied technology degrees. In 
1985, the Alabama Technical College merged with Gadsden State Community 
College and is now known as the East Broad Campus. It is home to many 
of Gadsden State&#x27;s workforce development programs such as Precision 
Machining, Mechanical Design, Industrial Automation, Welding, 
Electrical, Electronic Technology, Salon/Spa, Court Reporting, Truck 
Driving, Skid Steer Training, Certified Nursing Assistant, Phlebotomy 
and Civil Engineering.
  As a result of mergers and expansion of services, Gadsden State is 
now a sprawling Community College with five campuses including East 
Broad, Wallace Drive, Valley Street (HBCU), Ayers and Cherokee. Gadsden 
State serves Etowah, Calhoun, Cleburne, Cherokee and St. Clair counties 
in northeast Alabama. There are 70 programs of study offered to over

             RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF SERVICE OF DICK YOUNG

                                 ______
                                 

                      HON. NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the remarkable 
life and service of Richard ``Dick&#x27;&#x27; Young, a lifelong member of the 
Lancaster, New York community, who recently passed away at the age of 
94.
  Dick was a proud graduate of Lancaster High School, Class of 1948, 
where he served as class president and remained dedicated to keeping 
his classmates connected for decades. In fact, those remaining from his 
class gathered in 2023 to celebrate their 75th reunion--an 
extraordinary milestone.
  Following graduation, Dick answered the call to serve his country by 
joining the United States Navy. From 1948 to 1949, he served aboard the 
USS Buck 761 Destroyer, supporting efforts during the Chinese 
Revolution. After his initial service, he enrolled at Marietta College, 
but when the Korean War broke out, he was called back to duty--this 
time serving as a ship-fitter on the USS Marsh DE699 from 1950 to 1952. 
In recognition of his dedicated service, Dick was honored in 2019 
through the Honor Flight to Washington.
  Dick returned home to join the family business. His father, Lester 
Young, had founded the Young Fire Equipment Corporation in 1944, and by 
the time Dick completed his military service, he was destined to lead 
the company. As President, he relocated it to 204 Cemetery Road in 
Lancaster, where his Navy-honed skills and forward-thinking mindset 
revolutionized the fire apparatus industry. He designed firetrucks that 
were decades ahead of their time--earning a reputation for building the 
``Cadillac of Firetrucks.&#x27;&#x27;
  Though Young Fire closed in 1991, Dick&#x27;s passion for innovation never 
waned. In 1993, he launched the Performance Advantage Company in 
Lancaster, which continues to design and distribute tool and equipment 
mounting solutions for the fire service, military, and other industries 
in over 38 countries.
  In 2007, Dick established the Greater Lancaster Museum of 
Firefighting, located next to his business. The museum showcases 
historic firefighting artifacts, including those from local departments 
and even pieces from the 9/11 Towers. It stands as a tribute to 
volunteerism, which Dick regarded as the backbone of strong 
communities. He often said, ``Communities cannot function without the 
selfless sacrifices that volunteers contribute. We&#x27;ve got to encourage 
more volunteers.&#x27;&#x27;
  Dick also served his community as an elected member of the Lancaster 
Village Board, where he played a key role in uniting the Village and 
Town to address critical infrastructure needs, including improvements 
to the sewer system.
  Mr. Speaker, Dick Young leaves behind a legacy of service, 
innovation, and unwavering dedication to his community and country. His 
accomplishments, generosity, and leadership set a gold standard that 
will continue to inspire generations to come. May he rest in peace.

               RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF BILL MATTHYS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MICHAEL CLOUD

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Bill Matthys--a man 
whose life reflects a steadfast commitment to education, public 
service, and community.
  Raised in rural Wharton County, Mr. Matthys graduated from El Campo 
High School in 1965, later earning degrees from Wharton County Junior 
College and the University of Houston, including a BA in English and 
Journalism and a master&#x27;s in Curriculum and Instruction. In 1967, he 
married Pamela, his high school sweetheart, and together they built a 
loving family and a legacy of service.
  Following college, Mr. Matthys served on active duty in the United 
States Army from 1970 to 1974, including time stationed in Germany, and 
later in the Army Reserve until his honorable discharge as a Captain in 
1981. His service to our Nation was marked by integrity and continued 
through his 35 years dedicated to public education in Texas. He worked 
as both a teacher and administrator, with 16 of those years at Cuero 
ISD. After retiring from education, he continued serving the community 
through legal work as a certified paralegal at a local firm.
  His civic involvement has been just as remarkable. He has served on 
the boards of the Cuero Chamber of Commerce, the Cuero Lions Club, the 
Cuero ISD Education Foundation, and the DeWitt County Habitat for 
Humanity. For 17 years, he represented the people of Cuero on the City 
Council, including 14 years as Mayor Pro-Temp.
  Mr. Speaker, Bill Matthys represents the very best of servant 
leadership. His life is a testimony to the impact one person can make 
through quiet faithfulness, love for family, and a deep-rooted 
commitment to community.
  May God continue to bless him, his family, and all those he serves.

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special 
tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio&#x27;s Fifth Congressional 
District. I am pleased to announce that William Sikora of Avon, Ohio, 
has been offered an appointment to the United States Military Academy 
in West Point, New York.
  William&#x27;s offer of appointment permits him to attend the United 
States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029. 
Attending one of our Nation&#x27;s military academies not only offers the 
opportunity to serve our country but also guarantees a world-class 
education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding 
experiences of their lives.
  William brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and 
dedication to the incoming Class of 2029. While attending Avon High 
School, he received the College Board National Hispanic Recognition 
Academic Achievement Award, the AP Scholar with Distinction Award, 
attended Buckeye Boys State, and was on the honor role. Throughout high 
school, William was involved in wrestling, earning wrestler of the 
week. I am confident that he will carry the lessons of his student and 
athletic leadership to the Military Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating William 
Sikora on his offer of appointment to the United States Military 
Academy. Our service academies offer the finest military training and 
education available, and I am positive that William will excel during 
his career at the Military Academy. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our 
Nation.

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, May 1, 2025

  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, Democrats will always be a friend to those 
fighting for their freedom--and the American people will always stand 
with Ukraine.
  While ceasefire negotiations may be underway, Ukraine is not giving 
up, nor should they. Russia&#x27;s offensives have stalled. European 
partners and allies are still committed to the struggle against 
aggression from Putin. And the Ukrainian people are speaking clearly, 
through their elected President Zelensky, that they are a sovereign 
Nation, and they speak for themselves. Only Ukraine can decide when it 
is done fighting--no one else.
  It is our job in America to continue to support our ally. History 
teaches that aggressors never stop of their own accord. And they are 
never satisfied with appeasement. If Vladimir Putin&#x27;s war is rewarded 
with Ukrainian land, he will try again for more.
  I will continue to advocate for our ally Ukraine--for their defense, 
for the civilian and military resources they need, and for allowing 
them to control their own destiny. That is our obligation as an ally 
and as the world&#x27;s strongest democracy.
  It is my promise to them. As the lead Democrat on the House 
Appropriations Committee, I promise that I will never give up that 
fight. I will continue to support resources and funding for the 
Ukrainian people, and I urge them not to give up. We must all continue 
speaking out, for as long as it takes, until Ukraine is safe and free 
once more.
