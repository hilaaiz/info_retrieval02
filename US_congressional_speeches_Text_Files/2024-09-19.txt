 BLUECOATS DRUM AND BUGLE CORPS NAMED OHIO&#x27;S 13TH DISTRICT CHAMPION OF 
                                THE WEEK

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. EMILIA STRONG SYKES

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 19, 2024

  Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise today to recognize The 
Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps as Ohio&#x27;s 13th Congressional District 
Champion of the Week.
  On August 7th, on the field of Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, the 
Bluecoats nearly achieved a perfect routine, scoring a 98.75 out of 100 
to win the second world championship in their corps&#x27; history. This 
current win comes on the heels of them holding second place in the 
championships in 2022 and 2023.
  The Drum Corps International World Championships was the grand finale 
for the Bluecoats&#x27; busy summer. The championship was the last show 
after a string of 17 competitive shows and 21 performances on its 
8,000-mile national tour.
  The Bluecoats are a perfect example of why Ohio&#x27;s 13th Congressional 
District is known as the ``Birthplace of Champions.&#x27;&#x27;
  Once again, I&#x27;d like to congratulate the Bluecoats Drum and Bugle 
Corps for bringing this World Championship home. We are so proud of 
your hard work and incredible talent.

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. TED LIEU

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 19, 2024

  Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate September 19, 2024, 
as the inaugural National App Challenge Day. This day honors the 
innovation, creativity, and technical skills of our nation&#x27;s youth, who 
are the driving force behind our future&#x27;s technological advancements.
  The National App Challenge Day was established to encourage young 
students from across the United States to develop their coding skills, 
explore their creativity, and apply their problem-solving abilities to 
real-world issues. This initiative aligns with our nation&#x27;s broader 
goal of promoting K-12 STEM education and preparing our students to be 
competitive in the global economy.
  Since its inception, the Congressional App Challenge has inspired 
over 58,000 students, across all 50 states and territories to engage in 
computer science and technology. By participating in this challenge, 
students gain invaluable experience in teamwork, critical thinking, and 
innovation. The apps developed by these young coders address a wide 
range of issues, from improving educational resources to creating 
solutions for community challenges. National App Challenge Day 
highlights the importance of investing in our youth and supporting STEM 
education. It is a day to celebrate the achievements of all student 
participants and to recognize the mentors, educators, and community 
leaders who support and inspire these students.
  As a recovering computer science major and one of the co-chairs of 
the Congressional App Challenge, I recognize the importance of 
supporting initiatives that foster innovation and creativity among our 
nation&#x27;s youth. Let the National App Challenge Day serve as a catalyst 
for future leaders, innovators, and problem-solvers who will shape the 
world of tomorrow.

         CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS ACT, 2025

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 18, 2024

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this six-month 
Continuing Resolution and the accompanying SAVE Act.
  Most of us do not want a CR and it is deeply unfortunate that one is 
necessary. Once again, the Senate did not get its work done and failed 
to pass any Appropriations bills off the floor. The House Republican 
Majority wasted months writing bills loaded with extreme social policy 
that the American people do not want. And still, Republicans only 
passed half their bills--why? Because they were so unpopular with their 
own conference.
  Having failed to complete this work, Republicans now want to kick the 
can for six months. They will waste half the fiscal year, costing 
taxpayers billions of dollars. A CR this long would be irresponsible. 
The Department of Defense has also identified the consequences for our 
national security. A six-month CR would have negative impacts on our 
Military Personnel and their families. It would not include funds to 
cover the 4.5 percent pay raise for Service Members. It would not fund 
the nearly $3 billion increase required by law for the Basic Housing 
Allowance. And it would not include funds needed to cover medical costs 
for military families and stabilize the Military Healthcare System.
  The Services would not be able to offer new enlistment and 
reenlistment bonuses--harming recruitment efforts. New program starts 
can&#x27;t happen under a CR. This harms innovation and delays getting 
weapons and equipment into the hands of our personnel quickly. Keeping 
major defense programs on time and on budget will be more difficult. A 
CR will delay multi-year procurement of platforms like: heavy lift 
helicopters and Virginia Class Submarines. It will pause investments in 
our space-based satellite architecture. It will prevent full funding 
for the Columbia Class Submarine, and delay procurement of the B-21 
Raider. Finally, CR&#x27;s damage the readiness of the Joint Force. Training 
exercises and operations that are needed to ensure we can win any 
fight--they won&#x27;t happen.
  The Navy will suffer a delay of 58 ship maintenance availabilities, 
limiting work for our public and private shipyards. Air Force flying 
hours, weapon system sustainment, and ground combat readiness will 
suffer. We know this to be true--why?
  We just had a nearly six-month CR in Fiscal Year 2024 which impacted 
DoD&#x27;s ability to budget appropriately. The last thing we should do is 
compound this problem. We also have the Fiscal Responsibility Act to 
consider. Because if all 12 appropriations bills are not enacted by the 
end of April, sequestration takes effect.
  What does that mean? Across the board spending cuts impacting 
everything from national security, to infrastructure, to healthcare and 
education. That is a gamble none of us should want to take.
  To make a bad deal even worse, the Speaker has tacked on a partisan 
voter-suppression tool known as the SAVE Act, in an attempt to appease 
his most extreme Members. If this bill became law, the vast majority of 
Americans would need more than one document to vote. We need to be 
removing barriers to the ballot box not adding more. The Senate will 
not pass this bill, and it will not become law. We should reject this 
legislation--pass a clean short-term CR--and roll up our sleeves and 
get to work.

 DETECTIVE MATTHEW KING NAMED OHIO&#x27;S 13TH DISTRICT CHAMPION OF THE WEEK

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 19, 2024

  Mrs. SYKES. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Detective Matthew 
King of the North Canton Police Department as Ohio&#x27;s 13th Congressional 
District Champion of the Week.
  Detective King was recognized by his peers as the Police Officer of 
the year for the North Canton Police Department. King has been a police 
officer since 2018, and has been with the North Canton Police 
Department since 2019.
  In 2021, Officer King was promoted to Detective King when he 
graduated as the Valedictorian of his Drug Recognition Expert Class, 
earning a 99.14 percent grade point average.
  He is also a member of the Stark County Metro Narcotics Unit and the 
OVI Task Force.
  This honor is not Detective King&#x27;s first award. In 2021, he was 
awarded the Stark County Traffic Office of the Year. Detective King has 
been a model police officer for many years.
  Once again, I&#x27;d like to congratulate Detective Matthew King on this 
distinction, and thank him for his tireless public service to North 
Canton. He is a perfect example of why Ohio&#x27;s 13th Congressional 
District is known as the ``Birthplace of Champions.&#x27;&#x27;

                          HON. BETH VAN DUYNE

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 19, 2024

  Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Texas-24 Hometown 
Hero, Debbie Conard, who has dedicated over 20 years to volunteering 
with the Richardson Fire Department. On the Fire 1 Rehab Team, Debbie 
supports firefighters during large fires. She is on call 24/7, leading 
the photography team and responding to structure fires, capturing 
firefighters as they save lives and property. These images serve as a 
visual record of the bravery and dedication of our local firefighters 
and are on display at fire stations throughout the city.
  After completing the Citizen Fire Academy (CFA), Debbie joined the 
CFA Alumni Association, where she served as President for many years 
and remains active today. Her dedication extends to the Richardson 
Police Department, where she has volunteered for over 18 years. After 
completing the Citizen Police Academy (CPA), she continued to stay 
involved through the board of the CPA Alumni Association, contributing 
to special events, including National Night Out and Safety Fairs, as 
well as photographing for CPA classes.
  Debbie&#x27;s dedication to serving North Texans isn&#x27;t limited to 
Richardson city limits. She volunteered at the Scottish Rite Hospital 
for Children in Dallas where she engaged patients with crafts, books, 
and games. She also volunteered with Equest, a therapeutic equestrian 
riding program for children with diverse needs. Through her involvement 
with the annual 9/11 Memorial Stair Climb, Debbie helps honor fallen 
firefighters and police officers who lost their lives in the September 
11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Debbie is also a volunteer photographer 
for Honor Flight, which celebrates America&#x27;s veterans by inviting them 
to Washington, D.C. to visit the memorials built to commemorate their 
service and sacrifice.
  Those who know and work with Debbie describe her as humble, sincere, 
and deeply compassionate. She has a generous heart and never seeks 
recognition of accolades for her efforts. I&#x27;d like to thank Debbie 
Conard for going above and beyond to serve our North Texas community.

The Fresh Market on being named one of the top Grocery Stores in 
America by USA Today and being ranked number one in the following

  Originally founded right here in North Carolina, The Fresh Market has 
taken its renowned freshness and customer service to over 150 stores

their many baked goods, The Fresh Market has something for everyone. 
The Fresh Market has shown its commitment to providing the highest 
quality food and produce to its customers, and that commitment is 
clearly reflected in these outstanding rankings. I can confidently say 
that we here in North Carolina could not be prouder of our local 
company which has achieved such national recognition for its incredible 
quality.
  Again, congratulations to all the folks at The Fresh Market. They 
should feel extremely proud of all their hard work and dedication.

                      Thursday, September 19, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Marvin Turner, who passed away on August 12, 2024. Marvin was a 
dedicated civil servant and worked tirelessly to make the District of 
Columbia the 51st state.
  Marvin was a native of Atlanta, Georgia. After graduating high 
school, Marvin joined Job Corps and then began his career fighting for 
the rights of workers and for fair housing in North Carolina and South 
Carolina with the Service Employees International Union.
  Marvin came to D.C. to work for the Washington Metropolitan Area 
Transit Authority. Soon after arriving in D.C., Marvin became a staffer 
for then-Mayor Sharon Pratt and then became a member of my staff. In 
2013, Marvin was appointed as a commissioner on the District of 
Columbia Sentencing and Criminal Code Revision Commission, where he 
worked with other commissioners and D.C. Councilmembers to revise 
sentencing guidelines and the criminal code.
  During his career, Marvin worked closely with Reverend Jesse Jackson 
as an advance staffer, as well as serving as the D.C. Statehood 
Coordinator for the National Rainbow Coalition. Marvin&#x27;s work on the 
local and national levels ultimately led to him working for the 
Democratic National Committee&#x27;s Office of the Secretary for nearly 20 
years.
  Marvin&#x27;s work left an indelible mark on both D.C. and our Nation. I 
ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible 
life and legacy of Marvin Turner.

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Pat 
Goin, who will be concluding her tenure as Chair of the North American 
Blueberry Council at the end of this year.
  This August, I had the honor of visiting Pat and her husband Kevin at 
their blueberry farm, Goin&#x27;s Blueberry Lane, in North Judson, Indiana 
as part of my district-wide ``Factories, Freeways, and Fields&#x27;&#x27; tour.
  During my visit, I had the opportunity to learn more about their 
family-owned and operated blueberry farm that has been in business 
since 1980. Just as importantly, I was able to see firsthand Pat&#x27;s 
great character and the passion she has for consistently putting out a 
high-quality product over all these years.
  I am immensely grateful to Pat for the warm hospitality that my team 
and I received on our visit, as well as for the fresh and ripe 
blueberries that she, Kevin, and their family have been producing for 
more than 40 years.
  I also greatly appreciate the leadership that Pat has provided to the 
North American Blueberry Council in her role as Chair on behalf of our 
blueberry producers and those connected to the blueberry industry all 
across our country. Our farmers and agricultural producers are some of 
the most industrious and important men and women anywhere in America, 
and I know that Pat has done a great service by effectively advocating 
on behalf of blueberry growers and their interests.
  God bless Pat Goin.

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Puerto 
Rican Association for Human Development (PRAHD) as they celebrate their 
historic 50-year milestone of service. On September 19, 2024, they 
commemorate this accomplishment at PRAHD&#x27;s Annual Roberto Clemente 
Gala. It is my privilege to

[[Page E931]]

recognize the outstanding efforts of PRAHD to improve the well-being of 
our communities.
  The rich history of this organization started with the mindset of the 
late Roberto Clemente. As a human service agency, the PRAHD staff is 
dedicated to being an open door for community members facing life 
altering obstacles. Honorably, the amazing organization has served over 
14,000 people in the last year, feeding over 400 families annually. In 
May of 1974, the organization began their impact by operating youth 
services within Perth Amboy and have since expanded to serve Middlesex, 
Monmouth, Union, and Hudson counties.
  For 50 years, PRAHD has succeeded in an exemplary campaign for the 
betterment of impoverished individuals. Their expansive human services 
empower the individual to reach their highest potential. I applaud 
PRAHD for its remarkable generosity.
  Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in honoring 
the Puerto Rican Association for Human Development for their 
contributions to the community and congratulating them on this 50-year 
milestone.

        RECOGNIZING THE REPUBLICAN NEWSPAPER&#x27;S 200TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RICHARD E. NEAL

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 19, 2024

  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 200th anniversary of 
The Republican newspaper in Springfield, Massachusetts.
  For 200 years, The Springfield Republican has been the standard for 
journalistic excellence in western Massachusetts and throughout the 
nation. Since its founding by the Bowles family in 1824, the paper has 
been in continuous circulation for two centuries--a feat that few 
publications can attest to.
  Over the course of my career in public life, I have had the privilege 
of working with publishers who navigated the paper through changes that 
have transformed how we receive the news. This includes the likes of 
David Starr, Larry McDermott, and most recently George Arwady. All have 
played a prominent role in the newspaper&#x27;s success in an ever-changing 
world.
  I&#x27;ve also had the pleasure of working with exemplary editors, 
including Dick Garvey, Wayne Phaneuf, and Cynthia Simison. Now, Larry 
Parnass continues their legacy. Their commitment to journalistic 
integrity has upheld the newspaper&#x27;s reputation as an outlet for 
reliable reporting. Chronicling the triumphs and challenges that have 
shaped our communities with sincerity and respect, they have made The 
Republican a generational household name.
  The paper&#x27;s story started with two things: a flat-bottomed barge and 
a printing press. Samuel Bowles and his wife made their way up the 
Connecticut River and settled in Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1824, 
Bowles founded The Republican, and the rest is history.
  From its founding, The Republican prided itself on being a paper that 
delivered accurate news, while never shying away from discussing 
controversial topics. Samuel Bowles III was quick to realign the 
newspaper with the newly formed Republican party and was a strong 
proponent of the anti-slavery movement. It was that commitment to 
adaptability and foresight that earned Bowles, and subsequently the 
Republican, the admiration of a national audience--including President 
Lincoln.
  On April 14, 1865, after a private meeting with The Springfield 
Republican&#x27;s Washington correspondent George Ashmun, President Lincoln 
invited Ashmun to attend the theater with

him and Mrs. Lincoln. Ashmun declined, and Lincoln subsequently wrote a 
note that read, ``Allow Mr. Ashmun and friend to come in at 9 A.M. 
tomorrow. A. Lincoln. April 14, 1865.&#x27;&#x27;
  Later that evening, President Lincoln was assassinated. His note 
inviting Mr. Ashmun to the White House the following day would be 
Lincoln&#x27;s last written words.
  I call attention to this because it speaks not only to The 
Republican&#x27;s involvement in one of the most consequential moments in 
American history, but also to the paper&#x27;s constant pursuit of informing 
its audience of stories throughout the nation and around the world. 
Over the course of its 200-year history, The Springfield Republican has 
reported on a Civil War, two world wars, and conflicts across the 
globe; national triumphs like putting the first man on the moon and the 
invention of the internet; landmark legislative achievements like 
giving women the right to vote with the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment, the genius of Mr. Roosevelt&#x27;s Social Security Act, and 
Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 
1965; tragedies like the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, 
Garfield, McKinley, and Kennedy, and the terrorist attacks on September 
11, 2001. The Republican has been there through it all.
  And while The Republican was there for each and every one of these 
stories of national and international significance, they have continued 
to prioritize the reporting of local stories. Or, as they have coined 
it, ``bringing home the news.&#x27;&#x27; For the last 200 years, The Springfield 
Republican has documented the triumphs and tribulations of this region, 
one filled with a rich history unlike any other; one whose history 
played a fundamental role in the founding of our Nation and its basic 
principles, including freedom of the press.
  Whether it was covering visits by fifteen U.S. Presidents, Martin 
Luther King, Jr.&#x27;s speech at Springfield College, or foreign 
dignitaries visiting from around the world, The Springfield Republican 
was there.
  Whether it was the 40 world championships won by Boston&#x27;s four major 
sports teams, the invention of basketball by James Naismith, Dr. J&#x27;s 
career with UMass basketball, Springfield&#x27;s own Tim Daggett and his 
gold medal victory at the 1984 Olympics, or the countless high school 
athletes who have achieved All-Western Massachusetts honors, The 
Springfield Republican was there.
  When we were ravaged by natural disasters, including the tornado in 
2011, The Springfield Republican was there.
  When we rebuilt our city and embarked on a renaissance that continues 
to take place right before our eyes, highlighted by the redevelopment 
of Springfield Union Station, the reinvigoration of our city&#x27;s 
downtown, and transforming centuries-old buildings into state-of-the-
art housing, The Springfield Republican was there.
  In an ever-changing society, The Republican has endured a constantly 
transforming media market. In a time where social media dominates our 
nation&#x27;s discourse, and misinformation and disinformation run rampant, 
we can continue to count on The Republican for their commitment to 
constant objectivity. On the occasion of their bicentennial, I am 
grateful for their unwavering loyalty to the people of this region.
  I think Dave Starr said it best in his column published on October 
24, 1999, when the newspaper celebrated its 175th anniversary. Dave 
wrote, ``Good newspapers like the Republican and the Union News live on 
because they offer a commodity that is worth the price. It&#x27;s not just 
the news and the ads, the television listings and the sports pages, the 
comics and the crossword puzzles. They are important, but they are just 
part of what is in a good newspaper.&#x27;&#x27;
  He continued, ``A good newspaper is the embodiment of a community&#x27;s 
hopes and dreams, its yearnings and its aspirations. It is the voice of 
the public it serves. It is the mirror of its community. And equally 
important, it is the public&#x27;s guardian against dark forces that would 
erode or even destroy the people&#x27;s rights and freedoms.&#x27;&#x27;
  As we celebrate The Republican&#x27;s 200th anniversary, we thank all 
those who have played and continue to play a part in upholding the 
paper&#x27;s mission of bringing home the news--news that embodies our 
community here in the Pioneer Valley and promotes the tenets of a free 
press.
  The Springfield Republican has been there, and they will continue to 
be there for generations to come. Congratulations from the United 
States of America.
