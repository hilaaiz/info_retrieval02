  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Dorothy Amerson-
Law, who is entering a well-deserved retirement after fifty years with 
M&amp;T Bank. With her dedication to service and passion for altruism, Ms. 
Amerson-Law is a true pillar of our community.
  A born and raised Buffalonian, Ms. Amerson-Law attended Kensington 
High School, where she was a star athlete and discovered her passion 
for banking. She then secured a prestigious internship with M&amp;T Bank. 
Her excellence in relationship management and risk remediation earned 
her a permanent position within M&amp;T Bank&#x27;s retail branches.
  For five decades, Ms. Amerson-Law served as an Accounting Associate 
within M&amp;T Bank&#x27;s Finance Division. She worked in numerous departments 
throughout her tenure, including Retail Banking, Auto Lending, 
Installment Loans, Credit Card Processing, and Financial Controls. In 
recognition of her exceptional client service, Ms. Amerson-Law received 
multiple ``High Five&#x27;&#x27; awards.
  Beyond her professional work, Ms. Amerson-Law is deeply committed to 
giving back to her community. She serves as the National Vice President 
of the African American Resource Group and organized M&amp;T Bank&#x27;s Annual 
Juneteenth Festival. Further, Ms. Amerson-Law dedicates her time as a 
volunteer to numerous organizations, including Erie County&#x27;s ``Day of 
Caring,&#x27;&#x27; the Salvation Army, Edward Saunders Community Center,

Amerson-Law&#x27;s compassion and community spirit shone through in the 
aftermath of the May 14 shooting, as she played a crucial role in 
distributing food and resources to all those affected.
  Ms. Amerson-Law has earned numerous accolades in recognition of her 
outstanding contributions to our community. In February 2024, she 
received the inaugural Dorothy Amerson-Law Legacy Award. This award, 
named in Ms. Amerson-Law&#x27;s honor, was a testament to her embodiment of 
M&amp;T&#x27;s core values of Candor, Ownership, Curiosity, Integrity, and 
Collaboration. Additionally, Ms. Amerson-Law received the esteemed

family.
  Today, Ms. Amerson-Law enters a well-deserved retirement after fifty 
years of dedicated service. Please join me in congratulating Dorothy

  Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the 
Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, Gamma Epsilon Boule on the occasion of its 
40th anniversary, acknowledging its significant contributions to the 
Sacramento community and its dedication to the principles of 
leadership, service, and scholarship.
  Whereas, Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, also known as the Boule, was 
founded on May 15, 1904, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by a group of 
professionals as the first African American Greek-lettered 
organization, dedicated to fostering a spirit of brotherhood, 
professional excellence, and community service; and
  Whereas, the Gamma Epsilon Boule of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity was 
established 40 years ago in the Sacramento region, when its first Sire 
Archon John Wesley Hudson MD wrote a letter on July 27, 1984 stating 
that Gamma Epsilon Boule had completed its chartering ceremony with a 
list of members including fourteen distinguished professionals in the 
Sacramento metropolitan area of which two are still living today 
including Archon Dr. Eugene Spencer and Archon Judge Gary E. Ransom; 
and
  Whereas, the members of the Gamma Epsilon Boule continues to include 
an impressive list of local and national leaders representing a variety 
of professions, including the following: medicine, dentistry, health 
care, law, politics, architecture, engineering, real estate 
development, education, the entertainment industry and business; and
  Whereas, the members of the Gamma Epsilon Boule have contributed to 
the Sacramento community through its dedication to leadership, academic 
excellence, and civic engagement, and demonstrated exceptional 
commitment to mentoring youth, supporting educational initiatives, and 
fostering economic development, thereby enhancing the quality of life 
in Sacramento; and
  Whereas, this 40th anniversary provides an opportunity to honor the 
Boule&#x27;s remarkable achievements and the positive impact it has had on 
the Sacramento community fostering a more inclusive and equitable 
society. Now, therefore, be it
  Resolved, That the United States Congress extends its congratulations 
to the Gamma Epsilon Boule, celebrating its legacy of excellence and 
wishing its members continued success in their future endeavors.
  I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Gamma Epsilon Boule&#x27;s 
40th anniversary and wish them the best on their continued work and 
dedication towards improving the Sacramento region.

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, July 23, 2024

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Zookeeper 
Week, which is celebrated from July 21st to July 27th, as we honor the 
dedicated men and women who care for our Nation&#x27;s diverse and 
magnificent wildlife while educating the public.
  As a proud representative of Northwest Ohio, home to the renowned 
Toledo Zoo, I have seen firsthand the passion and commitment zookeepers 
bring to their vital work. These unsung heroes play a crucial role in 
wildlife conservation, education, and the preservation of endangered 
species. Zookeepers work tirelessly behind the scenes, ensuring that 
animals receive the highest standard of care, from nutrition and 
enrichment to veterinary support. Their efforts not only enhance the 
well-being of the animals but also foster a greater understanding and 
appreciation of wildlife among the public. No one exemplifies this more 
than Laurie Dixon, Lead Zookeeper in the Aquarium at the Toledo Zoo who 
has dedicated her life to this work for the past 41 years. She shared 
with me that ``Zookeepers are passionate about their animals. So, we 
provide the best care that our animals need to thrive.&#x27;&#x27;
  I have loved my Toledo Zoo since I was a little kid. The Toledo Zoo 
is a great place to make memories with family and friends.&#x27;&#x27; Their work 
is essential to preserving biodiversity and educating future 
generations about the importance of protecting our planet&#x27;s natural 
treasures. Let us take this week to acknowledge and celebrate the 
extraordinary contributions of zookeepers across our country. They 
truly are the guardians of our wildlife and stewards of our natural 
heritage.
