      CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH IN MICHIGAN&#x27;S 11TH DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. HALEY M. STEVENS

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 1, 2024

  Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the wisdom of an 
inspiring figure, Dr. Eddie Connor, as we conclude 2024 Black History 
Month. Dr. Connor delivered remarks in observance of Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day in January, and his words inspire me as we continue the 
important work to create a more equitable society.
  It is an honor to learn from so many influential leaders about this 
important history. From the Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage in 
Alabama to local leaders in Michigan&#x27;s 11th District, I am moved by the 
stories and insight that has been shared with me. Dr. Connor is one of 
those figures that I am proud to highlight. He is a 16-time best-
selling author, international speaker, survivor of stage four cancer, 
and founder of the mentoring program Boys 2 Books.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the tapestry of communities in 
Oakland County that make up Michigan&#x27;s 11th District. It was a pleasure 
to celebrate Black History Month with so many remarkable people, and it 
is my honor to amplify the powerful remarks from Dr. Connor as we close 
Black History Month 2024 and continue our work throughout the remainder 
of the year.

                         (By Dr. Eddie Connor)

                          MLK Jr. Day Remarks

       The question that we must ask ourselves today at the annual 
     Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Celebration is ``What can 
     I do to make the world a better place? &#x27;&#x27; Not just presently 
     but for future generations. There indeed is a great work for 
     all of us to do. We must labor and be faithful to be fruitful 
     in order to reap a plentiful harvest.
       He expressed that life&#x27;s most persistent and urgent 
     question must be. ``What are you doing for others? &#x27;&#x27; Dr. 
     King&#x27;s ultimate societal goal was the achievement of 
     structuring a nonviolent beloved community that would embrace 
     those of various ethnicities and backgrounds to all be seated 
     at the table of brotherhood.
       Dr. King declared ``Poverty is the bride of crime.&#x27;&#x27; We 
     look at the disease of violence and mass incarceration but we 
     must unmask it to analyze societal symptoms. The symptoms are 
     poverty, lack of education, dilapidation of communities, 
     unseemly blight, gentrification, and redlining are the 
     symptoms that create the disease and dis-ease that we see.
       His decision to speak out against the tyranny of the 
     Vietnam War made him a marked man more than ever before. Dr. 
     King spoke about the triple evils of racism, militarism, and 
     materialism seeking to redistribute the wealth in the Black 
     community through group economics.
       When Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, 
     Tennessee, his popularity was at its lowest and the threats 
     on his life were at its highest. His name was ran through the 
     streets and now we name the streets after him.
       Dr. King was not killed because he had a dream. He was 
     killed because he spoke out about the nightmare in these yet 
     to be United States of America. He became the moral 
     conscience of America. He challenged our nation and even the 
     world in a greater context, to ``Learn to live together as 
     brothers or perish together as fools.&#x27;&#x27; He proclaimed ``The 
     true measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of 
     comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of 
     crisis, challenge, and controversy.&#x27;&#x27;
       Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., challenged us despite race, 
     creed, or color to come together, stay together and work 
     together. Simply because coming together is a beginning, 
     staying together is progress but working together is success.

                 COMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 1, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, as this year&#x27;s Black History Month ends, I 
rise today to honor two District of Columbia residents who have made 
tremendous contributions to civil rights, Walter Fauntroy and Robin 
Williams.
  Walter Fauntroy served as a key organizer alongside Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., helping to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965. 
Walter was also a noted lobbyist for civil rights, where he played a 
pivotal role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965. Walter&#x27;s 
efforts during this critical period were key to ushering in a new era 
of progress and possibility for all Americans.
  Walter was also the second Delegate to the House of Representatives 
from the District of Columbia, a position he held for almost 20 years. 
During his tenure in Congress, Walter was a founding member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus and a champion for D.C. home rule.

  Robin Williams is an associate director at the United Food and 
Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and a member of the 
National Board of Directors of the NAACP.

  Robin joined UFCW as an employee at the Georgetown Safeway in 1986 
and was elected International Vice President in 2015. As a labor 
organizer, Robin was a lead coordinator for the ``Immigrant Workers 
Freedom Ride,&#x27;&#x27; which brought together tens of thousands of immigrant 
workers and immigrant rights activists for a tour throughout the United 
States to demand respect for immigrant workers&#x27; rights. Robin also 
serves as an Executive Vice President of the UFCW Minority Coalition 
and is a trustee on the board of the Coalition of Black Trade 
Unionists.

  Robin is also a noted community activist. Some of Robin&#x27;s local 
contributions include developing the D.C. Workers&#x27; Rights Board and 
D.C. Jobs With Justice. Robin has been recognized by the AFL-CIO 
Washington Metropolitan Central Labor Council for her impact on the 
National Capital Region.

  Again, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring 
Walter Fauntroy and Robin Williams.

                            FACING DICTATORS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 1, 2024

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging that 
America&#x27;s valued European allies are facing the Dictators with Rule of 
Gun invading Democracies with Rule of Law. The Axis of Evil war 
criminal Putin, the regime in Tehran, and the Chinese Communist Party 
are being recognized for their murderous conduct and threats.
  Last week I served on bipartisan delegations to Munich, Nurernberg, 
and Vienna.
  The Munich Security Conference delegation was led by Chairman Mike 
Turner with Ranking Member Jim Himes. For 60 years, the Conference has 
been an extraordinary forum for world leaders to provide their policies 
with many side meetings.
  Opening day was gruesomely coincided with the announcement of the 
assassination of Alexey Navalny by war criminal Putin. His widow Yulia 
Navalnaya courageously spoke to proclaim the efforts to resist Putin&#x27;s 
oppression of the Russian people will continue.
  Highlights of our Saturday, February 17th meetings at the Munich 
Security Conference were Chairman Mike Turner hosting a 
``Conversation&#x27;&#x27; with the Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko, the American 
German Institute at Johns Hopkins policy discussion with German 
Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius, a speech by Vice President Kamala 
Harris, a U.S.-Netherlands meeting with Dutch Ministers Kasja Ollongren 
of Defense and Hanke Bruins Slot of Foreign Affairs, U.S.-German 
meeting with Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the U.S.-Ukraine meeting with 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a U.S.-Iraq meeting with Prime Minister 
Shia&#x27; Al Sudani, a briefing by U.S. European Commander General 
Christopher Cavoli, and concluding with a dinner featuring former 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov of 
Bulgaria, and Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna of Ukraine, as we 
later met President Iham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.
  The next day, on Sunday, February 18th at the Munich Security 
Conference, key meetings included a U.S.-Swedish bilateral session with 
Swedish Minister of Defense Pal Johnson, a breakfast meeting on 
national security challenges in space with former Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo, a U.S,-Romania bilateral meeting with Romanian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Luminita Odobescu, a U.S.-Ukrainian bilateral meeting 
with Ukrainian parliamentarians led by Yehor Cherniev, and a meeting 
featuring former General and CIA Director David Petraeus.
  In the afternoon, as the Chair of the Commission on Cooperation and 
Security in Europe, I hosted the Commission&#x27;s first-ever side event at 
the Munich Security Conference with the U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE, 
Michael Carpenter. The lunch discussion on the future of international 
institutions and U.S. support brought together Congressional and 
international organization leaders. Our international participants 
included Helga Schmid, Secretary General of OSCE; Mircea Geoana, Deputy 
Secretary General of NATO; Boris Ruge, NATO Assistant Secretary General 
for Political Affairs and Security Policy; Stephen Biegun, Senior Vice 
President for Global Public Policy, Boeing Company; Michael Georg Link, 
Member of Bundestag, Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation; 
Ambassador Gesa Brautigam, Special Envoy for Feminist Foreign Policy 
and Human Rights, German Foreign Office; Majda Ruge, Senior Policy 
Fellow, European Council on Foreign Relations; and Fabrizio Micalizzi, 
Chief of Staff to Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation, Bundestag. 
In addition to myself and Ambassador Carpenter, the U.S. delegation was 
honored to include Congressman Lloyd Doggett, Congresswoman Victoria 
Spartz, and Margaret Grun Kibben, Chaplain of the U.S. House of 
Representatives.
  Afterwards, en route to Nuremberg, the U.S. delegation presented a 
wreath in memory of the over 41,000 murdered at the Dachau 
Concentration Camp during the Nazi Holocaust targeting the Jewish 
people and others opposing Hitler&#x27;s genocidal policies. Mr. Karl 
Freller, Director of the Bavarian Memorial Foundation, expert guide 
Alex Pearman, and Press Officer Verena Bierl provided the gruesome 
history of the infamous camp.
  At Nuremberg, the delegation met with Ukrainian community refugees at 
the German-American Institute welcomed by Professor Andreas Falke, 
Director of the German-American Institute in Nuremberg.
  Tuesday, February 20th, it was historic to host a field hearing at 
the Nuremberg Palace of Justice Courthouse, Room 600, where the Nazi 
war criminals were tried after World War II. The U.S. Organization for 
Cooperation in Europe delegation was bi-cameral with Senator Thom 
Tillis (NC) and bi-partisan with Congressman Lloyd Doggett (TX) and 
recorded testimony by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, as well as 
Congresswoman Victoria Spartz (IN), and Congressman Andy Harris (MD). 
This was a field hearing to examine how best to bring Russian 
perpetrators to account for their war crimes in Ukraine.
  The hearing was opened with welcoming remarks from Ukrainian 
President Zelenskyy, who, addressing the hearing in a video, said ``No 
war can be truly ended without bringing to justice those thugs 
responsible for sparking this war, killing, and torching, deporting 
children and adults . . . When determination arises and justice 
prevails, the aggressor falls and evil gets punished. Action makes a 
difference.&#x27;&#x27; Other welcoming remarks were given by Professor Christoph 
Safferling, Director of the Nuremberg Academy; Mr. Marcus Konig, Lord 
Mayor of the City of Nuremberg; Tobias Winkler, Member of the 
Bundestag; Ms. Angelika Schlunck, State Secretary at the Federal 
Ministry of Justice of Germany (pre-recorded video); and Dr. Georg 
Eisenreich, Minister of Justice of Bavaria (prerecorded video). 
Panelists included: Andriy Kostin, Prosecutor General of Ukraine; Prof. 
Veronika Bilkova, OSCE Moscow Mechanism Rapporteur, Head of the 
Department of International Law, Faculty of Law of the Charles 
University; Roman Avramenko, Director of Truth Hounds; Roksolana 
Burianenko, Program Manager, Ukrainian Archive, Mnemonic; Dr Gabija 
Grigaite-Daugird, Deputy Minister of Justice, Lithuania; Professor 
Christoph Safferling, Director of the International Nuremberg 
Principles Academy; and Both van Schaack, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for 
Global Criminal Justice.

  Following the hearing, the delegation was given a tour of the 
Nuremberg Palace of Justice, including the office used by U.S. Justice 
Robert H. Jackson, who was the Chief U.S. prosecutor for the 
international Nuremberg trials in the 1940s, by Judge Stephan Husemann, 
Judge at the Higher Regional Court of Nuremberg, and Dr. Thomas 
Dickert, President of the Higher Regional Court of Nuremberg.
  On Wednesday February 21st, the CODEL met with IAEA Director General 
Rafael Mariano Grossi to discuss Iran and nuclear proliferation as well 
as the condition and safety concerns of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power 
Plant in Ukraine. The CODEL was accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Laura 
Holgate, U.S. Ambassador to the Vienna Office of the United Nations and 
to the International Atomic Energy Agency. They also met with staff of 
UNODC to discuss concerns about the vulnerability of Ukrainian refugees 
to human trafficking, including from the Research and Trend Analysis 
Branch: Angela Me, Branch Chief; and Fabrizio Sarrica, Research 
Coordinator; as well as from the Human Trafficking and Migrant 
Smuggling Section: Ilias Chatzis, Chief of Section; Panagiotis 
Papadimitriou, Team Leader Technical Cooperation; and Silke Albert, 
Team Leader Child Trafficking and Survivor Engagement.
  The CODEL later received a very informative briefing by U.S. 
Ambassador Michael Carpenter, Permanent Representative of the United 
States of America to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, on developments in the OSCE. Ambassador Carpenter has been very 
effective and will be missed as he now has White House service.
  On Thursday February 22nd, I chaired the bipartisan U.S. delegation 
to the 23rd Winter Meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE PA) in 
Vienna, Austria. More than 230 parliamentarians from 54 countries 
participated in the meeting, which took place in the runup to the 
second-anniversary of Russia&#x27;s illegal full-scale invasion of Ukraine 
on February 24, 2022. Our delegation joined with other like-minded 
parliamentarians to showcase broadbased international solidarity with 
Ukraine in its fight to repel the Putin invasion and restore Ukraine&#x27;s 
territorial integrity. In addition, there was attention to the 
assassination of democratic opposition leader Alexei

[[Page E202]]

Navalny in a Siberian gulag, which underscores the Putin oppression of 
Russian citizens.
  During the course of the sessions, the delegation was grateful to 
host and meet with: President Pia Kauma of Finland, Secretary General 
Roberto Montella, and Ukrainian Head of Delegation Mykyta Poturaiev.
  It was appreciated to meet with Ambassador Peter Burian, former 
Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United States for Slovakia, and 
the successful host of the Fall Assembly in Yerevan, Parliamentarian 
Sargis Khandanyan of Armenia.
  I was grateful to moderate a side event titled ``Enforcing the 
Sanctions Against Russia&#x27;&#x27; co-sponsored by the Norwegian and Ukrainian 
delegations. The panel featured Erlend B. Bjoertvedt, sanctions expert 
Corisk consultancy; Bill Browder, Head of the Global Magnitsky Justice 
Campaign; and Gunnar M. Ekelove-Slydal, Executive Director of the 
Norwegian Helsinki Committee.
  Our delegation, joined by Congressman Brad Schneider, held a 
bilateral meeting with members of the Israeli Knesset MK Ram Ben Barak 
(Yesh Atid Party), MK Hanoch Dov Milwidsky (Likud Party), and Israeli 
Permanent Representative to the OSCE David Roet.
  We also held a bilateral meeting with the Romanian delegation, 
including Romanian Head of Delegation Dan Barna, MP Hajdu Gabor, MP 
Christine Thellmann, and Romanian Permanent Representative to the 
International Organizations in Vienna Stelian Stoian.
  As we look back on this important and historic trip, I want to add my 
special thanks to the educated OSCE staff that helped make it possible, 
including Janice Helwig, Everett Price, Marcus Micheli, Jennifer 
McCuiston, Paul Massaro, Rachel Bauman, Mike Geffroy, Bakhti Nishanov, 
and Steven Schrage.
  Especially important is the incredible work and service of the 
excellent team of Marines who led the complex logistics of the trip, 
particularly MGySgt Wesley Helms, GySgt Catalina Delgado, and 2nd Lt 
Lauren Anderson.
  They and, and all of the individuals above, helped bring critical 
attention and energy to the historic challenges we face as we stand 
against dictators and the rule of gun, and for democracy and the rule 
of law, in Europe and the wider world.

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Barbara Ann 
Guardino who died on January 29, 2024, at the age of 90. Barbara was 
born in Lawton, Oklahoma to Everett and Velta Server on January 11,

years old. She graduated from James Lick High School where she met 
Richard Venture Guardino.

[[Page E203]]

They were married at Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church in San Jose in 1954.

  Barbara and Richard had four dearly loved sons, William Richard, 
Michael Joseph; Mark Anthony, and Carl Thomas. She also loved her 
daughters-in-law: Janet, Patti, Chris, and Leslee, and her wonderful 
grandchildren: Natalie (Danny), Nancy (Tim), Billie (Carrie), Jessica, 
Siena, Jake, Chris (Ashley), and David. She adored her four great-
grandchildren: Taylor, Teagan, Naomi, and Geo, and she was very fond of 
her dog Mi Amigo.

  Barbara Guardino will be fondly remembered by all those who were 
privileged to know her for her love, her kindness, and her dedication 
to family and friends.

  Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring the memory of Barbara Guardino, an extraordinary American, and 
in extending our most sincere condolences to her large and loving 
family.

                         HONORING TOM SKILLING

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 1, 2024

  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of the 
most renowned and beloved figures in Chicago, meteorologist Tom 
Skilling. Tom, a 9th Congressional District resident, has worked for 45 
years on WGN-TV, enthusiastically and accurately providing weather 
forecasts to Chicagoland. His lifelong passion for weather and his 
connection with his audience has earned him a place in the hearts and 
history of this city and beyond. I am proud and honored to call him a 
friend. As he embarks on his well-deserved retirement and starts his 
next chapter, we offer our sincerest gratitude for bringing his 
sunshine to our TV screens for decades.
  I commend Tom Skilling for his unrelenting and contagious dedication 
to the weather. As a boy growing up on the East Coast, he studied 
weather maps purchased with his allowance. Tom moved to Aurora, 
Illinois in 7th grade and brought with him a passion for meteorology so 
strong he had to share it with the world. At only 14 years old, Tom 
gave the forecast on the local radio station WKKD before attending 
class at West Aurora High School.
  Upon completing his studies in meteorology and journalism at the 
University of Wisconsin, Tom embarked on a career that made him a 
Chicago area legend. Joining the team at WGN-TV, Tom accomplished what 
no other did before him--he didn&#x27;t just say what the weather was, he 
told us why it was happening. Bringing a level of accessibility and 
authenticity like no other, Tom connected with viewers&#x27; hearts and 
minds.
  Tom&#x27;s last day on the air brought a 70-degree day in February, 
followed by rain and strong winds and a steep drop in temperatures. Tom 
speaks with tremendous knowledge and gravitas about climate change 
science, and the dangers of not acting to protect our planet. He has 
travelled across the country, including to Washington, to talk about 
``climate disruption,&#x27;&#x27; and led a special series on WGN called 
Forecast--A Fragile Climate. He speaks about climate change frequently. 
I know first hand, since we participated together in a climate change 
forum several years ago.
  He has and earned honorary doctorates at universities and colleges, 
but I&#x27;m sure none of those mean as much to Tom as the love and 
admiration of the millions of viewers who have trusted him to tell them 
about their weather and their environment for the last 45 years.
  As his next chapter arrives Tom&#x27;s lifetime love for weather persists. 
We are grateful for Tom&#x27;s dedication and contribution to this city, and 
he will always be revered as Chicago&#x27;s weatherman.

                         HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 1, 2024

  Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend 
votes as I was accompanying President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., to my 
district--the 34th Congressional District of Texas. Due to my absence, 
I was not present to vote on Roll Call No. 57, Roll Call No. 58, and 
Roll Call No. 59.

  Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 58. I 
stand firm against my stance on government shutdowns as they have 
adverse impacts on every part of the country, national economy, and 
national security.

  Likewise, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 59. It is crucial 
that funding for the

[[Page E204]]

Federal Aviation Administration does not lapse as it would have great 
implications for our air travel, activities and programs related to 
airport planning and development, facilities and equipment, and 
operations.

  Moreover, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 57. Everyone 
deserves a seat at the table and the establishment of the Office of 
Native American Affairs within the Small Business Administration will 
do just that by establishing substantial resources to support Native 
American-owned businesses.

                     RECOGNIZING MR. GLEN STEPHENS

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. DAVID G. VALADAO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 1, 2024

  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Glen Stephens 
for his dedicated service to the Kern County community and to 
congratulate him on his well-earned retirement from the Eastern Kern 
Air Pollution Control District. Mr. Glen Stephens&#x27; career in air 
quality control and passion for public health began more than thirty 
years ago when he became an Air Quality Engineer for the Eastern Kern 
Air Pollution Control District. In 1992, he joined the San Joaquin 
Valley Air Pollution Control District and two years later, returned to 
work for Eastern Kern County. In 2012, Mr. Stephens was appointed to 
serve as Air Pollution Control Officer by the Eastern Kern Air 
Pollution Control District Board. During his tenure as Air Pollution 
Control Officer, Mr. Stephens has worked to expand the Tehachapi field 
office to solve staff members and the District&#x27;s Board of Directors, 
deployed additional air monitors throughout Kern County to improve air 
quality, and advocated for cost-of-living wage increases for his staff. 
Mr. Stephens has also used his expertise to help numerous solar 
projects navigate the rulemaking and permitting processes. Throughout 
his career, Mr. Stephens has been steadfast in his commitment to 
promoting clean air for all residents of the community. He has used his 
decades of experience to support rural communities and work with local 
stakeholders to address complex air quality issues and find common 
sense solutions. He has also strived to engage community members on the 
importance of air quality and preserving the character of rural 
communities across the Valley. His dedication to his colleagues, his 
work, and his community is a true testament to his character. I know 
that his service to our Central Valley community will have a lasting 
impact for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in thanking Mr. Glen Stephens for 
his decades of service to the Central Valley and wishing him a happy 
and well-deserved retirement.

                          ____________________

        RECOGNIZING THE 63RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. PEACE CORPS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JAMIE RASKIN

                              of maryland

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, March 1, 2024

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 63 years of the United 
States Peace Corps&#x27; work in promoting world peace and friendship among 
nations. President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps as the 
United States&#x27; first global volunteer initiative on March 1, 1961. 
Since then, the Peace Corps has sent more than 241,000 Volunteers to 
serve communities in 143 countries. These committed Americans have 
formed enduring bonds of friendship across cultures and championed the 
best of our country&#x27;s values abroad.

  The founding Director of the Peace Corps, Sargent R. Shriver, 
observed that ``Peace requires the simple but powerful recognition that 
what we have in common as human beings is more important and crucial 
than what divides us.&#x27;&#x27; Peace Corps Volunteers have performed immensely 
valuable and meaningful work to advance the vision of person-to-person 
peace-building by living and working in communities abroad. Over the 
past 63 years, Volunteers have learned the languages of their host 
countries to advance development work in public health, education, 
agriculture, youth organizing and community economics. Today, the Peace 
Corps&#x27; mission is in the capable hands of my constituent, Director 
Carol Spahn, who is herself a former Volunteer. This week, I am honored 
to celebrate her work as my Eighth District Local Hero to showcase the 
importance of her leadership of one of our country&#x27;s most important 
diplomatic and service programs.

  I am proud of the generations of compassionate and courageous 
Volunteers who have committed themselves to two or more years of 
service in a land previously unknown to them. Among their ranks are 
many of my constituents from Maryland&#x27;s beautiful Eighth Congressional 
District. This year, my district has sent more Peace Corps Volunteers 
to serve abroad than any other congressional district in the country. 
It is my surpassing honor to represent the many individuals who are 
choosing to live, serve and learn in over 20 countries as Volunteers.

  When they return to the United States, Peace Corps Volunteers bring 
their new vision home. After immersing themselves in the culture of 
their host communities, Volunteers continue to enrich our communities 
with the friendships they built during their time abroad. They bring 
not only their memories but new skills in languages, cross-cultural 
understanding and subject matter expertise. Many Volunteers continue to 
serve our country through other forms of public service.

  As we honor the 63rd anniversary of the Peace Corps, I am grateful to 
the Volunteers and to the dedicated civil servants, led by Director 
Spahn, who make their work possible.
