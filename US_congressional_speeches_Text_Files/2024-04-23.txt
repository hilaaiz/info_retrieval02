      COMMEMORATING THE 109TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 23, 2024

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, 109 years ago, the Ottoman Empire began a 
concerted and systemic effort to destroy the Armenian people, Armenians 
from all walks of life, including writers, doctors, and teachers, were 
rounded up and brutally murdered, clergy were tortured and burned alive 
in churches, women and girls were brutalized, raped and killed, sons 
and daughters witnessed their fathers being murdered, and children and 
the elderly died of exhaustion and starvation on a forced march to Deir 
ez-Zor. 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children, entire families, 
were wiped out in an act of mass premeditated murder.
  The facts of the genocide are horrific and undisputed by historians. 
They were recorded by American diplomats serving in the Ottoman Empire 
at the time who bore witness in official cables to the annihilation of 
the Armenian population. The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at 
the time, Henry Morgenthau, described it as a ``campaign of race 
extermination.&#x27;&#x27; It was the first genocide of the 20th Century--a term 
coined by Raphael Lempkin partly in response to this barbarity.
  Despite overwhelming and ever-increasing evidence of this methodical 
mass killing. Turkey has long engaged in a dangerous campaign to deny 
the genocide and to silence anyone who seeks to speak the truth.
  I have sat down with survivors. I have been welcomed into their 
homes. I have listened to their stories of how their parents, aunts and 
uncles were murdered, how their property and the lives that their 
families built were destroyed. I have watched them relive the pain over 
and over, reopening the wound to keep the history of their families 
alive.
  The United States will no longer stand in dishonorable silence. In 
2019, the U.S. House passed my resolution officially recognizing the 
Armenian Genocide by a near unanimous and bipartisan margin. That same 
year, the U.S. Senate also passed a resolution affirming the facts of 
the Armenian Genocide. And in 2021, President Biden finally cast aside 
decades of shameful silence by our nation to become the first sitting 
U.S. President to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide.
  These historic achievements happened because of a resilient and 
enduring Armenian community and diaspora, and decades of work. It&#x27;s a 
testament to the efforts of thousands of activists, organizations, 
communities, and faith leaders. It&#x27;s a victory for human rights and for 
truth itself, and it&#x27;s something that we achieved working together.
  But we know there remains so much important work to do. These wounds 
are still open, they have not fully healed and in tragic ways, some 
grow even larger.
  To this day, President Aliyev of Azerbaijan echoes the genocidal 
language and actions of more than a century ago with the support of 
Turkey. Beginning on September 27, 2020, and over 44 days, Azerbaijani 
forces invaded and murdered innocent Armenians in Artsakh and displaced 
tens of thousands more. They continued to terrorize the people of 
Artsakh in subsequent military attacks, and by blocking the Lachin 
corridor, leaving 120,000 ethnic Armenian people without access to 
food, water, medical supplies and services, gas, and electricity for 
over 9 months. And then in 2023, the Aliyev regime took full advantage 
of a people they had systematically starved to ethnically cleanse 
Artsakh&#x27;s indigenous Armenian population from their land.
  As we mark the 109th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide with 
pledges of `&#x27;never again.&#x27;&#x27; the democratic and peaceful Armenian people 
face threats like never before. There is real and growing concern that 
Aliyev has his eyes set on land beyond Artsakh. To this day, 
Azerbaijani forces remain present on sovereign Armenian land, in 
violation of Armenia&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
  Though the United States and international partners have condemned 
Azerbaijan&#x27;s aggression and military assault against Armenians, the 
time for strong statements alone has clearly long passed. Condemnation 
must be followed by real meaningful consequences. The United States 
must hold Azerbaijan and its leadership accountable. Crimes against 
humanity cannot be ignored and cannot go unanswered.
  The United States must suspend military assistance to Azerbaijan, 
impose Global Magnitsky Act sanctions on Azerbaijani officials 
complicit in war crimes and other gross human rights violations, call 
for Azerbaijan&#x27;s release of Armenian prisoners of war, hostages, 
leaders of Artsakh, and other illegally detained persons, and urge the 
immediate withdrawal of Azerbaijani forces from the sovereign territory 
of the Republic of Armenia. Further, we must provide robust 
humanitarian assistance to Armenia and the Armenian people, advocate 
for the right of displaced persons and refugees to return to their 
homes in Artsakh, with a commitment to safeguarding their individual 
and collective property rights. Finally. we must also call attention to 
the destruction and desecration of Armenian religious and cultural 
sites by Azerbaijan and urge their safeguarding and preservation.
  On this solemn anniversary, as we pause to remember the innocent 
victims of the Armenian Genocide, we also reflect on the resilience of 
those who survived, and the perseverance of their children and 
grandchildren, who built new lives in the United States and around the 
world, speak the beautiful Armenian language, and enrich our nation 
with the Armenian culture and heritage Armenians refused to let the 
Genocide define their lives or to limit their future potential. 
Instead, they showed the world that Armenians could face the future 
with courage, knowing that they have already overcome the worst 
atrocities of the past.
  Despite the struggles the Armenian people have faced and continue to 
face, it has not broken their faith, determination, or their will to 
press on. They have overcome the harshest of trials, and yet, they 
remain strong and unbowed, in Los Angeles, in Yerevan, and around the 
world. I will always stand with the Armenian community.

            HONORING INDIANA STATE REPRESENTATIVE JERRY TORR

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM BANKS

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 23, 2024

  Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Indiana State 
Representative Jerry Torr as he prepares to retire from the Statehouse 
after almost three decades of service.
  Rep. Torr&#x27;s long and distinguished service in the House has made him 
a legend in Indiana and has earned him the respect of the hundreds of 
legislators who have served alongside him over the years.
  Jerry&#x27;s contributions to the state of Indiana have been numerous and 
significant. Most notably, he was instrumental in making Indiana a 
right-to-work state and spearheaded the legislation that moved Indiana 
to daylight saving time. His work to allow Hoosiers with minor pre-
existing conditions to be insured illustrates his effectiveness, but 
also his advocacy and concern for the people of his state.
  To those who have followed Indiana politics and government for the 
past 30 years or so, Jerry has been a fixture. He has consistently 
represented the best of what it means to be a public servant. Beyond 
his legislative accomplishments, his leadership has been characterized 
by integrity and fairness. His presence in the halls of the Statehouse 
will be missed, but his legacy will inspire Hoosier leaders for years 
to come.

                      HONORING LINDA LEWIS-EVERETT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANDRE CARSON

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 23, 2024

  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to present Linda Lewis-Everett 
with the Sheila Corcoran Hoosier Women Hero Award for her service to 
the country, community, and the city of Indianapolis.
  Each month, my office recognizes women veterans who are often 
overlooked and underrepresented, especially women of color. Inspired by 
its namesake, this award was created to highlight exemplary Hoosier 
women veterans whose service to their community and nation is 
unparalleled. These women are inspirational and guided by a deep love 
for their fellow veterans.
  Known to many for her commitment to assisting others, Linda&#x27;s journey 
of service began at the young age of 22 when she enlisted in the United 
States Army, where she proudly served our country and achieved the rank 
of Sergeant. Her training in the Army led to 22 years in the United 
States Postal Service, before she retired in 2013. Linda has since 
continued to dedicate her life to the betterment of all Americans 
through her work and advocacy in justice, politics, and culture. As one 
of the Top Ladies of Distinction, her work on health wellness 
initiatives such as the American Cancer Society and Senior Citizens 
Connect has furthered Indianapolis&#x27; goal of becoming a leader in the 
medical industry.
  Combining her love for philanthropy with heritage, Linda is a 
steadfast and outspoken advocate for the Black community and women 
veterans. Her volunteer work with the National Council of Negro Women, 
the Indiana Black Expo, as well as her organization Boundless Blessing, 
are a testament to her legacy of service and to her Ghanaian ancestry. 
In 2019, Linda received the Author Academy Award for her best-selling 
book: ``I Still Hear the Drums.&#x27;&#x27; She continues to celebrate her love 
of community and culture through her church, food pantry, and the 
various civic and social organizations she supports.
  Her kindness, compassion, and selflessness have cultivated a movement 
spreading positive lasting impacts for our community and beyond.
  Especially as we celebrate National Volunteer Month this April, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recognizing Linda Lewis-Everett for her 
decades of continued service to Hoosiers and to our Nation.

        INTRODUCTION OF THE ROCK CREEK NATIONAL PARK ACT OF 2024

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 23, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill to redesignate the 
United States-owned Rock Creek Park in the District of Columbia as 
``Rock Creek National Park.&#x27;&#x27; Redesignating this park will highlight 
its significance to the Nation, including visitors to the Nation&#x27;s 
capital, and will help bring much-needed funding for the park&#x27;s 
inviting trails, waterways, and other unique features.
  Rock Creek Park is already a ``national&#x27;&#x27; park, as it was established 
by Congress in 1890 ``for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of 
the United States.&#x27;&#x27; Rock Creek Park was the first federally managed 
urban park and the third federal park ever created, after Yellowstone 
and Sequoia. Rock Creek Park was designed to preserve animals, timber, 
forestry, and other interests in the park, and to ensure that its 
natural state is maintained as much as possible not only for D.C. 
residents, but for all Americans. The park also preserves the ancient 
history of the land, as it was used for temporary settlements and as a 
quarry for weapons and tools by Native Americans from 7000 BCE until 
the 1600s.
  Since Congress first designated Rock Creek Park, several structures 
and properties have been established or donated to further preserve 
Rock Creek Park, creating a vast connected park area that falls under a 
central National Park Service jurisdiction. In 1892, the federal 
government acquired Peirce Mill in Rock Creek Park, one of the mills 
used by local farmers during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. In 
1950, the Old Stone House located in Georgetown, with its pre-
Revolutionary War architecture, was acquired by the park. The building 
was restored and programs explain the house&#x27;s rich history from the 
colonial period to the present day. The Fort Circle Parks were also 
acquired to interpret and preserve the Civil War Defenses of 
Washington, which created a ring of protection for the Nation&#x27;s capital 
during the Civil War. The Carter Barron Amphitheater, established in 
honor of the 150th anniversary of the Nation&#x27;s capital, became an 
integral part of D.C.&#x27;s live music scene, and has featured acts 
including Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Ross, and Earth, Wind and Fire, as 
well as local artists. The redesignated ``Rock Creek National Park&#x27;&#x27; 
would encompass these later additions to the park.
  Today, Rock Creek Park offers residents of D.C., Maryland, and 
Northern Virginia, as well as visitors, an escape from our increasingly 
urban environment. Residents and tourists alike enjoy many activities 
in the park&#x27;s 2,000 acres, including hiking and biking on the trails, 
horseback riding, picnicking, tennis, and other recreational activities 
in some of the open fields. Our residents have expressed their 
appreciation by volunteering to clean up and maintain the forests, 
trails, and waterways.
  In 1918, landscape architects John Charles Olmstead and Frederick Law 
Olmstead, Jr. wrote of Rock Creek Park, ``No matter how perfect the 
scenery of the park may be or may become, no matter how high its 
potential value, that value remains potential except insofar as it is 
enjoyed by large and ever larger numbers of people, poor and rich 
alike,&#x27;&#x27; Redesignating Rock Creek Park as Rock Creek National Park will 
help recognize the national status of the park and protect and 
revitalize this remarkable resource in our Nation&#x27;s capital.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BATTERY COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. TRACEY MANN

                               of kansas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, April 23, 2024

  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 100th anniversary of 
Battery Council International. In March 1924, 25 firms launched the 
National Battery Manufacturer&#x27;s Association--the group that would 
eventually become BCI. Since then, BCI has been the leading trade 
association for unlocking the potential of energy storage and 
supporting the commercial integration of essential products. BCI 
members are committed to safe, responsible battery manufacturing.
  The United States&#x27; lead battery industry has more than 165 GWh of 
manufacturing capacity across 39 facilities, 250,000 lead battery 
collection and distribution sites, and 9 lead battery recycling 
facilities. Each of these components supports the nearly 100 percent 
recycle rate for lead batteries, creating an impressive circular 
economy.
  In the last century, BCI members have created batteries to power 
nearly a billion vehicles in the U.S. alone--powering individuals, 
families, and businesses along the way.
  In 2022, I visited a BCI member, Stryten Energy, which has a 
manufacturing facility in the Big First District of Kansas. Stryten&#x27;s 
stored energy solutions are built in the U.S. and power everything from 
forklifts, cars, trains, trucks, microgrids, submarines, and more. 
Stryten has over a century of expertise and is the only energy storage 
solutions provider in North America that can offer advanced lead, 
lithium, and vanadium battery solutions to solve complex storage 
challenges. Companies like Stryten Energy make BCI a strong and 
essential voice in the energy and defense industries. I congratulate 
the Battery Council International on its 100th anniversary and for all 
the work they do to accelerate the future of energy storage in the U.S. 
and beyond.
