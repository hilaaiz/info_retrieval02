            CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF WINIFRED WHITE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday 
of Mrs. Winifred White.
  Winifred was born on December 10, 1924, to Thomas and Frances Marsh 
at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, California. Born the middle child 
between her two sisters, Wilma and Georgia, Winifred attended Emerson 
Junior High School followed by Kern County Union High School, which is 
known today as Bakersfield High School. Even back in those early years, 
Winifred recalls the societal and technological milestones she felt in 
her life and the community around her, like when her family discarded 
their ice box to buy their first refrigerator after her father quit the 
Union Ice Company. With her sisters, Winifred brought life to the 
emerging Bakersfield community, attending performances, ice skating, 
and enjoying ice cream sodas at Dewar&#x27;s Candy Shop.
  Following her graduation from high school, Winifred attended summer 
school at a junior college in the Pasadena area, where she found a 
lifelong passion for bookkeeping. She soon met her first husband, Jim 
Bolin, with whom they had a daughter, Marcia. Winifred later met Vince 
Bittleston, an Air Force officer stationed at Minter Field, and the 
couple would soon be engaged. They would bring a son into the world in 
1946--Lawrence Thomas Bittleston--and a second son in 1947--Allan Lee 
Bittleston. Vince flew planes in World War II and the couple would 
share a love of aviation and travel for their entire lives. In 1947, 
the couple launched a crop-dusting business where Winifred managed the 
bookkeeping, bills, and inventory, and Vince handled sales and flew the 
planes. Two years later, with the crop-dusting business growing, the 
couple built a three-bedroom house together and owned their first 
washer and dryer. To spend more time as a family, Winifred and Vince 
later moved to a home in Buttonwillow and bought their three children a 
horse.
  Finding herself in a new town, Winifred became involved nearly in 
every local community

organization. She served as Secretary of Lady Lions, President of the 
local Parent Teacher Association, Vice President of the local American 
Legion Post, and Den Mother of the Cub Scouts. Winifred is the first 
woman to have been nominated to run for mayor of Buttonwillow. While 
the race was unsuccessful, Winifred would go on to serve on the staff 
of several mayors.
  Vince sadly passed away in October of 1991, following nearly 46 years 
of marriage. Winifred later remarried Cliff White, a longtime friend 
and the builder of her Buttonwillow home. As both were previously 
widowed, it marked a new beginning of their future journey together as 
a loving couple.
  Winifred White is the proud mother of three, grandmother of seven, 
great-grandmother of eight, and great-great-grandmother of two. Through 
marriage and love, Winifred has herself become a beloved matriarch and 
a beloved member of our community. Kern County is blessed with Winifred 
and other women like her, who serve as a model for community 
involvement and the American Dream.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in celebrating the 100th birthday of Mrs. Winifred White, an 
amazing woman who has grown with Kern and helped our community thrive.

                  HONORING 50 YEARS OF WESLEY HOUSING

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR.

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Wesley Housing as they mark 
50 years of service to our community. I am incredibly appreciative of 
the vision, dedication, and tireless work that the team at Wesley 
Housing does to address the critical need for affordable housing in 
Northern Virginia.
  Wesley Housing was established by Virginia Peters in 1974 in response 
to a community-led poverty study that revealed the lack of viable 
housing solutions for many families. Since its inception it has 
cemented itself as an independent nonprofit committed to changing lives 
through access to safe and affordable rental housing units.
  From its groundbreaking in 1979 with the first property in Fairfax 
County, Wesley Housing has grown into one of the mid-Atlantic region&#x27;s 
largest and most respected providers of affordable housing. To date, 
the organization has developed or acquired 2,915 units across 40 
properties, positively impacting the lives of over 25,000 individuals 
and families. But Wesley Housing&#x27;s influence extends far beyond the 
walls of its buildings. Through collaborative partnerships and a 
holistic approach to resident support, the organization empowers 
families to build better lives, break the cycle of poverty, and 
overcome deep-seated racial inequities.
  Wesley Housing&#x27;s commitment to excellence and its transformative work 
in the region have earned the organization numerous accolades over the 
years. In 2022, the Housing Association of Nonprofit Developers (HAND) 
named Wesley Housing ``Nonprofit Developer of the Year&#x27;&#x27; for the third 
time, recognizing the organization&#x27;s ongoing contributions to 
affordable housing. Other prestigious honors include the SatisFacts&#x27; 
Resident Superior Award, which Wesley Housing has won seven consecutive 
years due to exceptional ratings from residents, and recognition from 
Affordable Housing Finance, which ranked Wesley Housing among the ``Top 
50 Affordable Housing Developers&#x27;&#x27; in 2021.
  I am honored to celebrate Wesley Housing&#x27;s important milestone and 
want to express my deepest gratitude to the entire team, its partners, 
and the countless individuals who have benefited from its life-changing 
work. Wesley Housing&#x27;s continued success is a testament to the power of 
community-driven solutions and its unwavering commitment to improving 
the lives of those who need it most.

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize Alicia 
Aguirre, Councilmember for the City of Redwood City, upon the 
conclusion of her 19 years of service to our community.
  Alicia is the daughter of immigrant parents from Mexico, first 
generation to graduate from college, and proud mother of two young men

a Second Language (ESL) and Spanish Departments. She currently serves 
as the ESL Department&#x27;s Coordinator. She was also a former Visiting 
Dean at the Sequoia Union High School District as Director of English 
Learners. Her passion for education is evident in her volunteer and 
community activities that have empowered others to achieve. She served 
for six years as a Trustee, with one year as President, of the Redwood 
City Elementary School Board before her appointment to the City 
Council. She served as a Trustee for Notre Dame De Namur University in 
Belmont, on the Mt. Carmel and Garfield Charter School Boards, and as 
Board Member for the Redwood City Library Foundation.
  Alicia was appointed to the City Council of Redwood City in January 
2005 and was elected in November 2005, and re-elected in 2007, and 
2011, 2015, and 2020 for a total of 19 years, amongst the longest-
tenured City Councilmembers in San Mateo County. She has served as both 
Vice Mayor and then Mayor from 2011-2013 and is the first Latina Mayor 
in the history of Redwood City.
  As an engaged community leader, Alicia has served on various local

San Mateo County, Redwood City International, Philanthropic Ventures 
Foundation, Redwood City-San Mateo County Chamber of Commerce and its 
Leadership Program Committee, Latino Leadership Council of San Mateo 
County, and Latino Community Council of Redwood City. And in her 
capacity as a Redwood City Councilmember, Alicia represented the City 
and community on the Statewide Latino Caucus Executive Board, the 
Latino Political Action Committee, Metropolitan Transportation 
Commission, the San Mateo County City/County Association of 
Governments, and the Peninsula Division of the League of California 
Cities.
  Because of her numerous contributions, Alicia has been recognized for 
her accomplishments with many awards including being named California&#x27;s 
Assembly District 21, Woman of the Year in 2012 by Assemblyman Rich 
Gordon, being inducted into the Chamber San Mateo County&#x27;s Hall of 
Fame, receiving the Ohtli Award and medal by the Mexican Government for 
her support of the Mexican community abroad, and being honored for her 
contributions towards affordable housing with the Housing Hall of Fame

  During the Covid-19 pandemic, Alicia focused on keeping residents and 
business owners informed about County and State health orders, safely 
providing city services and funding for emergency rental assistance, 
and ensuring local hospitals were prepared for an evolving disease. 
Alicia also worked tirelessly during the pandemic to sustain Redwood 
City&#x27;s local economy by supporting small business emergency grant 
programs, allowing safe business operations outdoors, advocating for 
childcare providers and promoting safe return to work for local 
companies to encourage workers to shop and dine again in Redwood City.
  With improving housing access as one her primary policy goals, Alicia 
supported housing for all income levels, especially affordable housing 
for vulnerable groups like seniors, veterans and the homeless, and 
missing middle housing for young families and new residents. Alicia 
played an integral role in assisting the unhoused population through 
her work with LifeMoves, which strives to end homelessness by providing 
interim housing, supportive services, and building collaborative 
partnerships. She encouraged new housing in Downtown Redwood City near 
transit, jobs and walkable businesses. She was mindful about carefully 
balancing neighborhood preservation with private property rights 
regarding upgrades like ADU&#x27;s and home additions. She supported Safe 
Routes to Schools and prioritized traffic safety on major thoroughfares 
by creating more opportunities for pedestrians and bicyclists to safely 
use closed streets through Slow Street Programs.
  Alicia is a respected and admired regional leader focused on issues 
of social equity and immigrant rights, affordable housing, 
transportation, and economic empowerment for all socio-economic 
residents of Redwood City and in our community. Alicia Aguirre&#x27;s 
hallmark is her diligent work, her deep compassion, and her profound 
connection with every segment of our community. Her thoughtful 
approach, building bridges, and mentoring the next generation of 
leaders has been transformative and serves as model for others to 
emulate. The effectiveness of a leader can be judged by their lasting 
impact. By that measure, Alicia has excelled as she leaves Redwood City 
in a better place.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues please join me in congratulating 
Alicia Aguirre for an exemplary record of service to Redwood City, 
commending her for her tireless dedication of time and talent, and 
wishing her all the best in the years ahead.

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Alisa McAvoy, School Board 
Trustee for the Redwood City School District, upon her retirement after 
17 years of dedication and advocacy for public education.
  Alisa was born in Oxnard, California in 1963. She moved to Northern 
California where she attended Stanford University to pursue her 
Bachelor and Master&#x27;s degrees in Civil/Environmental Engineering with 
an energy planning emphasis and graduated in 1987.
  Alisa&#x27;s commitment to protecting the environment has been illustrated 
by her time working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Dedicated to pollution prevention and agriculture sustainability, she 
worked as an engineer and manager overseeing hazardous waste management 
projects across several states.
  Alisa&#x27;s journey into educational advocacy began in 2007, when she was 
elected to the Redwood City School District Board of Trustees. During 
her years on the Board, Alisa served as Board President and Vice 
President three times. Additionally, she has participated on numerous 
District committees including Policy, Wellness, Call to Action, School 
Choice Programmatic, Local Control Accountability, Superintendent&#x27;s 
Advisory, Feasibility Study, and Community Outreach. The length and 
depth of knowledge and experience acquired through active participation 
in Board committees deepened her commitment and tireless advocacy for 
education.
  As a school board trustee, Alisa has engaged extensively with 
community members, parents, staff, teachers, and elected officials to 
foster collaboration to ensure a high caliber and meaningful public 
education for all students. Her leadership includes chairing 
initiatives and successfully advancing multiple Redwood City School

facility upgrades, capital projects, ongoing operations, and 
educational programs.
  Alisa has devoted numerous volunteer hours at school events across 
San Mateo County, and in the schools, helping with math, art, field 
trips, special events, science and more. Alisa has always advocated for 
education, especially for adequate and consistent funding with 
community partners, parents, elected officials, state and federal 
officials and non-profits and community groups.
  With a passion for service, Alisa, has served on various boards 
including Little Hands, Carlmont Parents Nursery School, Clifford 
School Parent Teacher Organization, Redwood City Education Foundation, 
North Star Site Council, Family Connections, and the Family Connections 
Authors Night, Emerald Lake Country Club, Redwood City Woman&#x27;s Club, 
League of Women Voters, San Mateo County iZone Leadership Team and 
Policy, and San Mateo County Community Choice Energy Advisory 
Committee.
  Because of exemplary service in public education, Alisa has been 
recognized for her achievements, receiving Outstanding Volunteer of the 
Year Award in 2011 from Family Connections, the Golden Oak Service 
Award from the California State Parent Teacher Association, and the 
17th District Parent Teacher Association in 2020. For her decades of 
service to the San Mateo County education community as a Redwood City 
School District Trustee, Alisa was recognized with the 2024 J. Russell 
Kent Award.
  When Alisa is not advocating for public education, she enjoys 
bicycling, hiking, enjoying nature, cooking, attending musicals and 
concerts, and spending quality time with family and friends. She 
resides in Redwood City with her husband, Neil McAvoy, and has two 
daughters Marissa and Clara.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the 
extraordinary service to public education that Alisa McAvoy has 
demonstrated over the past 17 years. All the families that she has 
impacted through her advocacy are better off because of her 
determination to improve student education outcomes.

  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Councilmember Alvin L. Royse, fondly known as ``Al,&#x27;&#x27; for his decades 
of exemplary service to his community, his profession, and his family. 
As Councilmember Royse completes his third term on the Hillsborough

deep expertise and collaborative spirit to the role. Al has served as 
Public Works Commissioner since 2021, after serving as Finance 
Commissioner from 2013 to 2020. His tenure on the Council has been 
marked by his steadfast advocacy for fiscal responsibility and 
sustainable infrastructure development.
  Beyond his contributions to local government, Al&#x27;s impact extends to 
national service. A retired Senior Partner with Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, 
he distinguished himself as Global and U.S. National Managing Partner 
for Tax Industries, among other leadership roles. A Certified Public 
Accountant and attorney, Al has also lent his expertise as a consultant 
to businesses and a lecturer on global economics, corporate ethics, and 
leadership development.
  Al&#x27;s contributions to nonprofit organizations are equally 
significant. He is a past National Chairman of both the American Heart 
Association and Voices for Healthy Kids. His work for these 
organizations earned him numerous accolades, including the 2021 Gold 
Heart Award and the 2024 Morgan Stark Memorial Award from the American 
Heart Association. Locally, he has supported education, youth sports, 
and civic organizations, serving as a leader for groups such as the 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation, Boy Scouts, and Peninsula Family 
Service.
  A proud resident of Hillsborough since 1985, Al raised his children, 
Matthew and Jennifer, in the community. Al&#x27;s role as a father, 
grandfather, and active participant in his children&#x27;s lives has been a 
source of immense pride. An avid skier, tennis player, and history 
enthusiast, Al is looking forward to spending more time with his 
grandchildren, traveling, and pursuing his-love of reading following 
his time on the Hillsborough City Council. Al&#x27;s tenure is a testament 
to his unwavering commitment to public service.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Councilmember Alvin L. Royse for his decades of extraordinary service 
and his enduring commitment to making his community and our Nation a 
better place. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations of 
leaders.

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Juliana Burns, an esteemed member of our Napa community, as she retires 
from 37 years of service with the United States Postal Service.
  Postmaster Burns began her career as a letter carrier in Vallejo and 
Napa before advancing to serve as a postal customer service supervisor 
in multiple cities. She also worked as a postal instructor in Oakland, 
Maryland, and Oklahoma.
  Postmaster Burns later managed Consumer and Industry Affairs at the 
Postal Headquarters in Washington, D.C. During this period of her 
career, she participated in a national roundtable on the development of 
new postal vehicles. Postmaster Burns was also instrumental in 
establishing postal customer call centers in New Jersey, Michigan, and 
Los Angeles. Additionally, she demonstrated her commitment to 
accountability by conducting financial audits under the direction of 
the Office of the Inspector General.
  As Postmaster in St. Helena, Napa, and now Oakville, Postmaster Burns 
exhibited strong leadership. Following the Napa earthquake and 
devastating wildfires, she ensured uninterrupted mail service and 
introduced free P.O. Box delivery for residents who lost their homes, a 
lifeline to many rebuilding their lives.
  The role of a postmaster requires meticulous organization, clear 
communication, and the ability to adapt under pressure. Postmaster 
Burns has consistently embodied these traits, guiding her teams with 
grace, and fostering trust and reliability among postal employees and 
the community she served. Her ability to lead through challenges while 
prioritizing the needs of others is a hallmark of her career.
  Beyond her professional accomplishments, Postmaster Burns has been a 
beacon of inspiration within our community. In 1983, she proudly held 
the title of Miss Napa County, a testament to her grace and charisma. 
She is affectionately known by many as their ``Favorite Postmaster,&#x27;&#x27; a 
reflection of the respect and admiration she has earned in our 
community.
  Postmaster Burns resides in Oakville with her husband, Steve. She is 
the proud mother of three adult children, Jordan, Samuel, and Addison, 
and is the loving grandmother of five grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Postmaster Burns for her dedicated service to 
our community and

[[Page E1193]]

her lasting contributions to the United States Postal Service. I thank 
her for her tireless dedication and wish her the very best in her well-
earned retirement.

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my 
colleagues Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative Kevin Mullin 
and Representative Jared Huffman to honor the San Francisco VA HeaIth 
Care System (SFVAHCS) in celebration of its ninety years of providing 
high quality medical care and services to our country&#x27;s veterans.
  Conceived of by the newly consolidated Veterans Administration in 
1931, San Francisco VA Medical Center opened its doors on the aptly 
chosen date of November 11, 1934. Located at historic Fort Miley in San 
Francisco, the original medical center remains the flagship of the 
California Bay Area&#x27;s veterans health care system. Over the last nine 
decades, the hospital and staff have served thousands of veterans. In 
2023, SFVAHCS provided care to 94,594 veterans with a combined 870,693 
outpatient visits and 3,203 inpatient admissions.
  Now as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), SFVAHCS 
continues to operate the medical center, manages a 120-bed community 
living center and oversees nine outpatient clinics across its service 
territory. Those clinics are located in downtown San Francisco, 
Clearlake, Eureka, Oakland, San Bruno, Santa Rosa, and Ukiah. The 
health care system is supported by an incredible staff of more than 
three thousand employees and three hundred volunteers.
  For over sixty years, SFVAHCS has partnered with the University of 
California, San Francisco&#x27;s School of Medicine to train physicians. 
Many generations of medical professionals that now support our 
country&#x27;s greater health care system learned from the highly skilled 
clinicians at SFVAHCS. Moreover, the health care system boasts the 
largest competitively funded research program in the VA which is 
driving cutting edge health care innovations and technologies. These 
programs are a benefit to all Americans.
  SFVAHCS&#x27; commitment to high quality health care does not go 
unnoticed. In 2023, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services 
received a 4-star rating for overall quality and a Silver Level 
Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation from the American College 
of Emergency Physicians. In 2024, two outstanding SFVAHCS employees 
were recognized: Dr. Cynthia Delgado as one of TIME100&#x27;s most 
influential people in health and Dr. Bruce Ovbiagele with the W Lester 
Henry Award for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion by the American 
College of Physicians.
  Mr. Speaker, it is evident that the San Francisco VA Health Care 
System is a critical resource for the veterans of California&#x27;s Bay 
Area. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor them here 
today.

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DOUG LaMALFA

                             of california

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the dedicated career and 
public service of Yuba County Supervisor Don Blaser.
  Don was born and raised in the Yuba-Sutter region. He proudly 
attended Sutter Union High School where he would meet his future wife 
and childhood sweetheart, Lavina, Don and Lavina were married in 1968. 
Upon graduating, Don would attend college at the University of 
California, Davis earning a degree in Agricultural Business.
  Don would use his degree to help on his family&#x27;s farming business in 
Sutter County for many years. Don would then go on to work with the 
Yuba City Steel Products Company, where he would work for the next 30 
years.
  Don and his family would visit Hawaii and become inspired by a local 
coffee shop known as ``Badass Coffee from Hawaii&#x27;&#x27;. Don&#x27;s son Adam and 
wife would later open their own coffee shop in Roseville known as ``Bad 
Ass Coffee&#x27;&#x27;. Soon after Don and his wife would purchase The Brick 
Coffee House Cafe in Marysville. This venture would initially need a 
major overhaul and clean-up; while starting as only a local coffee 
shop, it would expand to become a thriving place to visit with great 
food and desserts and be known for their great catering service. The 
cafe would stay as a family business for the next 20 years.
  Don was elected to the Yuba County Board of Supervisors in 2021, 
where he represented District Two. During Don&#x27;s tenure on the Board, he 
would additionally serve on many other governmental organizations, 
working to represent the rural interests of Yuba County. Don has served 
on the Area on Aging Area 4, California State Association of Counties 
(CSAC), North Central Counties Consortium (NCCC), and many others. Don 
also served as Chairman of the Yuba County Board of Supervisors in the 
year of 2024.
  Don and Lavina have been married for 56 years and have two children, 
Adam and Kricia, and four grandchildren.
  We thank Supervisor Don Blaser for his term of service on the Yuba 
County Board of Supervisors and commitment to the citizens of Yuba 
County. We wish him all the best in his retirement.

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the courageous public 
service career and rural advocacy of Colusa County Supervisor Gary 
Evans.
  Gary is a fourth-generation life-long resident of Colusa County 
growing up in the Stonyford-Lodoga area. Gary proudly attended Maxwell 
High School graduating in 1973. Upon graduating, Gary would work for 
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service in 
Fire Management for 12 years. He would then go on to open and manage a 
small sawmill, logging and contracting business in Colusa County for 
many years.
  Gary decided to run for the Colusa County Board of Supervisors in 
2004 earning his first term on the Board, since then he has been 
reelected four times serving 20 years on the Board. As Supervisor, Gary 
would stand as a stanch defender of the Constitution and the Civil 
Rights of local citizens, businesses, schools, churches, and 
organizations. Additionally, Supervisor Evans served as Chairman of the 
Colusa County Board of Supervisors during the years of 2009, 2012, 
2017, 2018, 2021 and 2024.
  Gary has played a pivotal role in bringing the Sites Reservoir 
Project to reality and has made a point to see the project to 
completion which would help provide the larger region and agricultural 
community with the essential water it needs.
  Over the years, Supervisor Evans fought directly for the residents of 
Colusa County. During the statewide Stay at Home Order in the 2020 
COVID-19 pandemic, Supervisor Evans moved to allow those who choose to 
reopen for business and recreation to do so as they saw fit. This 
action would save many local businesses and allow for a quicker 
recovery.
  Gary&#x27;s leadership on the Board has proved instrumental as he 
personally introduced and coordinated a variety of projects in Colusa 
County that have included County, State, Federal agencies, and numerous 
private landowners working towards common goals with a positive. 
``we&#x27;re all in this together&#x27;&#x27; attitude.
  We thank Supervisor Gary Evans for his twenty years of service on the 
Colusa County Board of Supervisors and commitment to the citizens of 
Colusa County. We wish him all the best in his retirement.

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the life of Dr. 
Glen Tate. He passed away this year after a long life spent advocating 
for the Independent Cattlemen&#x27;s Association of Texas.
  Born in February 1948 in Corpus Christi, Texas, Dr. Tate&#x27;s childhood 
was spent on a small farm near Victoria, and quickly moved to Devine. 
Here, his love for all animals, but especially horses and cattle, was 
born.
  Dr. Tate took this love and turned it into a career. In 1973, after 
graduating from Texas A&amp;M, Tate received his Doctor of Veterinary 
Medicine and opened two practices, with one in Alberta, Canada, and the 
other in Lytle, Texas.
  Beyond his business successes, Dr. Tate was also renowned for his 
heifers. His Brangus heifers were frequently the highest selling in 
many special replacement female sales.
  An avid rodeo fan, Dr. Tate traveled across this continent to watch 
the sport and spend time with his treasured friends in team roping.
  Dr. Tate was especially dedicated to the Independent Cattlemen&#x27;s 
Association of Texas, where he served on the ICA Board of Directors and 
chaired the committee on animal health and safety.
  He was also an active member of the South Central Texas ICA chapter 
and served on their board. In 2019, he was awarded the South Central 
Texas Independent Cattlemen&#x27;s Association Trailblazer Award at the 
annual ICA convention.
  Dr. Tate is survived by his wife of 55 years Diana and 3 children, 
Justin, Jennifer and Gaylyn. Glen especially loved family time with his 
6 grandchildren--Lane, Bradley, Tyler, Taryn, Dalton and Josie, as well 
as 3 great grandchildren--Cohen, Stevie Lynn and Lottie Jane.

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor The Philadelphia 
Tribune, the Nation&#x27;s oldest continuously published newspaper serving 
the African American community, as it proudly celebrates its 140th 
anniversary.
  Since its founding in 1884 by Christopher James Perry Sr., The 
Philadelphia Tribune has been a steadfast voice, uplifting and 
amplifying the stories, struggles, and triumphs of African Americans in 
Philadelphia and beyond. From its humble beginnings as The Weekly 
Tribune, a one-page publication, the newspaper has grown into an 
esteemed institution, documenting pivotal moments in our Nation&#x27;s 
history and reflecting the rich tapestry of African American life and 
culture.
  Under the visionary leadership of figures such as Eugene Washington 
Rhodes, who championed civil rights and community empowerment, and 
Robert W. Bogle, its current President and CEO, the Tribune has 
expanded its reach and impact. Through its publications, special 
editions, and community events, The Philadelphia Tribune has celebrated 
Black history, fostered civic engagement, and highlighted the 
achievements of African Americans in the Greater Philadelphia region.
  Over its 140 years, the Tribune has garnered numerous accolades for 
its excellence in journalism and public service, including the A. 
Philip Randolph Messenger Award for Outstanding Journalism and the 
``Russward Award&#x27;&#x27; for Best Newspaper in America. These honors 
underscore the Tribune&#x27;s commitment to truth, equity, and advocacy.
  The legacy of The Philadelphia Tribune is not just about chronicling 
the past; it is about empowering the present and shaping the future. As 
it continues to serve as a vital platform for African American voices, 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating The Philadelphia 
Tribune on this historic milestone and in celebrating its enduring 
contributions to our society.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GWEN MOORE

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, November 22, 2024

  Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the 
life and work of Mahmoud Othman Atta a highly-respected leader in the 
Muslim and interfaith community, veteran, husband, father and 
grandfather. Mr. Mahmoud Othman Atta was born on June 22, 1936, and he 
died on November 10, 2016, at the age of 80.
  Mr. Atta was born in the Palestinian territories in El-Bireh, 
Palestine and moved to Milwaukee at age 16 with his dual-citizen 
father. He graduated from West Division Hjgh School in Mi]waukee, 
Wisconsin, attended two years of technical college and was drafted into 
the U.S. Army, serving as a medic. After his military service Mr. Atta 
returned to the Palestinian territories, where he married his wife, 
Intisar and had two children. He later returned to Milwaukee with his 
family in the mid-1960s.
  He is regarded as the Milwaukee area&#x27;s first de-facto imam, leading 
prayers and religious services in homes, though he never held the title 
full time. Local Muslims hailed from various homelands, speaking 
different languages and Mr. Atta bridged those divides through communal 
worship. He organized classes to teach Arabic, the language of the 
Qur&#x27;an so that everyone would be able to pray and read the Holy Book 
together.
  Mahmoud Othman Atta was one of the Islamic Society of Milwaukee&#x27;s 
seven founding members. Mr. Atta guided Milwaukee&#x27;s Muslim community 
and the Islamic Society of Milwaukee in the 1970&#x27;s, when an estimated 
200 Muslims lived in the city. He helped lead fundraising for the 
purchase of its main center on the city&#x27;s south side and served on the 
society&#x27;s first board of trustees, a position he held for about a 
decade.
  Mahmoud Othman Atta was a natural leader. He saw the value in 
reaching across racial and religious lines, joining interfaith 
organizations and Muslim-Christian dialogue groups. He was respected 
for his character and his knowledge. Mr. Atta would open his home to a 
stranger, realizing how it felt like to be alone without family, so he 
always had a soft spot in his heart for students or individuals who 
were coming from overseas.
  Mr. Atta worked as an engine technician at Briggs &amp; Stratton for 
about 25 years, retiring in 1990 after suffering his first stroke. Mr. 
Atta had been in declining health in recent years and suffered a stroke 
while he and his wife spent several months in the Palestinian areas. He 
returned to the Palestinian territories every year or two, where his 
large family is well-known. About 1,000 people there have attended 
visitations spread over three days, after his death.
  Mahmoud Othman Atta is survived by his wife Intisar; 2 sons Othman 
and Ihsan; 2 daughters Janan and Bayan; and 12 grandchildren.
  Mr. Speaker, Milwaukee has experienced a profound loss with the 
passing of Mahmoud Othman Atta. He had an attachment to Milwaukee, and 
he loved the Midwestern lifestyle. Today, I thank him and his family 
for their immeasurable achievements. I mourn his loss and I salute his 
legacy.
