  CONGRATULATING BARB HEDSTROM AS THE RECIPIENT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL 
    CRIME SURVIVORS AND JUSTICE CAUCUS ED STOUT MEMORIAL AWARD FOR 
                      OUTSTANDING VICTIM ADVOCACY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ANGIE CRAIG

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 12, 2024

  Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent, 
Barb Hedstrom, as the recipient of the Congressional Crime Survivors 
and Justice Caucus&#x27; 2024 Ed Stout Memorial Award for Outstanding Victim 
Advocacy. Barb Hedstrom serves as Shakopee Police Department&#x27;s Victim 
and Community Services Coordinator.
  This award&#x27;s honoree is a professional, volunteer or organization 
whose efforts directly benefit victims and survivors of crime. The 
award recognizes innovations in victim assistance and crime victim 
services in the areas of program development, public or agency policy 
development, community and public awareness, and collaboration among 
community and justice-based organizations that serve crime victims.
  Barb is exactly that. The Shakopee Police Department was the first 
police department in Minnesota to have a Victim Services Coordinator. 
In 2015, Barb worked with her colleagues to launch the Recovery 
Assistance Program (RAP), which helps those in recovery by providing 
scholarships to help break down barriers to treatment. Barb recently 
started the Law Enforcement Association of Victim Essential Services 
(LEAVES), which is a statewide professional association of law 
enforcement-based victim service providers. Due largely to Barb&#x27;s work, 
the Shakopee Police Department has been a leader in the State of 
Minnesota and across the country for victims&#x27; services for nearly a 
decade and has made victim services a top priority.
  It is an honor to represent Barb Hedstrom and the Shakopee Police 
Department in Congress. I look forward to our continued partnership in 
serving the Second District of Minnesota.

                          ____________________

                         Friday, April 12, 2024

  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Mississippi 
State University (MSU) Veterans Business Outreach Center (VBOC) on 
being recognized as the 2024 Veterans Business Outreach Center of the 
Year.

[[Page E346]]

Director Mark Scott has worked tirelessly to make the MSU VBOC a place 
where Veterans are served well. Natalie Rhode, the program director, 
has also played a key role in the center&#x27;s success.
  The Veterans Business Outreach Center is focused on small business 
development for Veterans and their spouses. The center was founded in 
2015 and covers Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
  The Small Business Administration selected the MSU VBOC this year for 
its successes and unique contributions to the local community.
  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. The MSU 
VBOC is committed to excellence while supporting many local Veterans as 
they invest in their communities.
  This award is a testament to the hard work by the outstanding team on 
the front lines at the VBOC.
  I am thankful to have the opportunity to congratulate the Mississippi 
State University Veterans Business Outreach Center on the occasion of 
this award, and I look forward to continuing to work in Congress on 
behalf of our Veterans.

                       Wednesday, April 10, 2024

  Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the lives of the 
six construction workers who passed away as a result of the collapse of 
the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.
  Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, Dorian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, Maynor 
Yassir Suazo Sandoval, Miguel Luna, Jose Mynor Lopez, and Carlos 
Hernandez.
  These men who lost their lives while working on the Bridge were 
everyday heroes.
  These men could&#x27;ve been our fathers, brothers, grandsons, or nephews.
  That evening, they arrived at work proudly as immigrants, ready to 
help build this country with their own two hands by undertaking 
hazardous and challenging tasks that others refused.
  Their dedication reminds us that immigrants should be celebrated and 
acknowledged for contributing to this country--not vilified and 
attacked for where they come from, the color of their skin, or their 
accent.
  They deserve to be praised and remembered. We should be inspired by 
their tenacity and dedication to pursuing the American Dream for 
themselves and their loved ones.
  We will continue to work on behalf of our immigrant community in 
honor of these brave souls. We will rebuild the Bridge and help build 
an immigration infrastructure that celebrates our workers.

                       HONORING DR. GLORIA SMITH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 12, 2024

  Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a trailblazing 
member of the Michigan State University community: Dr. Gloria Smith. 
Her lifelong dedication to education, advocacy, and service has left an 
indelible mark on the university and beyond.
  After earning her doctorate from the University of Massachusetts in 
1971, Dr. Smith&#x27;s journey brought her to Michigan State University 
where she joined the faculty of the Department of Education. Throughout 
her tenure at MSU, Dr. Smith distinguished herself as a trailblazer and 
champion of equity, especially for women of color.
  Her footprint at MSU is immeasurable. In 1972, she played a pivotal 
role as a member of the steering committee for the Black Women 
Employees Association of MSU, where she passionately advocated for the 
hiring of more Black women professors. Her achievements, including 
becoming the first Black woman to attain full professorship at MSU and 
being recognized on the university&#x27;s Distinguished Wall of Professors, 
serve as a testament to her contributions and enduring influence.
  She lent her leadership and expertise as she served as the Director 
of African American and African Studies, as a member on the MSU 
Athletic Board, and on the university&#x27;s presidential search committee. 
In 2007, Dr. Smith retired from MSU as professor emeritus in the 
Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology, and Special 
Education.
  Dr. Smith&#x27;s incredible legacy extends beyond the classroom. She was 
the first Black President of the Michigan Counseling Psychology and 
Supervision Professional Organization. She has also been a proud member 
of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first intercollegiate historically African 
American sorority, since 1958. She served as the organization&#x27;s 18th 
Great Lakes Regional Director and has truly embodied her sisterhood&#x27;s 
mission to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical 
standards and to be of service to all mankind.
  Dr. Smith continues to show her commitment to education and serving 
others as a member of her local chapter of the Links, Incorporated, an 
organization dedicated to promoting quality education, civic 
responsibility, and enhancing the quality of life of their communities. 
She is also a cherished member of her church, The Friendship Baptist 
Church, where she lives their cote value of serving without restraint.
  With profound gratitude for her extraordinary contributions to 
Michigan State University and her lifelong mission to uplift her 
community, it is my honor to recognize her service here, in the 
People&#x27;s House.

     INTRODUCTION OF THE CIVIL WAR DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON NATIONAL 
                          HISTORICAL PARK ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 12, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, on the anniversary of the week of the 
start of the Civil War, I introduce the Civil War Defenses of 
Washington National Historical Park Act, which would recognize and 
preserve the Civil War Defenses of Washington located in the District 
of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland. The Defenses of Washington, 
including forts, unarmed batteries and rifle trenches, created a ring 
of protection for the nation&#x27;s capital during the Civil War. This bill 
would redesignate the 22 Civil War Defenses of Washington currently 
under National Park Service jurisdiction as a national historical park, 
and allow other sites associated with the Defenses of Washington that 
are owned by D.C. or a unit of state governments to be affiliated with 
the national historical park through cooperative agreements. This bill 
would also require the Secretary of the Interior to facilitate the 
history of the Civil War, including the history of the Defenses of 
Washington and the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, being assembled, 
arrayed and conveyed for the benefit of the public for the knowledge, 
education and inspiration of this and future generations. In 2018, the 
House Natural Resources Committee Subcommittee on Federal Lands held a 
hearing on this bill. Although the Department of the Interior opposed 
this bill, I feel strongly that the Defenses of Washington need 
additional recognition and should be redesignated as a national 
historical park.

[[Page E347]]

  The Defenses of Washington were constructed at the beginning of the 
war, in 1861, as a ring of protection for the nation&#x27;s capital and for 
President Abraham Lincoln. By the end of the war, these defenses 
included 68 forts, 93 unarmed batteries, 807 mounted cannons, 13 miles 
of rifle trenches and 32 miles of military roads. The major test of the 
Defenses of Washington came with the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 
1864, when Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Early, directed by 
General Robert E. Lee, sought to attack the nation&#x27;s capital from the 
north, causing Union forces threatening to attack Richmond, the capital 
of the Confederacy, to be withdrawn. General Early was delayed by Union 
Major General Lew Wallace at the Battle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864, 
and was stopped at the northern edge of Washington at the Battle of 
Fort Stevens on July 11-12, 1864. The Shenandoah Valley Campaign ended 
when Union Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan defeated General Early at 
the Battle of Cedar Creek, Virginia on October 19, 1864.
  Nearly all the individual forts in the Defenses of Washington--on 
both sides of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers--were involved in 
stopping General Early&#x27;s attack, and the Battle of Fort Stevens was the 
second and last attempt by the Confederate Army to attack Washington.
  Taken together, these battles were pivotal to the outcome of the war 
and the freedom and democracy that the war represented for this 
country. It is therefore fitting that we recognize the Defenses of 
Washington by redesignating them as a national historical park.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 12, 2024

  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of a very special 
man, Mr. Jack Kain, of Versailles, Kentucky. Mr. Kain was born on June 
18, 1929, and he passed away on March 26, 2024, at the age of 94.
  Mr. Kain was raised on a central Kentucky farm by loving parents. In 
1947, while he was a college student at the University of Kentucky, he 
started selling cars. Mr. Kain earned a Bachelor of Business degree 
from the University of Kentucky. He enjoyed cheering on teams led by 
coaching legends Adolph Rupp and Bear Bryant, becoming a lifelong UK 
fan. He served our country in the United States Air Force as a Second 
Lieutenant during the Korean War. In 1953, he opened his first 
automobile dealership. He continued in the automotive industry, where 
he built a successful lifelong career. For many years, he and his 
family have operated Jack Kain Ford, where they have served over 70,000 
customers since the 1980s. Mr. Kain was a leader in the automobile 
industry. He led the National Automobile Dealers Association in 2005 as 
Chairman. He represented Kentucky&#x27;s franchised new-car dealers on 
NADA&#x27;s board of directors for many years.
  Mr. Kain was a leader in his community and was recognized as Woodford 
County Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s Businessman of the Year in 1992. A 
generous man, he supported education, medical care and research, and 
many other charitable efforts to make the community and the nation a 
better place.
  More importantly than his business and community successes, Mr Kain 
kept his family at the forefront of his life. He had nine children, 
twenty-two grandchildren, and eighteen great-grandchildren. He is 
survived by his wife Alice Stewart Kain and children Vickie Fister, 
Patrick Kain, David Kain, Steve Kain, Bob Kain, and Bill Kain. He was 
preceded in death by his daughters Becky Grimes and Suzanne Hockensmith 
and his son Jack Kain, Jr.
  Jack Kain was a great man who loved his family, his community, his 
country, and his God. He was respected by his community and his 
colleagues in the automobile industry throughout America. It is my 
honor to call him my friend and to recognize his life before the United 
States House of Representatives.

                RECOGNIZING CHIRICAHUA NATIONAL MONUMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JUAN CISCOMANI

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, April 12, 2024

  Mr. CISCOMANI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Chiricahua 
National Monument on the centennial anniversary of its designation as a 
national monument.
  Recently, I visited the Chiricahua National Monument and explored 
parts of the 12,000 acres of hiking trails, campgrounds, and scenic 
views.
  Chiricahua National Monument is one of the most treasured landmarks 
in Arizona. This ``Wonderland of Rocks&#x27;&#x27; features unique, boulder-
balancing rock pillars formed by volcanic eruptions. These abstract 
formations draw visitors from across the nation and around the world to 
the Southeast corner of our state.
  It is a privilege to have this incredible landscape in our own 
backyard. Not only does it provide great recreational opportunity and 
natural habitat, it is also a major driver for southern Arizona&#x27;s 
economy.
  The monument annually supports over 40 jobs and produces $4.4 million 
of economic output, with 60,000 visitors that come each year generating 
$4.1 million in spending.
  Last year, I proudly introduced a bipartisan bill, the Chiricahua 
National Park Act (H.R. 1479), aiming to update the national monument 
to the status of a national park.

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Katelyn 
O&#x27;Connell of Arvada, Colorado. Katelyn was selected as one of 250 high 
school students across the country to participate in the Department of 
State&#x27;s prestigious Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX) Program.

and the United States to live in each other&#x27;s country for one academic 
year. During their year abroad, students will foster meaningful 
relationships between America and Germany, while giving participants 
new perspectives on peoples and cultures beyond their own. Many CBYX 
alumni go on to distinguished careers in foreign affairs and public 
service using the language skills gained through this scholarship 
program.
  This year, Katelyn will travel to Germany, attending school, living 
with a host family, and collaborating with the Department of State to 
integrate into her host community and promote mutual understanding 
between Americans and the German people.
  On behalf of the people of Colorado&#x27;s Seventh Congressional District, 
it is my honor to congratulate Katelyn O&#x27;Connell for this impressive 
accomplishment and wish her all the best in her upcoming year in
