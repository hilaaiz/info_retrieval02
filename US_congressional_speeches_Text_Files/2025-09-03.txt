  Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend the Claremont 
Graduate University on their 100th Anniversary. I include in the Record 
the following proclamation:

       Whereas, in 1925, the Claremont Graduate University was 
     founded on the belief that higher education holds a vital 
     role in shaping the future of our nation and in nurturing the 
     intellectual and ethical foundations upon which our democracy 
     thrives; and
       Whereas, for 100 years, the Claremont Graduate University 
     has contributed immeasurably to the intellectual, cultural, 
     and civic life of California, the nation, and the world 
     through the education of generations of students, 
     groundbreaking research, and public service; and
       Whereas, The Claremont Graduate University has long been a 
     beacon of intellectual rigor, fostering a diverse and 
     inclusive academic environment that has produced leaders and 
     innovators in many fields. The university&#x27;s commitment to 
     transdisciplinary education and research has had a profound 
     impact on society; and
       Whereas, The alumni of the Claremont Graduate University 
     are professionals from diverse cultures and backgrounds who 
     have gone on to become members of Congress, university 
     presidents, professors, health researchers, superintendents, 
     classroom teachers, data analysts, deans, art directors, and 
     community leaders; and
       Whereas, the 100th anniversary of the Claremont Graduate 
     University is a moment to honor the legacy of its founders, 
     celebrate a century of achievement, and inspire future 
     generations to uphold the principles of academic inquiry, 
     leadership, and service;
       Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Congresswoman Judy 
     Chu, representing California&#x27;s 28th Congressional District, 
     do hereby recognize and commend the Claremont Graduate 
     University on the occasion of their 100th Anniversary, and 
     extend sincere appreciation for their enduring contributions 
     to the people of California and beyond.

                          ____________________

also served as a certified National Rifle Association (NRA) Instructor 
and as a Fulton County Sheriff&#x27;s Licensing Course Instructor. Today, 
Peter continues his service by maintaining the Lake Valley Ambulance

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brian Murray for his 
dedication and commitment to serving our rural communities.
  Mr. Murray&#x27;s dedication to serving our communities has been 
incredible through his work to help develop Upstate New York and the 
North Country. A lifelong New Yorker, Mr. Murray is from Peterboro, New 
York and currently resides in Lisbon, New York. He earned a Bachelor of 
Arts in financial economics from the State University of New York at 
Potsdam and went on to work as a commercial lending officer for a local 
banking institution for over 15 years. From 2002 to 2007, Murray worked 
as a USDA Rural Development loan specialist in the Canton Field Office 
before being named New York State Director for USDA Rural Development. 
During his time as State Director, Murray spent a year on the USDA RD 
Community Economic Development team in Washington, D.C. and has served 
as the Associate Enterprise Director.
  Mr. Murray&#x27;s impact on our communities has been profound and has 
helped thousands achieve homeownership and brought in billions of 
dollars in investments towards rural interests. He&#x27;s brought in this 
incredible investment through working with local leaders, state 
representatives, and federal agencies to achieve common goals of 
improving the quality of life for members of rural communities in New 
York. His contributions include supporting rural clinics and medical 
facilities across the state, providing first responders with essential 
equipment, vehicles, and facilities in an effort to keep communities 
safe, and supporting thousands of entrepreneurs in starting and 
expanding businesses. Murray has worked tirelessly and advanced 
education in rural areas to create opportunities for tens of thousands 
of students through access to higher-quality curriculum and coursework. 
Mr. Murray has also collaborated with the Native American community, 
most notably with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, to address their 
healthcare, housing, and infrastructure needs. In all of his time 
serving New York&#x27;s communities, Mr. Murray has been responsible for 
over $2 billion in investments towards rural development.
  Mr. Murray has optimistically taken on incredibly challenging issues 
ranging from fostering opportunities for young talent to promoting 
infrastructure, internet access, healthcare, and housing developments. 
Outside his work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural 
Development, Murray has served on the St. Lawrence County Planning 
Board for over 12 years, recently as the chairman, and is active in his 
local fire department, serving as an interior firefighter and as a 
member of the rescue squad. His commitment to serving his community 
outside of his professional life demonstrates his remarkable and 
genuine dedication to improving New York&#x27;s rural communities.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, I would like to thank and 
honor Brian Murray for his efforts to enhance the quality of life for 
members of New York&#x27;s rural communities. His dedication to public 
service is truly admirable and has made a lasting impact that will 
continue to benefit New Yorkers for years to come.

  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. 
Carl Lucas--a dedicated educational leader, proud native of Hollandale, 
Mississippi, and tireless advocate for student achievement and equity 
in education.
  Mr. Lucas began his career as a secondary mathematics teacher, where 
he created a classroom culture of rigor and relevance. His students 
consistently demonstrated significant growth on state assessments, 
earning him recognition for narrowing achievement gaps and instilling 
academic discipline.
  As Principal of Simmons High School, Mr. Lucas set a bold goal of 
earning a B rating. Through systems that raised expectations, improved 
instruction, and increased student accountability, he led the school to 
measurable gains in academic performance, graduation rates, and 
climate.
  In addition to school leadership, Mr. Lucas developed and expanded 
transformative academic programs, including:
  Dual Enrollment &amp; Career Pathways with Mississippi Delta Community 
College and Tougaloo College.
  ACT Prep Initiatives, including summer boot camps and classroom 
integration.
  Credit Recovery &amp; Summer Learning, led by certified teachers.
  Middle College Readiness Programs for college and career 
acceleration.
  Student Support Systems involving mentoring and behavior contracts.
  Mr. Lucas holds a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Mathematics and a Master&#x27;s 
Degree from Mississippi Valley State University, as well as an 
Education Specialist Degree from Belhaven University.
  He is married to his high school sweetheart, Monet Dye-Lucas, and 
together they are the proud parents of Carl&#x27;Kaisha, Carl Jr., Carlnell, 
and Carlandria.
  Mr. Lucas leads with heart, vision, and integrity. He believes every 
child deserves access to a quality education and the opportunity to 
thrive. His life&#x27;s work reflects that belief, right in the community 
that raised him.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Carl 
Lucas for his unwavering service to education and his lasting impact on 
the Mississippi Delta.

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, September 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Dave Paratore, 
owner of Dave&#x27;s Diner in Schuyler, New York, a true institution in 
Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley for more than three decades.
  Since opening its doors on January 13, 1989, Dave&#x27;s Diner has been 
more than a restaurant--it has been a gathering place for families, 
friends, and neighbors. What began as a modest 40-seat room grew into 
three dining rooms with more than 100 seats and even an ice cream 
window. For 25 years, the diner hosted Tuesday night cruise-ins, a 
beloved tradition that became a fixture of Central New York summers. 
Generations of employees passed through its doors, many starting as 
young people looking for summer jobs who went on to become teachers, 
medical professionals, engineers, and servicemembers.
  Dave himself grew up helping run his family&#x27;s Glen Motel and, with 
little restaurant experience, poured his energy and vision into 
creating a business that became part of the region&#x27;s identity. Through 
hard work, he was able to build a future for his family, send two 
children to school, and provide a home. When his wife Joanne, a retired 
Westmoreland schoolteacher, was diagnosed with cancer, Dave turned his 
diner into a force for good, raising over $10,000 for the Joseph 
Michael Chubbuck Foundation through the diner&#x27;s cruise-ins to help 
local families facing cancer.
  Beyond his business success, Dave has given back to the community in 
countless ways. His diner was a hub for America First rallies since 
2016, a place where neighbors came together not only for food but also 
for civic life and shared values. He quietly helped families in need, 
especially those struggling with illness or financial hardship, 
providing support in difficult times.
  On August 7, 2025, Dave announced that Dave&#x27;s Diner will close its 
doors on September 1st as he begins his well-earned retirement. The 
outpouring of support was extraordinary, with hundreds of comments and 
shares from people across the region who felt touched by the memories, 
meals, and kindness that Dave and his team provided over 36 years.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I am honored to 
recognize Dave Paratore for his service to his community, his 
generosity, and the enduring legacy of Dave&#x27;s Diner. His contributions 
to Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley will not be forgotten.

                       HONORING DR. JAMES DOBSON

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JEFF CRANK

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, September 3, 2025

  Mr. CRANK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the courageous, 
convictional, and influential leadership of Dr. James Dobson, who 
passed into eternity on August 21, 2025, at the age of 89. ``The 
greatest legacy one can pass on to one&#x27;s children and grandchildren is 
not money or other material things accumulated in one&#x27;s life, but 
rather a legacy of character and faith,&#x27;&#x27; wrote Dr. Billy Graham. Mr. 
Speaker, Dr. Graham&#x27;s friend and Focus on the Family founder, Dr. James 
Dobson, did just that.
  As a trusted advocate for faith, family, and biblical values, Dr. 
Dobson&#x27;s legacy is unmatched, and his life&#x27;s work continues to shape 
our nation. We were honored that he chose Colorado Springs, Colorado as 
his home and base of operations for Focus on the Family.
  Dr. James Dobson founded Focus on the Family in 1977 with the 
conviction that America&#x27;s failing families needed to return to Biblical 
principles. A licensed marriage, family and child counselor in both 
California and Colorado, Dr. Dobson authored more than 30 books, 
including the popular best-sellers Dare to Discipline, Love Must Be 
Tough, and Bringing Up Boys. Although he eventually became associate 
clinical professor of pediatrics at the USC School of Medicine, Dr. 
Dobson&#x27;s attention ultimately turned to addressing the breakdown of the 
traditional family unit. His concern led him to leave USC and in 1977 
open a small, two-room office he called Focus on the Family. That small 
ministry grew to become a global multimedia nonprofit that reaches 
about 18 million people in more than 98 countries, thanks in part to 
its Radio Hall of Fame-winning flagship program, thirteen international 
offices and many radio, video, digital and print resources.
  His wide reach through his numerous books and daily radio broadcast 
became the national voice of conservative, moral, and Biblical values 
in the public square. Dr. Dobson was a once-in-a-generation leader 
whose courage to speak truth shaped the course of American family life. 
He inspired and truly created a grass-roots movement to defend life, 
Biblical marriage, and religious freedom throughout America and around 
the world. Dr. Dobson not only built organizations like Focus on the 
Family and the Family Policy Alliance, but he also built-up people of 
faith to stand boldly for biblical values in a culture that 
increasingly opposes and demeans them.
  With unwavering conviction, he championed the sanctity of marriage, 
the dignity of life, and the importance of parental rights, principles 
woven into the DNA of our movement. My friend and current Focus on the 
Family President Jim Daly may have summarized it best in saying, 
``Millions of marriages were saved and strengthened, millions of 
parents were able to raise happier, healthier children, and millions of 
men and women were equipped and encouraged to stand boldly for their 
faith in the public square because Dr. Dobson answered God&#x27;s call to 
create Focus on the Family.&#x27;&#x27;
  I am grateful for his decades of courage and leadership to the Pikes 
Peak region, the country and the world. His belief in the power of 
civic engagement and cultural renewal still inspires many. Dr. Dobson 
emphasized the responsibility of believers to be ``salt and light&#x27;&#x27; in 
society, and we must take that charge seriously. I know I speak on 
behalf of many of my colleagues in this chamber that Dr. Dobson 
continues to inspire us to and his legacy has entrusted us to: 
advancing biblical values through civic engagement, calling on 
believers to pray, vote, and engage for a nation where God is honored, 
religious freedom flourishes, families thrive, and life is cherished.
  Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Dobson&#x27;s family, especially his 
college sweetheart and lifelong partner Shirley; his two adult 
children, Danae and Ryan; and his two grandchildren during this time of 
loss and the celebration of his life. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in thanking the Lord for his life and impact in our country 
and the world.

                      Wednesday, September 3, 2025

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Robert and 
Linda McNeill on the occasion of their 25th wedding anniversary. It is 
with great pleasure and excitement that I share this wonderful news.
  Robert, a man of integrity, loyalty, and strength, has devoted his 
life to family and loved ones. Linda, a kind and graceful soul, 
treasures her family values and cherishes every moment with those 
dearest to her.
  Fate brought Robert and his beautiful wife, Linda, together at the 
Curwood festival in Owosso, Michigan. In a serendipitous moment, as he 
picked her up, their eyes locked, and their lifelong love began. Robert 
and Linda&#x27;s story reached a cherished milestone on September 23, 2000, 
when they were united in marriage. Since then, they have raised three 
sons together and have continued to grow not just as individuals, but 
also as partners in life.
  Love and marriage represent the joining of two hearts and lives, 
built on a foundation of trust, respect, and shared dreams. Robert and 
Linda embody the promise to stand together through life&#x27;s joys and 
challenges, growing stronger as individuals and as partners. Their love 
story is a testament to the beauty of finding someone who not only 
inspires you but also walks beside you every step of the way.
  Mr. Speaker, let us all join in congratulating Robert and Linda on 
this momentous milestone and celebration of their long-lasting love. I 
wish them boundless happiness, love, and success as they continue on 
their journey together.

 HONORING THE EAST JORDAN AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE HISTORY OF

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, September 3, 2025

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 
East Jordan Area Chamber of Commerce for its continued leadership in 
hosting the 2025 Portside Art Fair, one of Northern Michigan&#x27;s most 
prestigious and long-standing artistic traditions.
  Founded in August 1962, the Portside Art Fair was the vision of a 
dedicated group of East Jordan residents who believed their community 
was the ideal setting for local artists to share their work with the 
public. What began with just 30 participants has now grown to its full 
capacity of 75, reflecting not only the fair&#x27;s increasing popularity 
but also the vibrant creativity it continues to inspire.
  Held along the beautiful shores of Lake Charlevoix, the Portside Art 
Fair honors the deep connection between our region&#x27;s natural beauty and 
the inspiration it provides to artists. It showcases the work of 
established and emerging artists from East Jordan and throughout 
Northern Michigan. Each year, a qualified judge in the visual arts 
carefully selects standout pieces to be honored with inclusion in the 
prestigious Cygred Riley Gallery at Elm Point.
  The standards for recognition at the Portside Art Fair are high, and 
the quality of submissions reflects the extraordinary talent of our 
local artists. The fair serves as a powerful reminder of the important 
role that the arts play in strengthening our communities, inspiring 
future generations, and celebrating the unique character of Northern 
Michigan.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend the East Jordan Area 
Chamber of Commerce for organizing the 2025 Portside Art Fair and for 
its unwavering support of the arts. I offer my best wishes to all 
participating artists and look forward to the continued success of this 
treasured cultural event.

                             HON. ANDY BARR

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, September 3, 2025

  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bruce Wayne 
Pieratt of Lexington, Kentucky. Mr. Pieratt passed away on August 17, 
2025, just one day after his 79th birthday.
  Mr. Pieratt was born on August 16, 1946, and raised in a loving home. 
He graduated from Lexington&#x27;s Lafayette High School. An outstanding 
athlete, he earned All-City, All-Central Kentucky, and All-State honors 
in football and attended Oklahoma State University on a football 
scholarship. He was recognized for academics on the All-Big 8 Academic 
Team. Following graduation, Mr. Pieratt returned to Lexington and 
married Patsy, his sweetheart who he met in seventh grade.
  Mr. Pieratt went to work at Pieratt&#x27;s, the family business founded in 
1946 by his father Frank, a WWII veteran. The business started as a 
radio and small appliance repair shop and rapidly expanded. Mr. Pieratt 
worked alongside his father, brothers, brother-in-law, and nephews and 
helped grow Pieratt&#x27;s into one of the most respected retailers in 
Central Kentucky. In 1988, Bruce Pieratt was named President and CEO, a 
role he held until 2021 when the company sold.
  A true patriot who loved his country and believed in serving, Mr. 
Pieratt joined the Kentucky Army National Guard in 1968. He had a long 
and distinguished military career over thirty-one years. He served 
Kentucky as Assistant Adjutant General-Army and attained the rank of 
Brigadier General.
  Mr. Pieratt was a loyal supporter of the University of Kentucky. He 
served on many boards and community organizations across Kentucky where 
his leadership was widely respected. He and his wife Patsy had three 
daughters, Nicole, Noel, and Nalise, and eight grandchildren. In a life 
filled with great accomplishments, he was most proud of his family.
  A patriotic American, a respected community leader, a family man, and 
a true friend to many, he touched countless lives. I am honored to call 
Brigadier General Bruce Pieratt my friend and to lift up his life 
before the House of Representatives.

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marie and David 
Troy of Greenwich, New York for their admirable patriotism.
  Marie Troy is a lifelong New Yorker and resident of Washington 
County. For four years now, she and her husband David Troy have 
dedicated time and effort to bringing patriotic pride back to their 
community on Memorial Day. Together the Troys line their town&#x27;s main 
streets with American flags made here in the USA by the Saratoga Flag 
Company.
  To pay for all 78 flags and the necessary hardware the Troys raised 
money through neighbors and local businesses. To install the flags, the 
Troys partnered with Veteran Mike Savage, the Middle Falls Fire 
Department, and local leaders so that the flags are all up by Memorial 
Day. Marie and David Troy are an

[[Page E806]]

example to New Yorkers and to Americans. I truly respect and admire 
them for their enthusiasm and patriotism.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, I want to thank Marie and 
David Troy for being model citizens of our community.

  Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Salvador Barajas, 
an outstanding historical muralist and visionary artist, who has worked 
tirelessly to preserve history, mental youth, and strengthen 
multicultural identity in San Diego.
  Mr. Barajas served in the United States Air Force from 1961 to 1964. 
During his service,

[[Page E807]]

he worked as a Technical Illustrator, a skill that would later 
influence his artistic career. He was recognized as a Newfoundland Air 
Force Base Boxing Champion and honorably discharged as Sergeant.
  An Associate of Arts graduate of Los Angeles Trade Technical-College, 
Mr. Barajas first became involved with Chicano Park in 1973. Since 
then, he has been a driving force in the creation, restoration, and 
preservation of its murals, negotiating with Caltrans to protect the 
park&#x27;s cultural heritage. Accordingly, he served as the Lead Artist for 
the Historical Mural Restoration Project.
  Mr. Barajas is the founder of Motivational Design and has completed 
more than 500 public art projects throughout Southern California. Some 
of his notable works include ``The Founders Mural,&#x27;&#x27; ``No Border 
Wall,&#x27;&#x27; ``Amor Si Se Puede,&#x27;&#x27; and ``Amigos Car Club,&#x27;&#x27; and many others.
  He is the recipient of multiple honors, including a Southwestern 
College Honorary Degree, inclusion in the Mexican Heritage Foundation&#x27;s 
100 Portraits: Pioneers, Visionaries and Role Models, and recognition 
as a San Diego County Library Living Well Legend.
  Mr. Barajas lives in South Park with his wife, Leticia Barajas, and 
is the proud father of four children, Xochitl, Analilia, Graciela, and 
Salvador Jr., all graduates of California universities.
  I am proud to honor Salvador Barajas as the 52nd Congressional 
District Constituent of the Month for August 2025. His work has 
inspired our community and will empower generations to come.
