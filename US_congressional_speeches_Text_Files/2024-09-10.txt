   CELEBRATING THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONGREGATION BETH ISRAEL IN 
                        HONESDALE, PENNSYLVANIA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 10, 2024

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize a remarkable and 
historic milestone for a cherished institution in the Eighth 
Congressional District of Pennsylvania: the 75th Anniversary of 
Congregation Beth Israel. Located in Honesdale, a picturesque borough 
nestled in the hills of Northeastern Pennsylvania, Congregation Beth 
Israel holds the esteemed title of being the oldest continually 
operating synagogue in America still in its original building.
  In September of 1849, amidst the backdrop of thousands moving 
westward in search of new opportunities, eleven pioneering men gathered 
in a modest home on Main Street in Honesdale. In the flickering light 
of kerosene lamps, they made a commitment that would profoundly shape 
our community. They pledged to form a Jewish congregation to serve the 
members of the Jewish faith, laying the foundation for what would 
become a beacon of faith and perseverance.
  By 1856, these visionaries celebrated the first services held in 
their new building on Court Street. This structure has withstood the 
test of time, continuing to serve as a spiritual home for generations. 
It truly is a testament to the resilience and dedication of the Jewish 
community in Honesdale.
  Today, Congregation Beth Israel remains a living symbol of 
Northeastern Pennsylvania&#x27;s rich heritage and bright future. 
Exemplifying this fact are the descendants of three of the 
congregation&#x27;s original eleven families, who continue to play an active 
role in the synagogue&#x27;s life and mission.
  As we mark this 175th Anniversary, we celebrate not just a historical 
milestone but the vibrant, enduring spirit of Congregation Beth Israel. 
The synagogue is not only a cornerstone of our community&#x27;s religious 
life but also a living testament to the dedication and faith of its 
members. The echoes of prayers and songs that fill the pews today are a 
reminder of the deep roots and unwavering commitment of this 
congregation.

[[Page E880]]

  It is with great pride and admiration that I recognize Congregation 
Beth Israel&#x27;s 175 years of contributing to our community and to the 
broader American tapestry of religious and cultural diversity. The 
history and ongoing vitality of this institution serve as a powerful 
reminder of the strength and unity found in faith and community.
  I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Congregation Beth Israel on 
this historic anniversary. I thank them for all they have done and 
continue to do for the Jewish community of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Eighth 
Congressional District. May their congregation continue to thrive and 
inspire for many years to come.

                          ____________________

  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Genrietta 
Churbanova, a Little Rock native.
  Genrietta was named Princeton&#x27;s 2024 valedictorian, not solely for 
ranking the top of her class, but embodying the absolute best Princeton 
has to offer.
  Joao Biehl, Chairman of Princeton&#x27;s anthropology department, agrees 
that she is the most exceptional student that has come through his 
department in the last two decades.
  Genrietta was also named as Schwarzman Scholar for 2024, which is 
awarded to those who want to deepen their understanding about China&#x27;s 
political, business, and technological impact on the rest of the world.
  Genrietta stated that growing up in Arkansas kept her grounded and 
helped enable her to go far and achieve her goals.
  I am proud to call Genrietta an Arkansan. Her accomplishments and 
drive have made her more than deserving of this honor, and I am eager 
to watch her journey in the years to come.

and vibrant culture of Yazoo County to state officials and legislators.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring David Peyton 
for his exceptional achievements, steadfast leadership, and dedicated

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 10, 2024

  Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
selfless service and incredible accomplishments of Dr. Calvin Moon, a 
United States Navy Veteran, who passed earlier this month.
  Born in Yardville, Calvin spent his life in southern New Jersey. 
After graduating from Bordentown High School, he served in the United 
States Navy Submarine Service as a Petty Officer First Class Radar 
Operator on the Razorback Submarine in World War II. His bravery during 
his service played an integral role on the Pacific Front. After his 
service, he returned to New Jersey and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 
agricultural research from Rutgers University. Calvin then continued 
his studies at the University of Pennsylvania earning a doctorate of 
veterinary medicine in 1952.
  Calvin was also a devoted veterinarian practicing in his hometown. 
While he began his career at the Wood Veterinary Hospital, he later 
helped launch the Hamilton Veterinary Hospital. Additionally, Calvin 
was a key player in establishing the Columbus Central Veterinary 
Hospital and served 20 years as their Medical Director, in addition to 
his service as a diplomat with the American Board of Veterinary 
Practitioners. His devotion to ensuring the beloved pets of families 
were taken care of was an inspiration to all those who knew him.
  Outside his professional work, Calvin was an active member of his 
community. Having served on the Northern Burlington High School Board 
of Education and as scoutmaster for Troop 55 in Crosswicks, Calvin 
received the Father of the Year Award in Chesterfield, New Jersey. In 
addition to all those contributions, he was also a radio operator for 
Mercer County Emergency Service, a member of the Rutgers Oral History 
Society, the Base Commander of the New Jersey South Submarine Veterans, 
and Honorary Life Member of the USS Razorback Association. I commend 
him for his deep roots in our community, and for his desire to uplift 
youth, veterans, and all of his neighbors.
  Calvin was, at his core, a loving husband to June Ann Moon. In their 
76 years of marriage, the Moons had four children, seven grandchildren, 
and now five great-grandchildren.
  While many community members locally know Calvin and his positive 
impact in our community, today I&#x27;m proud to honor his tenure as a 
veteran of the United States Navy, a valued member of our community, 
and as a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. We are 
fortunate to be able to carry on his legacy of service and to have his 
life&#x27;s work as inspiration in our community.

busted pipes, and inoperable hot water heaters. Dr. Davis sent a 
generous donation to the Salvation Army and AJFC agency.

treating them to dinner and providing donations and gift cards to the 
members.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Marie 
Davis for her actions and achievements in the Natchez, MS community.

                      Tuesday, September 10, 2024

  Mr. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. 
Anne B. Kerr, who recently retired from her role as the 17th president 
of Florida Southern College. Her dedication to academic excellence and 
a quality campus life experience transformed Florida Southern into one 
of the best liberal arts colleges in the South.
  Dr. Kerr developed her interest in education during her psychology 
studies at Mercer University. She then earned a master&#x27;s degree in 
counseling and a doctorate in higher education administration from 
Florida State University. Prior to her tenure at Florida Southern, Dr. 
Kerr held executive roles at Rollins College and the University of 
Central Florida before serving as the University of Richmond&#x27;s Vice 
President for Institutional Advancement.
  Dr. Kerr&#x27;s 20-year tenure as Florida Southern College&#x27;s 17th 
president was the second-longest in the school&#x27;s history. Her steadfast 
leadership yielded the college&#x27;s highest enrollment numbers and 
academic ranking. The college became a top producer of Fulbright 
Scholars in the Nation, a prestigious scholarship for students pursuing 
studies abroad. To house Florida Southern&#x27;s monumental growth, the 
college added 22 new buildings, expanded 20 others and restored many of 
the famed Frank Lloyd Wright buildings.
  Dr. Kerr also helped expand Florida Southern&#x27;s academic offerings by 
adding 19 new graduate degree programs, including the Barney Barnett 
School of Business and Economics, the first named school on campus. 
Other new programs were added in accounting, education, nursing and 
physical therapy. On the eve of her retirement, she also announced the 
emergence of a new undergraduate architecture program, with a graduate 
program to follow in 2028.
  Dr. Kerr declared at the start of her tenure she wanted FSC to be 
``recognized as one of the nation&#x27;s small, preeminent colleges.&#x27;&#x27; It is 
safe to say she exceeded her vision. Dr. Kerr&#x27;s success was driven by 
her faith and the fulfillment brought by seeing her students achieve 
their dreams. We are lucky she intends to continue to inspire future 
generations, returning to Florida Southern in Spring 2025 to teach a 
leadership course in the Barnett School of Business.
  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kerr&#x27;s accomplishments and passion for students is 
an inspiration to us all. I urge my colleagues to join me in wishing 
her an enjoyable and well-deserved retirement.

  Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the 75th 
anniversary of Jefferson High School.
  Established in 1949, under the leadership of its first principal, Mr. 
J.M. Whitaker. Jefferson High School has been the institution that has 
provided an excellent education to generations of students from the 
South-Central community. Better known as the `Silver Foxes,&#x27; students 
and alumni proudly represent Jefferson all throughout El Paso, the 
country, and the world. From Ricardo Samaniego, our El Paso County 
Judge, Alberto Almanza, an Olympian who competed in 1960 and 1964, and 
numerous of veterans and servicemembers who have served in all branches 
of the military in pursuit of liberty and justice. Jefferson has a

are always proud of their community and where they come from.

  I would also like to recognize all the teachers, faculty, and staff 
of Jefferson for their dedication and tireless work to enrich the lives 
of students, empower them to become productive citizens, and leaders in 
their communities. It takes a village to educate and raise children and 
without their work, Jefferson High School would not be able to operate.
  I ask all Members to join me today in honoring Jefferson High School 
for their 75 years of educational excellence and its profound impact on 
the lives of countless students, families, and the broader community. 
Long live Jeff (Viva la Jeff).

                          ____________________

            HONORING THE LEGACY OF CONGRESSMAN BILL PASCRELL

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MIKE CAREY

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 10, 2024

  Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Congressman Bill 
Pascrell, who passed away last month after serving nearly three decades 
in Congress.
  It was a privilege to serve alongside Bill on the Ways &amp; Means 
Committee. Though we sat on different sides of the aisle, Bill&#x27;s 
warmth, humor and dedication to his constituents can be a source of 
inspiration for all of us.
  Bill was born in Paterson, New Jersey. America&#x27;s first industrial 
city. Through the years he saw his community grow and change, but like 
the city&#x27;s great falls, he remained a steadfast engine for progress.
  I got to know Bill during events with the Italian American caucus, 
where we could talk about our shared heritage over glasses of Primitivo 
and Montepulciano. In the spirit of those days, I would like to share a 
message in memory of this great man and his legacy:
  ``My friend, you will not be forgotten. (Amico mio, non sarai 
dimenticato).&#x27;&#x27;

                    REMEMBERING BENTLEY HIGH SCHOOL

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RASHIDA TLAIB

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 10, 2024

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize Bentley High 
School, Livonia&#x27;s first public high school. While the building no 
longer exists in its physical form, its space holds many special 
memories for many of the 12th Congressional District residents and 
alumni.
  Livonia Township experienced population growth in the 1940s, which 
drove home the need for its own public high school. Before then, its 
school-aged population was served by seven small school districts 
without a high school. With the people&#x27;s approval, construction of the 
new high school began on November 8, 1946. The school was named for 
school board president George N. Bentley, and it hosted its first 
classes on September 15, 1947, in spite of ongoing construction. 
Ninety-five students comprised the school&#x27;s first graduating class on 
June 15, 1950, just a few weeks after Livonia was incorporated as a 
city.
  Over the ensuing years, Bentley High School was expanded multiple 
times to accommodate the changing needs of a growing student body. The 
school proudly boasted an extensive library, wood shop, auto shop, 
swimming pool, and music rooms. Due to declining population, Bentley 
High School was closed in 1984, though it lived on a community center 
until 1999.
  Please join me and the 12th Congressional District in recognizing 
Bentley High School, as the community of Livonia and alumni celebrate 
the legacy and memories of this historic place.
