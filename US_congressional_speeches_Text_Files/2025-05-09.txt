   DHS RESTRICTIONS ON CONFUCIUS INSTITUTES AND CHINESE ENTITIES OF 
                              CONCERN ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Wednesday, May 7, 2025

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 881, the DHS 
Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern 
Act.
  H.R. 881 is a solution in search of a problem. In 2018, Congress 
passed provisions prohibiting the Department of Defense from providing 
funds to any U.S. institution of higher education that hosts a 
Confucius Institute, unless that institution receives a waiver from the 
Department. Since its passage, no waivers have been issued, and the 
number of Confucius Institutes in the United States has declined from a 
peak of 118 in 2017 to fewer than five today. The current protections 
against Chinese intellectual property theft through Confucius 
Institutes have worked, and Congress should not place additional 
burdens on our colleges, universities, and their students.
  Mr. Speaker, instead of addressing the harms of the President&#x27;s on-
again-off-again tariffs, or working to address rising costs for 
American consumers, Republicans used this week to negotiate their 
Reckless Budget Scheme and rename a body of water. My constituents do 
not want Congress to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts to 
billionaires. They do not want cuts to SNAP or Medicaid, vital 
lifelines in my home state of Minnesota. It&#x27;s time Congress starts 
working to address the real issues--starting with passing full year 
appropriations bills. I am ready to get to work.

                  HONORING THE LIFE OF DIANE RAULSTON

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. EUGENE SIMON VINDMAN

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 9, 2025

  Mr. VINDMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary 
life and service of Diane Raulston, a devoted public servant, community 
leader, and advocate for education in Prince William County, Virginia.
  Diane Raulston served the residents of the Neabsco District with 
distinction on the Prince William County School Board from 2015 to 
2023. Throughout her years of service, she was a passionate and 
determined advocate for public education, promoting efforts to raise 
teacher pay, close opportunity gaps, and create a more equitable, 
student-centered school system.
  Under Diane Raulston&#x27;s leadership. the school division made 
meaningful strides: graduation rates rose, access to pre-kindergarten 
expanded, and Career and Technical Education programs grew 
significantly. Her steady support helped guide the opening of nine new 
schools to meet the demands of a growing student population, ensuring 
that every child had a safe and welcoming place to learn.
  Beyond her official role, Diane was known for her kindness, 
determination, and unwavering belief in the power of public education 
to uplift communities. She listened, she acted, and she made a 
difference in countless lives. Her legacy is not only visible in the 
buildings and programs she helped establish, but also in the spirit of 
service she inspired in others.
  As we remember Diane Raulston, we celebrate a life lived in service 
to others, a life marked by integrity, compassion, and impact. Her 
passing is a profound loss for our community, but her contributions 
will endure for generations to come.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Diane 
Raulston&#x27;s remarkable life. May her legacy of service and her devotion 
to educational equity continue to inspire and guide our efforts.

                          ____________________

            HONORING U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENT TRAVIS W. SALO

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL BAUMGARTNER

                             of washington

                    in the house of representatives

                          Friday, May 9, 2025

  Mr. BAUMGARTNER. Mr. Speaker, behind every badge is a story, a 
family, and a heart committed to service. I rise today with a heavy 
heart to honor the life of Border Patrol Agent Travis W. Salo, who 
tragically passed on April 25th in an off-duty vehicle accident near 
Metaline, in Pend Oreille County. He was just 36 years old--a life full 
of promise, commitment, and courage, taken far too soon.
  Agent Salo was more than just a dedicated public servant--he was a 
protector of our Nation&#x27;s borders, a proud member of the U.S. Border 
Patrol&#x27;s Spokane Sector, and a valued agent assigned to the Metaline 
Falls Station. He carried out his duties with integrity, honor, and 
quiet strength. Those who served alongside him remember him not only 
for his professionalism, but for the kindness, loyalty, and sense of 
duty he brought to every shift.
  His sudden passing is a painful reminder of the risks and sacrifices 
that the men and women in law enforcement face--both on and off duty. 
Agent Salo&#x27;s story is one of dedication, bravery, and selflessness.
  Today, we pause not only to mourn his loss, but to celebrate his life 
and express our gratitude. He leaves behind a legacy of service that 
will not be forgotten.
  To his family, friends, and fellow agents, I extend my most heartfelt 
condolences. May they find comfort in knowing that his life made a 
difference, and that his memory will continue to inspire us all.

                          ____________________
