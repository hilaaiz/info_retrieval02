             CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF BARBARA LEONARD HAYES

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. PAT FALLON

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2025

  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Mrs. 
Barbara Leonard Hayes of Carrollton, Texas, who peacefully passed away 
on April 6, 2025.
  Barbara was born on July 8, 1937, in Tom, Oklahoma and was adopted by 
John and Lena Noll Leonard. She attended Durant High School and 
graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1958, where she earned her 
bachelor&#x27;s degree in education. Barbara began her career as a Flight 
Attendant for American Airlines out of Chicago, where she was 
recognized in the World Book Encyclopedia for her unique, vintage title 
of ``Airline Stewardess.&#x27;&#x27; Soon after, she moved to Sherman to begin 
teaching elementary education at Sherman ISD. On June 11, 1960, Barbara 
married the love of her life, Stanley Joe Hayes, in Durant, Oklahoma. 
Together, they raised two children and have many more grandchildren.
  In addition to her critical work as an educator, Barbara was involved 
in many community initiatives throughout North Texas. She served as the 
PTA President at Wakefield Elementary, Cub Scout leader and Den Mother, 
and a member of many civic and philanthropic organizations. Barbara was 
also very passionate about rescuing animals, traveling, and most 
importantly, trusting God. She was a devoted woman of faith and a 
member of the First Presbyterian Church in Sherman, now the Covenant 
Presbyterian Church. The kindness, joy, and warmth that Barbara brought 
with her presence will always be remembered by her loved ones.
  I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation&#x27;s 
Capitol in recognition of Barbara&#x27;s life and contributions to North 
Texas. She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who 
knew her.

                          ____________________

                                 ______

                         Thursday, June 5, 2025

  Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 75th 
anniversary of the VA Medical Center in Manchester, New Hampshire and 
in celebration of 75 years of unwavering commitment to veteran health 
care.
  At the end of World War I, citizens of New Hampshire began advocating 
for a local veterans hospital in order to properly honor Granite 
Staters who bravely served their country. After an extensive and hard-
fought campaign that made it all the way to Congress, the hospital was 
granted approval and opened its doors on July 2, 1950.
  For 75 years, the Manchester VA has provided compassionate care to 
countless veterans and their families. From physical therapy to mental 
health care, the Manchester VA&#x27;s comprehensive services help many 
veterans to live happy and healthy lives. The dedicated VA staff create 
a supportive and encouraging environment where veterans feel empowered 
to seek the medical help they need.
  Guided by the needs of veterans and their families, the Manchester VA 
remains committed to holistic treatment. The Manchester VA&#x27;s research 
program is internationally recognized for the study and treatment of 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other serious mental health 
challenges. A renowned teaching hospital, the Manchester VA actively

[[Page E533]]

trains the next generation of caregivers to ensure that their important 
work continues for years to come.
  On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire&#x27;s First Congressional 
District, I want to congratulate the Manchester VA on 75 years of 
devoted service to veterans and their families. We are grateful for 
your commitment to our community&#x27;s veterans and I look forward to 
continuing to support this vital work.

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable young man from 
my district, Ahmari Taylor, a vital member of the Walter H. Dyett High 
School for the Arts boys&#x27; basketball team, the Eagles. This team 
achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School 
Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 
win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025.
  This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a 
profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the 
Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood. A 
decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful 
community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open. 
Today, the Eagles&#x27; triumph, in which Ahmari Taylor played a crucial 
role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a 
community invests in its youth and its institutions.
  Ahmari Taylor, along with his teammates, demonstrated exceptional 
skill, discipline, and teamwork throughout their season, navigating 
challenges and competing at the highest level. His hard work and 
dedication were integral to the team&#x27;s success, culminating in this 
well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to his 
school, family, and the entire community.
  I also extend my deepest gratitude to Head Coach Jamaal Gill, whose 
visionary leadership and guidance steered the team to this historic 
victory, and to Assistant Coaches Kimani Harris, Pierre Adams, and 
Nathan Townsen, Jr., whose mentorship was vital to the players&#x27; 
development.
  Mr. Speaker, Ahmari Taylor&#x27;s contribution to the Dyett Eagles&#x27; 
journey from near closure to state champions is an inspiring narrative 
for us all. It underscores the critical importance of supporting our 
public schools and investing in programs that empower young people to 
achieve their fullest potential. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating Ahmari Taylor and the entire Dyett High School boys&#x27; 
basketball team on their momentous achievement and honoring them for 
the inspiration they provide to communities across our Nation.

need.

                        HONORING SORAYDA SANTOS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JUAN VARGAS

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2025

  Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sorayda Santos as 
California&#x27;s 52nd Congressional District Constituent of the Month for 
January 2025.
  Sorayda is the co-chair of the nationally recognized Hermanitas 
Program at MANA de San Diego, which empowers Latina middle and high 
school students to reach their highest potential. This program pairs 
each student with a dedicated mentor to help guide them, inspire them, 
and provide them with the support they need to succeed.
  During her three years as co-chair of the Hermanitas Program, Sorayda 
has increased the cohort size, improved seminar offerings, and built 
lasting partnerships with community organizations. Sorayda has also led 
efforts to bring a new project management seminar to the program, 
giving students a valuable, hands-on learning experience that will 
benefit them for years to come.
  In addition to leading the Hermanitas Program, Sorayda currently 
mentors an eighth-grade student, demonstrating an unwavering commitment 
to giving back.
  Sorayda is an exceptional leader and mentor who works hard every day 
to inspire the next generation of Latinas to dream big and achieve 
greatness. I can&#x27;t think of a better person to have recognized during 
National Mentorship Month.

                         Thursday, June 5, 2025

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Golden Police 
Department of Golden, Colorado, for serving and protecting our 
community.
  We are all grateful to the Department and Chief of Police Joe Harvey, 
as they strive to maintain a culture of positive public engagement, 
equity, and compassion for all. Founded in 1874, the department has a 
long history of dedicated officers working to build public trust 
through accountability and equitable policing.
  National Police Week offers an opportunity to honor law enforcement 
and pay tribute to those who gave their lives serving their 
communities. This week, we honor Officer Evan Dunn, who was a member of 
the Golden Police Department, who tragically passed away in the line of 
duty in November 2024. Officer Dunn joined the Department after serving 
as an Army Aviator and Black Hawk pilot in the Missouri and Colorado 
Army National Guard. As a soldier, an officer, and a devoted husband, 
Officer Dunn was a servant in every aspect of his life. His legacy of 
kindness, dedication, and service to our community and our country will 
not be forgotten.
  On behalf of the people of Colorado&#x27;s Seventh Congressional District, 
it is my honor to thank the Golden Police Department for their devotion 
to public service in the line of duty.
