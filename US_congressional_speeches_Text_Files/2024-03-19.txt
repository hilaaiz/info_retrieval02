                       CELEBRATING JANIE BARRERA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. GREG CASAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Mr. CASAR. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to call the attention of the 
House in celebration of a true Texas visionary, Ms. Janie Barrera, for 
decades of work to provide small business owners and working families 
with the means to achieve their dreams.
  A native of Corpus Christi and a sixth-generation Texan, Ms. 
Barrera&#x27;s entrepreneurial spirit began in her youth. At the age of 12, 
after her mother denied her request to purchase a new bicycle, Janie 
went door-to-door selling raffle tickets for her old bicycle and used 
the proceeds to purchase a new one. Later, as a waitress in her 
parents&#x27; restaurant, Ms. Barrera witnessed both the hard work and the 
great financial risks of running a small business.
  After high school, Ms. Barrera became a nun and joined a local 
covenant. She ran the Telecommunications Center for the Diocese of 
Corpus Christi for 15 years. When a bishop told Ms. Barrera that she 
couldn&#x27;t get a promotion because of her lack of business experience, 
she pursued a Master of Business Administration from the University of 
the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas. She left the covenant shortly 
after graduation.
  Ms. Barrera&#x27;s parents ended up with nothing saved for retirement 
after running their restaurant for 20 years. This motivated her to use 
her personal experience and academic training to support both small 
businesses and working families. In 1994, Ms. Barrera founded Accion 
Texas (later renamed LiftFund) with the commitment to provide small 
businesses with sorely needed financial support through microloans and 
ongoing guidance as they navigated complex financial systems.
  Today, LiftFund has over 100 employees and has disbursed close to 
$500 million to small business owners in underserved communities, 
particularly people of color and low- and moderate-income individuals. 
Ms. Barrera stepped down as CEO of LiftFund in 2023 after three 
decades.
  Ms. Barrera has been an integral part of the creation and 
sustainability of countless small businesses. Her work has received 
high recognition in Texas and beyond, including the ``Small Business 
Administration Financial Services Advocate of the Year,&#x27;&#x27; and the 
``Minority Enterprise Development Consortium&#x27;s Corporate Advocate of 
the Year.&#x27;&#x27; She received the 2022 Ned Gramlich Lifetime Achievement 
Award for Responsible Finance, which is the Community Development 
Financial Institution industry&#x27;s highest individual honor. Ms. Barrera 
has also served on boards of directors at various levels, including the 
Federal Reserve Board&#x27;s National Consumer Advisory Council. An 
invaluable leader in her field, President Barack Obama appointed Ms. 
Barrera to the President&#x27;s Advisory Council on Financial Capability.

[[Page E263]]

  As Texans, we are all forever grateful to Ms. Barrera for her vision 
of shared prosperity, her decades-long service to creating economic 
mobility, and her unwavering dedication to our community. As the 
Congressman for the 35th District of Texas, I am proud to congratulate 
Ms. Barrera and LiftFund on 30 years of service in Texas, and beyond.

                          ____________________

                COMMEMORATING JAMES SOLOMON RUSSELL DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. JENNIFER L. McCLELLAN

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Ms. McCLELLAN. Mr. Speaker, the Virginia General Assembly proclaimed 
March 28th as James Solomon Russell Day. Today, I use to honor his 
legacy and incredible contributions to our Commonwealth.
  Born enslaved in 1857, James Solomon Russell&#x27;s life journey 
exemplifies resilience and determination. After receiving his teaching 
license in Warren County, North Carolina, and beginning to teach in the 
area, he attended Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in 1874. 
However, due to financial difficulties, he was unable to complete his 
studies and returned to teach in Warren County.
  Thereafter, he became interested in the Episcopal Church and was the 
fist student at Saint Stephen&#x27;s Normal and Industrial School (later 
Bishop Payne Divinity School) in Petersburg, VA. He dedicated himself 
to uplifting his community and worked among Zion Union members in 
Brunswick County. His tireless efforts included the establishment of 
schools, senior housing, and the founding of Saint Paul&#x27;s College in 
1888. Through his leadership, thousands of African American youth were 
empowered to pursue education, becoming beacons of progress across the 
Commonwealth.
  Despite closing its doors in 2013, James Solomon Russell&#x27;s indelible 
mark at Saint Paul&#x27;s College is kept alive at the James Solomon 
Russell--Saint Paul&#x27;s College Museum and Archives in Lawrenceville, 
Virginia. I commend the James Solomon Russell Commemoration Committee 
and the Saint Paul&#x27;s College Museum Committee for spearheading the 
community effort to open the museum to the public in 2019.
  Moreover, I extend my deepest appreciation to the Smithsonian 
Institution&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture 
Robert F. Smith Center for the Digitization and Curation of African 
American History. Their collaboration with the James Solomon Russell--
Saint Paul&#x27;s College Museum and Archives is invaluable. The Center&#x27;s 
expertise in archiving and digitizing historical records ensures that 
Russell&#x27;s story, along with the rich

history of Saint Paul&#x27;s College, remains accessible to future 
generations.

          HONONNG DR. RONALD VAUGHN AND HIS EXCEPTIONAL CAREER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. KATHY CASTOR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the career 
and service of Dr. Ronald Vaughn, president of the University of Tampa. 
Throughout his 28 years of leadership with the University of Tampa, Dr. 
Vaughn has lifted students, faculty, the university, and the Tampa Bay 
community. He spearheaded a remarkable turnaround for the university 
and leaves UT ranked among the best medium-sized private universities 
in America.
  Dr. Vaughn&#x27;s remarkable career, his lifelong commitment to education, 
and exceptional stewardship of the University of Tampa have propelled 
the school into being an academic powerhouse. During his tenure as 
president, the school&#x27;s academic offerings and footprint grew into the 
dynamic, community-connected institution that we are proud of today. 
Dr. Vaughn embraced the history of the historic Tampa Bay Hotel, Plant 
Hall and the iconic minarets and infused the university with life and 
amenities for students including an expanded campus with 71 
construction projects completed or underway and investments worth a 
total of $950 million.
  The University of Tampa now hosts students from all 50 states and 
from almost all 195 countries. Dr. Vaughn&#x27;s leadership has been 
fundamental to achieving academic excellence with a unique 
entrepreneurial spirit.
  Dr. Vaughn&#x27;s academic journey is a model for my others--a B.A and an 
MBA from Indiana State University, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree 
from the University of Georgia. Dr. Vaughn&#x27;s comprehensive career as a 
business owner of a multi-office marketing research and consulting 
company provided him with the skills to lead the university into the 
established institution we know today.
  His journey with the University of Tampa started in August 1984 as 
the Coordinator of the Marketing Department and holder of the Max H. 
Hollingsworth Endowed Chair of American Enterprise. Dr. Vaughn 
subsequently served as Director of the MBA Program, Dean of the College 
of Business and Graduate Studies and Co-Chief Academic Officer. In 
January of 1995 he became the president of the university.
  Dr. Vaughn and UT hosted President Barack Obama and Vice President 
Joe Biden in 2010 for a major economic policy announcement and a visit 
with students--the first time in UT&#x27;s history that a sitting President 
made an official visit to the UT campus, and a rare joint appearance. 
President Joe Biden also visited the campus in 2023, the day after his 
State of the Union address, with many students watching from the pool 
deck and one noting ``pretty cool vibes.&#x27;&#x27; As Vice President, Joe Biden 
also made a major international affairs speech in the Fletcher Lounge 
to Bay area business leaders in 2016.
  Beyond his work as president of the university, Dr. Vaughn and his 
wife, Renee Vaughn, have been active members of the community. He has 
served on numerous boards and leadership positions, including the Straz 
Center for the Performing Arts, the Gulf Ridge Council of the Boy 
Scouts, the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce, and the Florida 
Aquarium.
  Dr. Vaughn has received numerous honors in recognition of his 
lifelong commitment to education and his exceptional stewardship of the 
University of Tampa. Among the countless awards that have been bestowed 
upon him nationally as well as locally are the Hillsborough County 
Administrative Volunteer of the Year for Tampa Bay&#x27;s Chapter of the 
American Red Cross and the prestigious national recognition by the 
Ellis Island Honors Society in 2004. Furthermore, the multi-purpose 
Vaughn Center facility is named in his honor, and it serves as the hub 
of student life and activity on the University of Tampa campus.
  As we congratulate Dr. Vaughn for his remarkable career, we also 
express our gratitude for his continued commitment to uplifting the 
youth and laying the groundwork for a better tomorrow. Dr. Vaughn is 
the definition of a true public servant. On behalf of my neighbors 
across the Tampa Bay area, the great State of Florida, and our Nation, 
I thank Dr. Vaughn for his years of dedicated service and tireless 
commitment to making the University of Tampa the dynamic and growing 
university it is today.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our 
gratitude sending best wishes to Dr. Vaughn and his family in their 
future endeavors.

                                 ______

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today 
to commemorate the life of Mrs. Audrey Burgette. Mrs. Audrey lived a 
life of selflessness, service, and desire to better her community. 
There are individuals whose impact transcends time, leaving an 
indelible mark on those fortunate enough to have known them. Audrey 
June (Stewart) Burgette, the first Black female graduate of William 
Jewell College, was one of these special people.
  Audrey Burgette was born in Liberty, Missouri on July 18, 1930. The 
circumstances of her childhood were a reflection of the times--Liberty 
was a racially segregated community still in the grips of Jim Crow 
laws. Her early educational years were also plagued by second-class 
treatment due to her race. This was before the Brown v. Board of 
Education ruling, so her schooling occurred under less than ideal 
conditions. She grew up in a supportive African American community and 
a loving family, which bolstered her to remain steadfast in her put 
suit of academic excellence and personal growth. As a testament to 
this, she graduated as Valedictorian of her class at Garrison School in 
Liberty.
  Throughout her life, Audrey stood as a beacon of resilience and 
determination for overcoming numerous challenges. In her early 20s, she 
married John West Stapleton and welcomed two children, Carrie Eileen 
Stapleton and John West Stapleton, Jr., Esq. At the young age of 25, 
she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and was partially paralyzed 
by the disease. She battled back and regained her ability to walk, only 
to face the pain of divorce. Fortunately, she found love once again 
with Herbert Lee Burgette, a Korean War veteran from Kansas City. 
Together with Herbert, Audrey welcomed two more children into her 
loving embrace, the late Dr. Phillip Leroy Burgette, M.D., and Brigitte 
Burgette Bradley, Esq. Love was always present in her blended family&#x27;s 
lives. Even though she and John were divorced, her second husband, 
Herbert, would sometimes connect with John Sr., a disabled war veteran, 
and offer to drive him to milestone events in Carrie and John Jr.&#x27;s 
lives, such as graduations and sporting events.
  While raising four children under the age of 10, Audrey was 
unrelenting in her quest for education. She achieved her dream of 
attending and graduating from William Jewell College with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Elementary Education in 1966. She later earned a Master of Arts 
in Education from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 1972.
  Audrey&#x27;s dedication to education extended beyond her own academic 
pursuits. She was a revered elementary school teacher and counselor in 
the Kansas City MO School District for over 26 years. She touched the 
lives of countless children, Instilling in them a passion for learning 
and a belief in their own potential. This commitment expanded beyond 
her professional life. Audrey became a foster parent to several young 
people during this time, giving them the same love and support she 
showed for her own students and children.
  Audrey&#x27;s commitment to excellence in education has also shaped the 
lives of her four children in profound ways, guiding them towards 
fulfilling their dreams and aspirations. They were inspired by her 
example to achieve great success in various fields, from law to 
medicine to public relations. Her legacy lives on through her three 
grandchildren, Carrie Nicole Randle, Langston Colin Taylor Burgette and 
Brandon Byron Hays; and one great-granddaughter, Nya Simone Payne. 
Carrie Nicole holds a master&#x27;s degree and is pursuing a doctorate.
  In the community, Audrey was an active member of the Kansas City 
Chapter of the National Association of Business and Professional 
Women&#x27;s Clubs, Inc., for which she was an officeholder and served on 
several committees. She was also a charter member of the Kansas City 
Chapter of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and 
History, which was established in 1979 by the Black Archives of Mid-
America, Inc. Later in life, she added entrepreneur to her list of 
endeavors--she owned and operated a successful small business, the 
Stuart House of Maids.
  Her relationship with Christ was a central force in her life with one 
ultimate goal: to give Jesus the glory. She was a member of Liberty&#x27;s 
St. Luke A.M.E. Church, and later found her spiritual home at the Unity 
Church of New Life in Kansas City. She also wanted her children to put 
Jesus first . . . every Christmas Eve, her family would celebrate by 
holding a birthday party for Jesus with a cake with one candle, singing 
Happy Birthday to him, making sure they knew the real meaning of 
Christmas.
  In 1986, the Urban League of Greater Kansas City&#x27;s Black Family 
Recognition Committee honored the Burgette-Stapleton Family as a Model 
Black Family, recognizing them for their ``sterling qualities or 
support, love, sharing, stability, nurturing, and the ability to 
overcome adversity.&#x27;&#x27;
  Tragically, Audrey&#x27;s life was cut short by cancer at the age of 62. 
Her passing left a void in the hearts of all who knew her, but her 
spirit of love, laughter, and dedication to education continues to 
inspire all who were touched by her presence. Her unwavering support 
for her family and community endures--a shining example of the 
transformative power of a life lived with purpose, perseverance, and 
passion
  As we remember Audrey June Burgette, we honor her trailblazing 
spirit, her commitment to education, and her profound impact on all of 
those whose lives she touched As Audrey herself said in a letter to her 
daughter in 1983, ``Remember to love all people, places, things, and 
mainly yourself. With love you need nothing else, but without it you 
have nothing else.&#x27;&#x27; Mr. Speaker, let us rise today and honor Audrey&#x27;s 
life and legacy. May her memory continue to inspire future generations 
to embrace challenges with courage to pursue their dreams with 
determination, and to always strive for excellence in all endeavors. 
Audrey June Brigette, a pioneer in education and a mother 
extraordinaire, will forever hold a special place in our hearts and in 
local history.

                EMPLOYEES SERVING IN SENSITIVE POSITIONS

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill to clarify certain 
due process rights of federal employees serving in sensitive positions. 
This bill would overturn an unprecedented federal court decision, 
Kaplan v. Conyers and MSPB, that stripped many federal employees of the 
light to independent review of an agency decision removing them from 
their jobs on grounds of ineligibility. The case was brought by two 
Department of Defense (DOD) employees, Rhonda Conyers, an accounting 
technician, and Devon Northover, a commissary management specialist, 
who were permanently demoted and suspended from their jobs after they 
were found to be no longer eligible to serve in noncritical sensitive 
positions. In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, which 
allowed the decision to stand. This bill is cosponsored by 
Representative Andre Carson.
  Specifically, the decision prevents federal employees who are 
designated as ``noncritical sensitive&#x27;&#x27; from appealing to the Merit 
Systems Protection Board if they are removed from their jobs. 
Noncritical sensitive jobs include those that do not have access to 
classified information. The decision affects at least 200,000 DOD 
employees who are designated as noncritical sensitive. Even more 
concerning is that most federal employees could potentially lose the 
right to an independent review of an agency&#x27;s decision because of a 
rule issued by the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence that permits agency heads to 
designate most jobs in the federal government as noncritical sensitive, 
which went into effect in July 2015.
  The decision undercuts Title 5, section 7701 of the Civil Service 
Act, which ensures due process rights for federal workers, as required 
by the Constitution. Stripping employees whose work does not involve 
classified matters of the right to an independent review of an agency 
decision that removes them from their jobs opens entirely new avenues 
for unreviewable, arbitrary action or retaliation by an agency head. 
This bill would stop the use of ``national security&#x27;&#x27; to undo a vital 
component of civil service protection and of due process.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

   RECOGNIZING JULIE SHAMBARGER&#x27;S CONTRIBUTIONS RESTORING THE TIMES 
                     THEATER IN ROCHESTER, INDIANA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. RUDY YAKYM III

                               of indiana

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Mr. YAKYM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Julie Shambarger for the 
incredible work she has done to revitalize downtown Rochester, Indiana, 
by spearheading the effort to refurbish and reopen The Times Theater in 
Rochester.
  As is the case with so many venues on Main Streets across America, 
The Times Theater was an iconic symbol of Main Street Rochester before 
closing its doors in 2014.
  Rather than accept The Times Theater&#x27;s apparent fate as a project of 
the past, Julie Shambarger poured her heart and soul into the mission 
of ensuring this cherished community fixture would be open for business 
and welcome visitors once again.
  Guided by her belief that The Times Theater could be restored as the 
vibrant heart of the Rochester community, Julie marshalled the effort 
to acquire the grants and donations needed to renovate The Times 
Theater so its reopening could be not only a possibility, but a 
reality.
  Today, The Times Theater is host to not only movies but also live 
music and community events, and it has welcomed over 9,000 guests since 
reopening last February. It has elevated the cultural landscape of 
Rochester and been a beacon of artistic innovation and creative 
expression.
  At a time when many of America&#x27;s social and civic ties are fraying, 
places like The Times Theater--places the community can take pride in 
and congregate at--are all the more important.
  I and so many other Hoosiers are immensely grateful to Julie 
Shambarger for the dedicated and diligent work she has done to bring 
more energy and life back to downtown Rochester and all of Fulton 
County.
  I look forward to visiting The Times Theater again soon and seeing 
how Julie Shambarger&#x27;s efforts will continue to pay dividends in the 
years ahead.

                       TRIBUTE TO BRIAN NESTANDE

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEN CALVERT

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my 
good friend and former California State Assemblyman Brian Nestande, who 
passed away at his home in Palm Desert earlier this month. Brian was a 
dedicated leader in the Coachella Valley who has left us far too soon, 
and he will be deeply missed.
  Born in Orange County, California, on January 10, 1964, Brian was 
exposed to the world of public service and politics at an early age. 
Brian&#x27;s father, Bruce, was a staff member for then-California Governor 
Ronald Reagan and later an elected member of the State Assembly and 
Orange County Board of Supervisors. After graduating from California 
State University, Fullerton in 1991, Brian started his own political 
career by taking a position as the Deputy Campaign Manager for the 
successful congressional campaign of Michael Buffington in Santa 
Barbara County. A few years later, Brian managed then-Palm Springs 
Mayor Sonny Bono&#x27;s congressional campaign, which was also successful. 
He went on to serve as Sonny&#x27;s Chief of Staff. In 1998, it was Brian 
who made the unforgettable phone call to me to share the shocking and 
tragic news of Sonny&#x27;s death.
  After Sonny&#x27;s passing, Brian went on to serve as Chief of Staff to 
Congresswoman Mary Bono from 1998 until 2000. He launched a government 
affairs consulting business named Nestande and Associates, and worked 
collaboratively with clients on alternative energy and healthcare 
issues. In 2008, Brian&#x27;s own name was on the ballot for the first time 
and he was elected to the California State Assembly, where he would 
serve until 2014. In Sacramento, Brian was a tireless advocate for the 
Coachella Valley and Riverside County, working on important local 
issues like the Salton Sea and improving our infrastructure. After his 
time in the Assembly, Brian joined the County of Riverside where he 
served as Deputy CEO, coordinating legislative priorities with state 
and federal representatives in the region.
  Brian is survived by his wife Gina; his son Hayden; his daughter 
Sophia; and his stepchildren Sadie, Tad, Mason, Molly and Savana. I 
extend my personal and heartfelt condolences to the Nestande family, 
his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Brian. Although he 
may be gone, the many contributions he made to his community and family 
have left an enduring legacy.

     TRIBUTE TO PETER ANDREW STURROCK, PH.D. ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ANNA G. ESHOO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Tuesday, March 19, 2024

  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Peter Andrew Sturrock, 
Ph.D., who celebrates the centennial of his birth on March 20, 2024.
  Dr. Sturrock grew up in Essex, England and studied at Palmers School, 
Grays, Essex, where his favorite subject was mathematics. He studied 
mathematics at Cambridge University, then helped develop radar systems 
at what is now the Royal Radar Establishment. He earned a scholarship 
to St. John&#x27;s College where he was elected to a fellowship.
  Dr. Sturrock then pursued work in electron physics at the Cavendish 
Laboratory, Cambridge, the National Bureau of Standards, and the Ecole 
Normale Superieure at the University of Paris.
  In 1951, Dr. Sturrock earned his Ph.D in astrophysics. He researched 
nuclear physics at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment; plasma 
physics at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge; microwave tubes at Stanford 
University; and accelerator physics at the European Organization for 
Nuclear Research. He invented a number of implements, including a novel 
microwave tube later dubbed the ``Free electron laser.&#x27;&#x27;
  In 1961, Dr. Sturrock was appointed Professor of Applied Physics at 
Stanford University, where he lived for nearly 40 years with his wife 
Marilyn. He is Emeritus Professor of Applied Physics at Stanford and 
Emeritus Director of the Center for Space Science and Astrophysics. In 
1990, he was awarded the Arctowski Medal from the National Academy of 
Sciences. Dr. Sturrock founded and then served as president for many 
years at the Society for Scientific Exploration. He also served as 
Chairman of the Plasma Physics Division and the Solar Physics Division 
of the American Astronomical Society.
  In 2009, Dr. Sturrock published his autobiography, A Tale of Two 
Sciences: Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist, which covered both his 
research in conventional physics and his less mainstream 
investigations.
  In 2013, he published AKA Shakespeare: A Scientific Approach to the 
Authorship Question. In this book, he lays out a method for weighing 
evidence which he developed for studying pulsars. Dr. Sturrock then 
invites the reader to apply the method to tabulate their own ``degree 
of belief&#x27;&#x27; in three different candidates for authorship of the works 
usually attributed to Shakespeare.
  He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society 
in 2020 and has a deep interest in unidentified flying objects.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring Peter

[[Page E265]]

Sturrock on achieving this extraordinary milestone and in thanking him 
for his lifetime of superb scientific endeavors. He is, indeed, a 
national treasure.
