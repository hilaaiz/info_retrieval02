       CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 18, 2025

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of the City of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. On Saturday, September 
13, 2025, residents of Lake Elmo kicked off a month of celebrations 
with family, friends, and neighbors at Lions Park, including a flyover 
from the Commemorative Air Force of South St. Paul, Minnesota. Natural 
beauty, clear waters, and good fishing have long attracted people to 
the waters of what was then called Bass Lake and neighboring lakes. In 
1848, it is believed that two Virginians, Bernard and Maria Cyphers 
were the first white settlers to the area. Just south of Sunfish Lake, 
the Cyphers built a hotel and tavern called the Lake House. In 1850, 
Stillwater Road was built through the community, which served as the 
main route for stagecoaches taking passengers between Saint Paul and 
Stillwater.
  By 1872, the Saint Paul, Stillwater and Taylor&#x27;s Falls Railroad--
later the Omaha Road--was built, making it easier for tourists to reach 
the lake from Saint Paul. A post office was established at Bass Lake 
Station, with the Lake House being used as a town meeting site. In 
1879, a prominent Saint Paul businessman and railroad promotor named 
Alpheus B. Stickney was prompted by his wife Kate to pick Lake Elmo as 
the new name for the growing village and its largest lake, which was a 
name believed to be based on a popular character in literature at the 
time.
  Utilizing the city&#x27;s nearby environment and valuable natural 
resources, Lake Elmo quickly became a popular summer resort. With the 
railways in place, Lake Elmo also became a bustling commercial hub for 
agriculture and industry, supplying farmers with grain houses, 
blacksmiths, and repair shops. After Stillwater Road was fully paved 
and completed in 1920, the village underwent rapid development. In 
1925, supported by economic activity, the downtown was formalized as 
Lake Elmo Village.
  While no longer an agricultural hub, Lake Elmo continues to share its 
natural wonders with surrounding communities. Lake Elmo Regional Park 
Reserve and Sunfish Lake Park offer our community access to the 
outdoors with modern and equestrian campgrounds, fishing piers, a boat 
launch, and trails for hiking and bicycling.
  Lake Elmo has played a special role in Minnesota as a place of 
historic significance and great natural beauty. Mr. Speaker, please 
join me in celebrating the 100th anniversary of Lake Elmo.

            CELEBRATING THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF JOSEPH ELDRIDGE

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 18, 2025

  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the lifelong 
contributions of Reverend Joseph Eldridge, who celebrated his 80th 
birthday earlier this year. I have had the honor of knowing Joe for his 
selfless devotion to the causes of human rights and social justice over 
many decades, particularly with respect to Central and South America. 
Joe has been called a ``servant-leader&#x27;&#x27;, which I think is a perfect 
way of describing the way he has offered his knowledge, his integrity, 
his hard work and his faith to lift up the poor, the sick and the 
oppressed, often at great risk to his own safety and security.
  Throughout his life, Joe Eldridge has demonstrated his love of 
humanity and his respect for every person&#x27;s dignity. He listened deeply 
and given wholeheartedly. From his earliest beginnings, growing up in 
Tennessee and inspired by his father, who was a Methodist minister, Joe 
has stood up for what is right. In a social environment that was filled 
with racism and fear, he believed in a God who is fundamentally loving 
and accepting. He became

[[Page E878]]

active in the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960&#x27;s and 
1970&#x27;s, and after attending seminary decided to expand his knowledge of 
the world by working as a missionary. He soon ended up in Santiago, 
Chile, where he endured the 1973 coup that deposed President Salvador 
Allende. As he began witnessing the abuses of the Pinochet regime and 
guiding foreign journalists to document them, his friends started 
disappearing. He returned to the United States to pursue a master&#x27;s 
degree at American University&#x27;s School of International Service.
  Over the next two decades he piled up an impressive record of 
leadership by founding the Washington D.C. Office on Latin America, 
with which I have worked closely on so many issues, and directing the 
D.C. office of Lawyers Committee for Human Rights (now Human Rights 
First). He also worked on Latin American rights for the United 
Methodist Church and got himself thrown out of Honduras for 
investigating abuses by its military junta.
  In the 1990&#x27;s and 2000&#x27;s, Joe continued his passionate advocacy for 
human rights and justice through his service as a School of 
International Service professor and as American University&#x27;s longest 
serving chaplain. He is known for transforming the Kay Spiritual Life 
Center into ``a hub for social justice and courageous conversation on 
campus,&#x27;&#x27; and for bringing human rights and racial equity into the 
forefront of campus engagement. And it was not only in the university 
community that he performed his pastoral role--as a minister, he 
married legions of social activists and christened hundreds of their 
children. Whether it was weddings, funerals, or baptisms, Joe was 
always there for his community.
  In recent years, he has also served as an active and generous member 
and officer of various boards and advisory committees, including those 
of the Center for International Policy, the Area Foundation, and the 
U.S. Institute of Peace. In each of these roles, Joe has brought not 
only his kind and gentle demeanor and his thirst for truth and 
fairness, but also a wealth of experience, wisdom and good judgment. 
His influence has been legendary and welcomed.
  Joe is also a devoted husband and father who delights in spending 
time with his family. He has traveled widely with his loving wife, 
Maria Otero, and takes great pride in his three children, Justin, David 
and Ana, who lead their lives according to the values they learned from 
him.
  As Joe retires from his boards and other formal duties, I hope my 
colleagues will join me in offering him thanks for a lifetime of 
service that has made the world a better place. I wish him many years 
ahead of good health and what our late, great colleague, John Lewis, 
called ``good trouble&#x27;&#x27;.

  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Alice Merriman a very 
happy 100th birthday, who will be celebrating her milestone on 
September 26, 2025.
  In 1925, Alice was born on a farm in Battle Creek, Nebraska. Fifty 
years ago, Alice moved to Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho. Alice worked hard to 
achieve her master&#x27;s degree in Idaho.
  After working diligently to complete her degree, Alice spent the next 
twenty years working in Idaho. Together with her husband, Bob, Alice 
raised two children. Alice has exemplified the values of perseverance, 
dedication, and hard work. Alice&#x27;s dedication to her family and her 
faith exemplifies true determination and courage.
  Alice and her family have consistently embodied the traditional 
values we cherish in Idaho.
  I thank Alice Merriman for her incredible example of perseverance and 
fearlessness. I wish her a very happy birthday.

                      Thursday, September 18, 2025

  Mr. JAMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Ecumenical 
Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of the Orthodox Christian 
Church, the second largest Christian church in the world. This week, 
His All-Holiness is visiting the White House and members of Congress, 
and I am proud to join in recognizing his leadership.
  Patriarch Bartholomew has been a tireless voice for peace, religious 
freedom, and human dignity around the globe. He is also a recipient of 
the prestigious Templeton Prize, joining the ranks of Mother Teresa, 
the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, individuals who have 
dedicated their lives to advancing humanity&#x27;s purpose and moral 
compass.
  Michigan, and especially Macomb County, is blessed with a vibrant 
Greek-American community. More than 7,200 residents in Macomb trace 
their heritage to Greece, with Sterling Heights home to the largest 
concentration. Within Macomb County alone, nearly 4,500 Greek Orthodox 
faithful gather in worship and service. Parishes like St. John Greek 
Orthodox Church and Assumption Greek Orthodox Church are not just 
places of faith, they are pillars of community life, strengthening 
families, serving neighbors, and preserving treasured traditions.
  On behalf of Michigan&#x27;s 10th District, I extend my gratitude and 
pride to His All-Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew for his spiritual 
leadership and his enduring contributions to people of faith in 
Michigan, across America, and around the world.

 HONORING FOX LAKE, ILLINOIS MAYOR DONNY SCHMIT ON HIS INDUCTION INTO 
              THE GRANT COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL HALL OF FAME

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 18, 2025

  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend, and 
Fox Lake, Illinois&#x27;s 23rd Mayor, Donny Schmit, a public servant, 
community leader, and proud alumnus of Grant Community High School. I 
am proud to recognize Mayor Schmit for his decades of dedicated service 
to the people of Fox Lake and his lifelong commitment to civic and 
community engagement. And I am proud that Donny&#x27;s service is now 
forever recognized with his induction this year into the Grant 
Community High School Hall of Fame.
  The Grant Community High School Hall of Fame honors alumni who have 
achieved distinction, outstanding accomplishment, or significant 
contribution in their professions, their communities, their schools, 
their families, or their personal lives. Inductees are chosen as role 
models for students and as examples of the excellence the school seeks 
to inspire. Donny&#x27;s life and career undoubtedly reflect these very 
ideals.
  Donny graduated from Grant in 1971, where he lettered in both 
football and wrestling. Following high school, he embarked on a 
successful career in the trades, but his true calling has been in 
service to his hometown community. Over the years, he has served as a 
Village Trustee, Planning Commission Board member, and is currently in 
his fourth consecutive term as Mayor of Fox Lake. In this role, Donny 
has been a steadfast supporter of Grant High School, regularly 
attending events, welcoming student interns to the Village, 
incorporating student voices into municipal planning, and honoring 
students and coaches.
  His service extends well beyond his mayoral responsibilities. Donny 
dedicated more than 25 years as a volunteer with the Fox Lake Fire 
Department, coached young athletes with the Lakeland Cardinals, and 
helped lead programs with the Lions Club, including as an instructor 
for the blind bowling league. In addition, he has been an active member 
of his church, where he received the Christi Fidelis Award from 
Cardinal Francis George for his exceptional volunteer work.
  Through his leadership, Donny has guided significant improvements to 
the Village of Fox Lake and has been a tireless advocate for his 
community. He embodies the values of service, leadership, and integrity 
and serves as a role model for students and citizens alike.
  As part of his Hall of Fame induction, Donny will be celebrated 
during a series of homecoming events--including a reception, pep 
assembly, the varsity football game, and the homecoming parade--giving 
the community and students alike the opportunity to honor his 
achievements.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mayor 
Donny Schmit for his extraordinary service to Fox Lake, his devotion to 
Grant Community High School, and his well-deserved induction into the 
Grant Community High School Hall of Fame. His contributions will have a 
lasting impact, and his example will continue to inspire future 
generations.

  Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor His All-Holiness 
Bartholomew, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, on his visit to 
Washington, D.C., and his reception of the Templeton Prize in New York 
City.
  Patriarch Bartholomew has served since 1991 as the spiritual leader 
of more than 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, including many 
from the Greek Orthodox community from Queens, New York, whom I am 
proud to represent. Known as ``first among equals&#x27;&#x27; among the Primates 
of the Orthodox Church, he carries forward a tradition that reaches 
back nearly two thousand years to the Apostle Andrew.
  Throughout his ministry, he has been a champion of religious freedom, 
human rights, and interfaith dialogue. He has worked to build bridges 
between Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and has consistently spoken out 
for peace.
  He is also recognized as the ``Green Patriarch&#x27;&#x27; for his leadership 
in addressing climate change and environmental destruction, which he 
has called a sin against God&#x27;s creation. His efforts have brought 
together scientists, world leaders, and faith communities to safeguard 
our planet.
  The Ecumenical Patriarch is no stranger to this Capitol. In 1997, he 
received the Congressional Gold Medal under this very dome. As he 
visits Congress once again, we honor his lifetime of service as a 
peacemaker and a bridge-builder for our world.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing His All-
Holiness Bartholomew, a voice of faith, hope, and reconciliation for 
our time.

  Mr. WIED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Vernon Krawczyk, a devoted veteran, business owner, educator, and 
longtime resident of the Green Bay community.
  Born on December 23, 1933, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to Zeno and 
Isabelle Krawczyk, Vern exemplified service and commitment throughout 
his life. A proud graduate of Central Catholic High School in 1952, he 
attended St. Norbert College before enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps 
in 1954, serving honorably until 1957. He completed his degree at St. 
Norbert College in 1959 and married Judy Selissen on November 27, 1959, 
building a life rooted in family and community.
  Vern and Judy operated the Skytop Supper Club from 1972 until their 
retirement in 2005, creating a cherished gathering place for the 
community. Vern&#x27;s dedication to Green Bay was remarkable as he served 
as an adjunct instructor at NWTC for over 15 years, teaching business, 
marketing, and responsible beverage service. His leadership extended to 
roles as president of the Brown County Tavern League for over 20 years, 
former chair of the Brown County Republican Party, and member of the 
St. Vincent Hospital Advisory Council, the Bellevue Optimist Club, and 
the NEW Zoological Society&#x27;s Tech Advisory Commission. He also served 
on the City of Green Bay&#x27;s Protection and Welfare Committee and chaired 
fundraising for the Shy Ranch for Boys, further reflecting his 
commitment to education and youth. In his spare time, Vern enjoyed 
gardening, cooking, fishing, and deer camp, always with a focus on 
conservation. Through and beyond his hobbies, he touched countless 
lives with his warmth, generosity, and tireless work ethic.
  Vern is survived by his wife, Judy, their three children, Patty, 
Steve, and John; eight grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and 
many nieces and nephews.
  Mr. Speaker, Vern Krawczyk&#x27;s life was a testament to service, family, 
and community. His contributions have left an enduring impact on Green 
Bay, and his memory will continue to inspire us. I offer my deepest 
condolences to his loving wife Judy, family, friends, and the Green Bay 
community.

  Mr. DELUZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Matthew J. 
Jerbi, United States Navy, a resident of Fairfax, Virginia, who is 
retiring after 30 years of faithful service to our Nation following his 
commission from the United States Naval Academy.
  After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1995, Captain Jerbi began 
his dedicated service to our Nation. Captain Jerbi served the Navy in a

    LOWERING AGE AT WHICH A MINOR MAY BE TRIED AS ADULT FOR CERTAIN 
               CRIMINAL OFFENSES IN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. JONATHAN L. JACKSON

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                      Tuesday, September 16, 2025

  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
opposition to H.R. 5140, the D.C. Juvenile Sentencing Reform Act. This 
bill is not a serious attempt to address crime; it is a regressive, 
discriminatory, and counterproductive piece of legislation that will 
only worsen the challenges facing our communities.
  This bill would lower the age at which children can be prosecuted as 
adults in Washington, D.C., from 16 to 14 years old for certain crimes. 
This will also have the impact of reducing the minimum age for 
transferring a juvenile to adult court to be tried as an adult. House 
Republicans from three states--South Dakota, Alaska, and California--
voted to reduce the age to 14 in D.C., even though the age is 16 in 
their own states. The supporters of this bill claim it will make D.C. 
safer, but the facts and history prove otherwise.
  First, let&#x27;s talk about the discriminatory nature of this proposal. 
The juvenile justice system in Washington. D.C., already has stark 
racial disparities: more than 93 percent of youth arrests in the first 
half of 2025 were of Black youth. Lowering the age for adult 
prosecution will inevitably push more Black children into the adult 
system, a system that is not equipped to rehabilitate them.
  Furthermore, this proposal stands in direct opposition to what we 
know about juvenile justice and public safety. Research from the CDC 
and the National Research Council has consistently found that 
transferring juveniles to the adult system increases violence rather 
than reducing it. Youth charged as adults are more likely to reoffend 
than those processed in juvenile courts. This is not a deterrent; it is 
a recipe for a cycle of violence and incarceration.
  This bill would make Washington, D.C., an outlier in its approach to 
juvenile justice. While the current law already allows prosecutors to 
charge 16 and 17 year-olds as adults at their discretion, without a 
judge&#x27;s approval, H.R. 5140 would lower that age even further.
  Even in states with a history of tough-on-crime stances, many are 
moving in a more rehabilitative direction.
  This approach aligns with a broader national trend, including in 
several Republican-led states, to reform juvenile justice with a focus 
on rehabilitation rather than punishment. For example, Texas, a state 
known for its traditionally tough stance on crime, has undertaken 
significant reforms since 2007. These reforms have focused on 
encouraging local, evidence-based supervision for low-level youth 
offenders, which has led to a significant reduction in the state-level 
committed population and millions of dollars in cost savings while 
protecting public safety. Juvenile arrests in Texas dropped by 27 
percent between 2007 and 2011 following these changes.
  Similarly, in Utah, Republican Governor Gary Herbert signed a 
comprehensive set of reforms in 2017 with near-unanimous support from 
the Republican-led legislature. These reforms have also reduced 
reliance on locked detention by diverting more young people into 
community-based programs. Early outcomes from these changes show that 
the use of locked detention has fallen significantly, while the use of 
diversion is on the rise.
  Even in Georgia, another state that has historically had a lower age 
for adult prosecution, there has been a movement to extend the juvenile 
justice system. In 2022, the state passed a bill to raise the adult 
criminal age from 17 to 18 for most crimes, recognizing that this 
provides adolescents with better opportunities for rehabilitation.
  This bill would make Washington, D.C., an outlier. While the current 
law already allows prosecutors to charge 16 and 17 year-olds as adults 
at their discretion, without a judge&#x27;s approval, H.R. 5140 would lower 
that age even further. In contrast, many states are moving in the 
opposite direction, raising the age of juvenile jurisdiction, not 
lowering it.
  Real solutions to violent crime do not come from sending middle 
schoolers to adult court. They come from investing in communities. They 
come from supporting our schools, expanding after-school programs, 
providing job training, and ensuring access to mental health services.
  I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided and dangerous bill. 
Vote No on H.R. 5140.

                      Thursday, September 18, 2025

  Ms. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome His All-
Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C. He will 
be in our Nation&#x27;s Capital this week after visiting New York City, 
where he will receive the distinguished Templeton Prize. The Templeton 
Prize was previously received by Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, among others.
  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is a world-leading advocate for 
interfaith dialogue and peace. As Ecumenical Patriarch of 
Constantinople for nearly 35 years, the Patriarch has taken on the most 
difficult issues facing the world, whether it&#x27;s building bridges 
between East and West, protecting our environment, or fostering 
dialogue between religious faiths.
  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is also an international 
environmental leader and has earned the title ``Green Patriarch.&#x27;&#x27; He 
consistently used his role to bring people of different faiths together 
to discuss how they could be good stewards of the Earth, and he made 
caring for the environment a central commitment in his role as 
spiritual leader. In 1997, the Patriarch even received the 
Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor awarded by this body.
  On behalf of the vibrant Greek Orthodox community in Southern Nevada, 
I extend my deepest respects to His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming 
him to our Nation&#x27;s Capital.

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize my friend, Mr. 
David Williams, for being awarded the Best Community Banking Award for 
2025 by the Community Bankers of Michigan. This prestigious and well-
deserved distinction reflects his dedication to Michigan&#x27;s banking

small community bank in Houghton, before spending 25 years working for 
larger financial institutions in Ohio and lower Michigan. Throughout 
those years, he remained committed to a personal goal: returning to the 
Upper Peninsula to manage and grow a community bank.
  For the past 25 years, Mr. Williams has led Upper Peninsula State 
Bank with steadfast commitment to both customer service and community 
engagement. His passion for serving his community extends beyond his

      RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICAN LEGION POST 667

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. HENRY CUELLAR

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Thursday, September 18, 2025

  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th 
anniversary of American Legion Post 667 in Universal City, Texas.
  Since its chartering in 1975, Post 667 has stood as a cornerstone of 
service, supporting veterans, active-duty service members, and families 
across northeast Bexar County.
  For five decades, the Post has served as a hub for camaraderie, 
patriotic education, civic engagement, and community service.
  From mentoring youth through programs that instill duty and honor, to 
assisting veterans as they transition to civilian life, Post 667 has 
embodied the American Legion&#x27;s mission of service not self.
  Their members have organized countless community events, supported 
patriotic observances, and provided a strong voice for those who have 
worn the uniform of our Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, this milestone is an opportunity to celebrate a proud 
legacy and to honor those who have selflessly given back to our country 
and community.
  I commend American Legion Post 667 for fifty years of leadership, 
service, and sacrifice, and I wish them continued success in the 
decades ahead.

                          ____________________
