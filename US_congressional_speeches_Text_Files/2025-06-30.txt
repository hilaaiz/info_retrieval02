     CELEBRATING OUR 2025 SUMMER INTERN CLASS FOR THEIR SERVICE TO 
                       CALIFORNIA&#x27;S 20TH DISTRICT

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 30, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 
outstanding interns who have devoted their summer to serving the people 
of California&#x27;s 20th District. From my offices in Washington, D.C., and 
Bakersfield, these students have demonstrated maturity beyond their 
years, contributing their time, intellect, and drive to support our 
work in meaningful ways. They brought fresh insight, a willingness to 
learn, and an admirable commitment to public service. Their presence 
has been a welcome reminder of the promise and potential of the next 
generation. At a time when many young Americans are navigating 
questions about their role in civic life, these interns chose to engage 
directly with purpose and passion.
  As their summer internships come to a close, I want to express my 
deepest gratitude to Isaac Chipres, Luke Fernandes, and Margaret Woolf 
for their contributions to my Washington, D.C., office and to Gianna 
Gatson for her service in my Bakersfield, California office. Their hard 
work has been instrumental to my team&#x27;s efforts, and I trust that the 
skills and educational experiences they have gained will guide them 
toward continued success in their future endeavors in public service. I 
look forward to seeing where their paths lead, and I hope those paths 
include a continued dedication to serving others.

                          ____________________

                         Monday, June 30, 2025

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate Greg Batton 
and Dan Diorio as their morning radio show reaches an incredible 
milestone. For 20 years, they have been the voice of the Greg and Dan 
Show on WMBD Radio in my hometown of Peoria, Illinois. Both have 
dedicated themselves to providing residents of Central Illinois with 
relevant

[[Page E636]]

and reliable news to keep the public informed and entertained.
  They have brought a personal and powerful form of communication to 
their audience. The Greg and Dan Show serves as a bridge between 
communities, providing a unique space where local stories, issues, and 
voices can be heard.
  Greg and Dan have played a significant role in amplifying the voices 
of politicians, local leaders, and members of the community to ensure 
their listeners are informed on public events and both national and 
local issues.
  WMBD is the oldest commercial radio Station in Peoria, and for 20 
years of its rich history, Greg and Dan have been working together to 
better the lives of listeners and give back to communities and 
organizations across Central Illinois.
  This is a monumental moment for the Greg and Dan Show. I congratulate 
them on their 20 years of success. I look forward to listening to their 
show for many more years to come.

                  HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL KRAMER

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. HALEY M. STEVENS

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 30, 2025

  Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the honorable 
life of my dear friend, Michael Kramer, a passionate legal professional 
and a champion of access to education and healthcare. Mr. Kramer 
centered his life around service. Among his many contributions, his 
creation of scholarships for students at Oakland University and support 
of innovative research at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Rogel Cancer 
Center will be remembered for their ongoing impact.
  Mr. Kramer was a member of the Board of Trustees at Oakland 
University for over two decades, where he and his wife, Zina, created a 
namesake scholarship at Oakland University&#x27;s School of Medicine. In its 
inaugural year, this scholarship provided an incoming medical student 
with $50,000. This is just one example of the tremendous work Mr. 
Kramer did throughout his tenure on the board to make education more 
accessible.
  Since his passing, his friends and loved ones have consistently 
described him as ``a good man,&#x27;&#x27; and he truly was one of the best I 
have ever known. Through his work and general persona, Mr. Kramer 
always acted in the best interests of others and encouraged his peers 
to do the same. His remarkable humanitarian work contributed to his 
profile as a philanthropist through Oakland University and the 
University of Michigan. Michael Kramer passed away on March 28, 2025. 
He is survived by his remarkable wife, Zina, who has long been 
Michael&#x27;s partner in his altruistic work, his two children David 
(Aneesa) and Lisa (Josh), his grandchildren, Samuel, Max, Sydney, and 
Madison, and his sister-in-law, Anita Zicherman (Ralph).
  Mr. Speaker, I am deeply honored to recognize the life and service of 
my friend, Michael Kramer, who dedicated his time to uplifting his 
peers and strengthening community. Please join me in celebrating this 
wonderful individual and the lessons he shared with us.

                          ____________________

 INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION DISTRICT OF 
                         COLUMBIA HOME RULE ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 30, 2025

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the National Capital 
Planning Commission District of Columbia Home Rule Act. This bill would 
remove the authority of the National Capital Planning Commission 
(NCPC), a federal agency, to review or approve the development of 
District of Columbia-owned real property. This bill would also remove 
the requirement that the D.C. Mayor get NCPC&#x27;s approval before selling 
D.C.-owned real property and allow D.C. agencies to transfer 
jurisdiction over D.C.-owned real property among themselves without 
NCPC&#x27;s approval.
  Under federal law, NCPC has approval authority for the development of 
D.C.-owned buildings located in the ``central area,&#x27;&#x27; including the 
location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of such buildings. 
D.C. is required to consult with NCPC on the development of D.C.-owned 
buildings outside the central area, but NCPC has only advisory 
authority in those areas. The central area is defined by the concurrent 
action of NCPC and the D.C. Council and currently consists of the 
Downtown and Shaw Urban Renewal Areas.
  NCPC&#x27;s authority over D.C.-owned real property violates D.C. home 
rule and is unnecessary, as demonstrated by the virtual absence of its 
use to disapprove sales or development. The federal government should 
not be able to slow, block or add to the cost of the development of 
D.C.-owned real property.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

       McCOLLUM VOTE TO TABLE H. RES. 537 IMPEACHMENT RESOLUTION

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 24, 2025

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, impeachment is the most consequential tool 
Congress has for upholding our duty to defend the Constitution and 
protect the American people from a president who has betrayed his oath 
and engaged in illegal conduct.
  Bringing an impeachment resolution to the floor in the manner it was 
done by Congressman Green undermines the ability of Congress to make 
the serious and very real case for impeachment against this or any 
future president. Impeachment necessitates a deliberate process of 
investigation and thorough documentation of crimes committed against 
the American people.
  President Trump was impeached twice during his first term because he 
proved himself to be unfit to serve in office, and I voted to impeach 
him both times. Before bringing those resolutions to the floor, the 
Democratic Majority in the House committed ourselves to building the 
case, as a prosecutor does for a trial. We conducted a formal inquiry 
during the first impeachment, where we subpoenaed witnesses and held 
public hearings. We produced the evidence to demonstrate that the 
President had abused his power and obstructed Congress.
  When President Trump was impeached a second time for inciting an 
insurrection, the Democratic conference worked together to draft a 
factual and thoughtful impeachment resolution to reflect what Members 
of Congress and our entire nation witnessed on January 6, 2021. When 
the resolution was brought to the floor a week later, almost every 
House Democrat was a cosponsor. I presided over that vote in the House 
of Representatives, with full confidence in the case we were presenting 
to the American people.
  By contrast, the impeachment resolution that I will vote to table on 
June 25th was drafted in isolation by one member, and Representative 
Green introduced it a mere two hours before he came to the floor to 
push it to a vote. It was rushed to the floor with no coordination with 
the larger body of us who are working to hold President Trump 
accountable. It was not a serious attempt to gather the evidence and 
convince the American people of the grave nature of the President&#x27;s 
violations of the law and the Constitution.
  Currently, the House of Representatives is controlled by the 
President&#x27;s party, and it is clear that their majority is unwilling to 
take even the most basic step to hold President Trump accountable for 
his illegal and unconstitutional actions. To be clear, the House of 
Representatives has a duty under the Constitution to hold a president 
accountable for illegal conduct. This obligation begins with an open, 
transparent process of Congressional hearings, investigations, and 
subpoenas. The Republican majority controlling this Congress will not 
allow that work to move forward, but a premature and poorly reasoned 
resolution like this hurts our ability to progress on the path to 
accountability for President Trump.
  My constituents can count on me to hold Mr. Trump accountable in a 
manner that is fully transparent and clearly documents his malfeasance 
as the President of the United States.

               REMEMBERING ROBERT ``BOB&#x27;&#x27; LECHTRECK, SR.

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. VINCE FONG

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, June 30, 2025

  Mr. FONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life 
and legacy of Robert ``Bob&#x27;&#x27; Lechtreck, Sr., a decorated Navy veteran 
of World War II and the fifth Fire Chief of Kern County. Bob passed 
away recently, just months after celebrating his 100th birthday. His 
remarkable life reflects a century of service and deep devotion to both 
his country and his community.
  Born on April 2, 1925, Bob Lechtreck joined the U.S. Navy at the age 
of 17. He served in the Pacific Theater during World War II and saw 
combat in some of the most pivotal battles of the war, including the 
Battle of Okinawa. Just three days before his death, we marked the 80th 
anniversary of that battle, which serves as a reminder of the high cost 
of freedom and the courage of those like Bob who helped secure it. His 
ship later guarded Tokyo Bay during the signing of Japan&#x27;s formal 
surrender, helping to usher in the end of the war.
  In 1948, Bob returned home and joined the Kern County Fire 
Department. Over the course of a 30-year career, he rose through the 
ranks to become the department&#x27;s fifth fire chief. Having worked 
alongside Kern County&#x27;s very first fire chief, Harold Boway, he was a 
bridge between generations and remains the only known person to have 
driven the department&#x27;s first fire engine, a 1929 Moreland, on active 
calls.
  In his later years, Bob remained an active and honored member of the 
community. He was part of the very first Kern County Honor Flight to 
Washington, D.C., where he visited the World War II Memorial and the 
U.S. Capitol in recognition of his service. On his 100th birthday, he 
was celebrated by friends, neighbors, veterans, and members of the Kern 
County Fire Department, who gave their former chief a ceremonial ride 
in a working fire engine--a fitting tribute for a life of courage and 
leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of 
Bob Lechtreck, Sr., who was a patriot and a pillar of Kern County. His 
memory will endure in the hearts of those he inspired and the 
institutions he helped build.

                       SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS

  Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 
4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized 
schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees, 
subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference. This 
title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate 
Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place and 
purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or 
changes in the meetings as they occur.
  As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this 
information, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this 
information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the 
Congressional Record on Monday and Wednesday of each week.
  Meetings scheduled for Wednesday, July 2, 2025 may be found in the 
Daily Digest of today&#x27;s Record.
