 HONORING MAGGIE GARRETT FOR HER YEARS OF SERVICE AT AMERICANS UNITED 
                   FOR SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. ROBERT C. ``BOBBY&#x27;&#x27; SCOTT

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Saturday, April 20, 2024

  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and 
recognize the work of Maggie Garrett, who recently left Americans 
United for Separation of Church and State (Americans United or AU) 
after leading AU&#x27;s Public Policy Department and advocating for the 
separation of church and state for nearly 20 years. Maggie worked on 
church-state issues before state legislatures, Congress, and the 
Executive Branch, becoming a nationally recognized expert on religious 
liberty issues and how these issues intersect with other civil rights.
  Prior to joining Americans United, Maggie served as Legislative 
Director and Staff Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union 
(ACLU) of Georgia, and as Staff Attorney at the ACLU of Alabama. During 
her time in Alabama and Georgia, Maggie litigated high-profile cases. 
At the ACLU of Georgia, she also lobbied the state legislature, working 
with legislators across the political spectrum to fight for policies 
that protect civil rights and civil liberties and improve the lives of 
all Georgians. She played a key role in educating legislators about the 
harms of a proposed state Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), 
successfully working to ensure that the measure did not advance since 
it was drafted in a manner to deny civil rights protections in the name 
of religious liberty.
  In 2007, Maggie joined Americans United as Assistant Legislative 
Director and remained at AU for almost 17 years, achieving the position 
of Vice-President for Public Policy. In her role at AU, Maggie worked 
tirelessly to ensure that religious freedom is not misused to license 
invidious discrimination. Maggie led the work of the Coalition Against 
Religious Discrimination (CARD)--a diverse set of stakeholder groups 
she brought together from religious, religious freedom, civil rights, 
labor, reproductive rights and health, LGBTQ rights, and secular 
organizations--to oppose taxpayer-funded religious discrimination in 
social service programs. Maggie&#x27;s leadership of CARD, together with her 
expertise, helped ensure that the religious freedom of people who use 
taxpayer-funded social services is protected and that these programs 
include safeguards for the separation of church and state.
  Also, as part of her work at AU, Maggie co-chaired the National 
Coalition for Public Education (NCPE), a group of more than 50 national 
organizations working to oppose private school vouchers. Maggie has 
long been a champion of public education and fought to ensure that 
public funds remain in our public schools to be used for the education 
of all students.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my thanks and appreciation to Maggie 
for her years of service to the cause for separation of church and 
state and to protecting civil rights. Her decades of expertise were 
invaluable to me and my staff. Our Founding Fathers knew from personal 
experience the dangers of governmental entanglement with religion, 
leading them to enshrine religious freedom in the First Amendment of 
our Constitution. In fact, Thomas Jefferson warned against such excess 
in the Virginia Assembly in 1779, with the introduction of the Virginia 
Statute for Religious Freedom which would serve as the nation&#x27;s 
precursor to the First Amendment; he cautioned that, ``our civil rights 
have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our 
opinions on physics and geometry.&#x27;&#x27; Maggie&#x27;s work carried on that 
tradition. For over two decades, Maggie fought to uphold

[[Page E378]]

the separation of church and state, a foundational principle that is 
the cornerstone of true religious freedom.
  I wish her the best in her next role as Vice-President of Federal 
Affairs with the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals, where she will follow her other passion, advocating for the 
humane treatment of animals, inspired by her beloved rescue dogs 
Atticus and Finn.

                RECOGNIZING APRIL AS SECOND CHANCE MONTH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DANNY K. DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Saturday, April 20, 2024

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I wish to take a moment to 
celebrate April as Second Chance Month--a time to recognize that 
interventions that help justice-involved individuals make our 
communities safer and healthier, grow our economy, and reduce 
recidivism.
  I am deeply proud of my successes during my Congressional career that 
have given people a second chance. The impact of the criminal justice 
system is deep and harmful--breaking families, removing workers from 
their workplace, and weakening our families, communities, and economy. 
We know that providing opportunity for improvement strengthens lives, 
and it also saves taxpayer resources on re-incarceration that could 
support citizens in other ways, with the Illinois Sentencing Policy 
Advisory Council estimating that the average cost associated with one 
recidivism event is $151,662. Further, economists recognize that 
integrating individuals with records into the workforce boosts our 
economy by increasing earnings and tax revenue.
  In April of 2008, Congress passed and President George Bush enacted 
my bill--the Second Chance Act. This law has provided over $600 million 
to state, local, and tribal governments as well as reentry-focused non-
profit organizations to operate programs and services to ensure the 
success of people reentering their communities after incarceration. A 
study completed by Texas Southern University of the effectiveness of 
the Second Chance Act in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia found that 
education, vocational and work release programs, substance abuse 
programs, and family support are integral activities in reducing 
recidivism. Just this week, I joined with colleagues from both sides of 
the aisle and in both chambers to reintroduce the Second Chance 
Reauthorization Act to keep these programs running.
  Research demonstrates that postsecondary correctional education is 
greatly needed, has tremendous effectiveness, increases economic well-
being, reduces recidivism, and saves taxpayers money. Two of my bills 
to improve educational opportunity for justice-involved individuals 
became law in 2019. The REAL (Restoring Education and Learning) Act 
restored Pell grant eligibility to the incarcerated. According to the 
Vera Institute study, states can save an average of $7.6 million in 
incarceration costs each year for which people in prison have access to 
Pell Grants. The FAFSA act removed the prohibition on federal student 
aid to people with felony drug convictions. This policy unfairly 
targeted poor and minority students and cost society more in terms of 
crime and lost economic productivity. These policy changes are smart, 
cost-effective investments of taxpayer dollars.
  Unfortunately, more needs to be done to improve educational access 
for justice-involved individuals. My DEMO (Demonstrating that 
Empowerment Makes Opportunities) Act would help those with records 
obtain successful health careers. This bill is modeled on the 
successful work of Johns Hopkins and the Safer Foundation that created 
intensive training programs for workers in hospitals coupled with legal 
services, support services, technical assistance for businesses, and 
job placement services. The programs are wildly successful, giving 
people with records good jobs and giving the hospitals quality, loyal 
workers. My ED ACCESS Act would repeal the lifetime ban on the American 
Opportunity Tax Credit for those with felony drug convictions. The 
antiquated lifetime AOTC ban for people with felony drug convictions 
makes it harder for these individuals to afford college and get their 
lives on track. My REO (Reentry Employment Opportunities) Act would 
codify the successful REO program that improves job training for 
justice-impacted workers. I am pleased that the House passed a WIOA 
bill this month that included key provisions of my bill.
  We also must do more to divert people from the criminal justice 
system. Each year about 20,000 youth enter foster care due to parental 
incarceration. I worked with Rep. Barbara Lee to secure money in FY22 
to help parents whose children would be orphaned were they to enter 
prison. This trauma is avoidable, and quality diversion programs can 
strengthen families and protect millions of children from harm.
  I support and applaud my home state of Illinois for enacting the 
SAFE-T Act to eliminate cash bail. Illinois was the first state to end 
cash bail. This ban was championed by the Illinois Legislative Black 
Caucus. Justice should not target the poor. Individuals who pose a 
threat to the community will remain in jail, but those who simply can&#x27;t 
pay for bail will not. According to a November report from Researchers 
at Loyola University of Chicago&#x27;s Center for Criminal Justice, the Cook 
County jail population decreased by 12% in the month after 
implementation, with similar decreases in several other Illinois 
counties.
  As we celebrate Second Chance Act month, I recognize our successes 
and commit myself to continue to do more to help those who made 
mistakes to get the opportunities to turn their lives around.

  Mr. JAMES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my dear good friend, 
Frank Jonna, as he is honored as the Chaldean American Chamber of 
Commerce&#x27;s 2024 Businessperson of the Year.
  Frank&#x27;s entrepreneurial instincts can be traced back to working with 
his older brother, Jimmy, after he founded Jonna Construction in 1965. 
Early on, Jimmy&#x27;s leadership taught Frank the meaning of hard work, 
patience, and perseverance firsthand, propelling him to later become 
CEO of Jonna Construction.
  With over 40 years of dedication to the Metro Detroit area, Frank has 
served on the numerous Boards including Henry Ford Health, Catholic 
Central High School, Angel&#x27;s Place, and Detroit Public Television.
  Alongside these accomplishments, his legacy will forever live on in 
the community Jonna Construction has contributed to and built, 
including Michigan National Bank Building, the Henry Ford Detroit 
Pistons Performance Training Center, Mother of God Church, St. Thomas 
Church, Shenandoah Country Club, and the Chaldean Community Foundation 
Headquarters.
  Frank is the embodiment of the American Dream. In every step of his 
career, he has showcased a neverending commitment to the Southeast 
Michigan community, so on behalf of all of Michigan&#x27;s 10th 
Congressional District, congratulations to Frank Jonna.

                   REFLECTING ON MY TIME IN CONGRESS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                        Saturday, April 20, 2024

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, last year, my efforts to ensure foreign 
adversaries can&#x27;t control American social media applications was 
declared dead, and TikTok&#x27;s lobbyists were celebrating. Today, I&#x27;m 
proud to say its on the path to passing the Senate and headed to the 
President&#x27;s desk. The CCP&#x27;s last ditch attempts to destroy the bill and 
me personally failed.
  And though I didn&#x27;t expect to have to prioritize my family and leave 
Congress early, I&#x27;ll confess this is how I always wanted to go out. On 
top, with the select committee at the height of its influence, having 
just passed the most consequential bill of my career, perhaps the most 
consequential bill of this Congress, and having just completed two 
historic investigations. And with FISA and these national security 
supplemental across the finish line, this Congress has completed its 
most important homework, for which the Speaker deserves enormous 
credit.
  I firmly believe the Speaker has emerged on the other side of this 
stronger and a statesman. Any Motion to Vacate will fail, the 
Republican majority will grow as three special election seats get 
filled in the coming weeks, and what remains of this Congress will 
involve bipartisan oversight and legislation. And though I will be 
stepping away from politics, I think after this week my Republican 
colleagues will have a strong case to make come November, that they 
held the line for freedom at home and abroad.
  It&#x27;s typical at moments such as these to say ``I have no regrets.&#x27;&#x27; 
This is true legislatively and professionally. I accomplished my 
mission and got to chair the most significant committee in the 118th 
congress. Yet I have a lingering personal regret. I wish I had devoted 
more time to building personal relationships with my colleagues. Our 
time here is frenetic: filled with overlapping committee hearings and 
constant fundraising events. It&#x27;s hard to carve out time just to get to 
know your colleagues, to understand their background and motivation, 
and thereby develop trust.
  Where I was able to do that, with Senator Angus King my co-chair on 
the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, and with Raja Krishnamoorthi on the 
China committee, it produced the biggest legislative successes of my 8 
years. Put differently, my effectiveness as Congressman wasn&#x27;t 
primarily a function of intellect or op-ed writing prowess and 
certainly not fundraising, it was a direct result of forging 
friendships across our caucus and maybe more importantly across the 
aisle.
  So if there&#x27;s a lesson in that for my successor or any of my 
colleagues it&#x27;s after a grueling day of a thousand meetings, still make 
the effort to get that beer with a member you don&#x27;t know that well. 
Drink more, tweet less. Get to know your colleagues in real life before 
trashing them on social media. At the end of the day, Republicans and 
Democrats, we&#x27;re all Americans, citizens of the greatest country in the 
history of the world. Even on our worst day the world is looking to us 
for leadership. God bless America.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Saturday, April 20, 2024

  Ms. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chula Vista Assistant 
Police Chief Phil Collum, a 29-year veteran of the department who we 
sadly lost to cancer. His service and his legacy will always be 
remembered.
  Those who knew Assistant Police Chief Collum best emphasize his 
empathy, his compassion, his reputation for being fair, his work ethic, 
and more than anything, his dedication to his community.
  Community was at the heart of everything Assistant Police Chief 
Collum did. He gave the directive in 2022 to create the Community 
Engagement Division to help foster community relationships--and he 
personally led this division.
  He was committed to building bridges between officers and the 
community they serve.

[[Page E379]]

Through the Community Engagement Division, he worked to make sure that 
the Chula Vista Police Department was actively connecting with 
community members including residents, students, and business owners.
  Assistant Police Chief Collum was also deeply involved in charity 
work. He volunteered at his church. He went to Tijuana every month to 
support orphanages and help children in need as part of the Corazon de 
Vida Foundation--his empathy and compassion for others on full display.
  And, Assistant Police Chief Collum was a true trailblazer. He was the 
Chula Vista Police Department&#x27;s first Black lieutenant, first Black 
captain, and first Black assistant chief.
  He was also the first openly gay male officer in the department. In 
his own words, during an interview in 2022, Assistant Police Chief 
Collum said that he was proud to be a member of the LGBTQ community. He 
was proud to be a law enforcement officer. He was proud of his husband. 
He was proud of his community. And that he wanted to celebrate that.
  I can&#x27;t think of a better way to sum up his incredible contributions 
to our community. He broke down barriers and was a role model for so 
many.
  Assistant Police Chief Collum is survived by his loving husband, 
William Lopez, and my heart is with his family, his friends, his 
colleagues, and our entire community as we mourn this immense loss.
  We will always remember Assistant Police Chief Collum.

                   REMEMBERING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RASHIDA TLAIB

                    in the house of representatives

                        Saturday, April 20, 2024

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the 109th 
anniversary of the Armenian Genocide and stand in solidarity in the 
remembrance of the millions of lives lost during this tragic event.
  Let us not forget the hate and mistreatment Armenian families faced 
and make sure that this terrible event is never forgotten in the minds 
of Americans and our history. The Armenian Genocide was one of the 
darkest moments in human history, resulting in the deaths of 
approximately a million Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. 
Today, let us be reminded to always treat our neighbors with love and 
human dignity, and inspired by the memory of those lost, to never stop 
fighting for a better world in their honor.
  I join the Armenian communities of Michigan and across my district in 
recognizing the 109th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide as we 
remember the lives of the loved ones lost a century ago.
