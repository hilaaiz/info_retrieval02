  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Willie

Vinson, Edward, Timothy, and Debra. She is also the grandmother of 12, 
the great-grandmother of 30, and has 4 great-great grandchildren.
  Mrs. Huff is known for many things and one of them is her pineapple-

hosting the best Christmas parties and cookouts for her entire family. 
She is also known for her sharp sense of style, with the hats, furs, 
and suits to match her signature Obama purses and Cadillac.
  Above all else, Willie Ann Huff is a brave fighter, surviving 
multiple bouts with cancer. I hereby take official note of the joyous 
occasion of Mrs. Willie Ann Huff&#x27;s 90th Birthday and invite all 
citizens to join me in wishing her the happiest of birthdays.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 10, 2023

  Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a very special veteran from 
Oklahoma&#x27;s First Congressional District, U.S. Army Air Forces Corporal, 
Ralph M. Simoni.
  Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on July 6, 1923, Cpl. Simoni is 
celebrating his 100th birthday today. In 1943, Cpl. Simoni began 
serving our Nation during World War II at one of the most consequential 
moments in human history. He bravely served in the Asiatic-Pacific 
Theater of the war from 1943 to 1946 and received a Victory Medal for 
doing his part to secure Victory Over Japan Day, better known as ``V-J 
Day&#x27;&#x27;, that marked the end of the war on September 2, 1945.
  Cpl. Simoni served as an airplane propeller mechanic in the 
pioneering 4th Glider Section of the U.S. Army Air Forces. Cpl. 
Simoni&#x27;s work helped U.S. glider aircraft drop paratroopers and light 
artillery into enemy territory. Glider missions were dangerous and 
designed for a single purpose that resulted in very few of the aircraft 
ever being recovered. Cpl. Simoni and the 4th Glider Section conducted 
several successful missions in New Guinea, Luzon, and the South 
Philippines liberation campaigns of World War II.
  Cpl. Simoni now lives in my hometown of Tulsa and is deservedly being 
recognized today as the precious American hero that he is by his 
friends and family. Following the recent celebration of Independence 
Day, it is my honor to thank Cpl. Simoni on behalf of a grateful Nation 
for his remarkable military service and wish him a very happy birthday.

                     HONORING THE LIFE OF JIM HOUCK

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. JIM COSTA

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 10, 2023

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Jim Houck, 
a beloved journalist and Central Valley resident.
  Jim Houck was a remarkable journalist whose spirit and dedication to 
the truth have left a deep mark on the field of journalism. Jim was not 
only a journalist; he was a storyteller, a mentor, and a friend to 
many. His career spanned an impressive 60 years, during which he 
fearlessly pursued the truth, never shying away from holding the 
powerful accountable.
  Jim&#x27;s journey in journalism began while he was still in high school 
in Bakersfield. From those early days. he developed a passion that 
never wavered throughout his career. He worked for esteemed 
publications such as the San Francisco Examiner, the Dallas Morning 
News, and the Baltimore Sun, where he honed his skills as a reporter 
and editor. Jim&#x27;s tales of his time in San Francisco during the 1960s 
and &#x27;70s were legendary, capturing both the vividness and hilarity of 
his experiences.
  In 1998, Jim joined the Visalia Times-Delta/Tulare Advance-Register, 
where he served as the city editor. He was a champion of public service 
journalism, earning 4 Gruner Awards for his outstanding coverage of 
critical issues--ranging from violations of open meeting laws to 
corruption scandals. Jim firmly believed in the public&#x27;s right to 
knowledge and dedicated himself to ensuring that his readers were well-
informed and empowered.
  Jim&#x27;s contributions extended beyond his professional accomplishments. 
He was a mentor and a friend to many and was admired and respected by 
those who had the privilege of working alongside him. His determination 
to uncovering the truth inspired his colleagues and instilled in them 
the same dedication to their craft. Jim&#x27;s storytelling skills were 
legendary, and it was not uncommon for fellow journalists to gather 
around his desk, captivated by his tales of covering high-profile cases 
or his adventures in journalism.
  Beyond his devotion to journalism, Jim was also a passionate fan of 
baseball, particularly the San Francisco Giants. He found joy in 
sharing the victories and defeats of his beloved team with his fellow 
fans in the newsroom, engaging in good-natured banter with those who 
supported the Los Angeles Dodgers.
  Jim&#x27;s commitment to seeking the truth and holding those in power 
accountable serves as a beacon of inspiration for all journalists. His 
legacy will continue to live on in the hearts and minds of all who knew 
him. As we honor his memory, let us remember the lessons he taught us, 
the stories he shared, and the unwavering commitment he had to the 
pursuit of truth.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jim Houck for 
his commitment to journalism and his community. May we never forget his 
legacy and continue to be inspired by his story.

                  HONORING THE LIFE OF SANDRA BLAUVELT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JARED HUFFMAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 10, 2023

  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Sandra Blauvelt, 
who passed away at the age of 81 on April 18, 2023. Sandra was a 
beloved member of the community and devoted public servant.
  Born in 1941 in Cleveland, Ohio, Sandra, fondly known as Sandy, grew 
up the youngest of 7 children. An ambitious and intelligent young 
woman, she attended Hathaway Brown School in Shaker Heights, where she 
served as the president of her high school class, won junior skating 
championships, and was admitted to Wellesley College. Sandy married her 
high school sweetheart, Gerrit Blauvelt, and they traveled across the 
country with their growing family while he finished medical school. 
After 2 years in the Navy, the family moved from Virginia to Larkspur, 
California where Sandy quickly began her decades of service to the 
Larkspur community.
  At the old Larkspur-Corte Madera school, Sandy organized parents and 
community members to volunteer at a new after-school enrichment 
program, sharing their personal passions and skills with students. Her 
community organizing skills assisted Joan Lundstrom in becoming the 
first woman elected to the Larkspur City Council in 1971. She also 
helps to raise funds for the acquisition of a section of Northridge as 
open space in 1977 and ran the successful campaign of Hal Brown for 
Marin County Supervisor in 1984. After his election, Sandy served as 
his aide for many years.
  Sandy dedicated decades of service to Marin County, including as the 
founding President of the Larkspur Community Foundation, 42 years on 
the Larkspur Park and Recreation Commission, and as a longtime member 
of the Marin Conservation League. Her contributions earned recognitions 
and she was deservedly awarded Citizen of the Year in 2005 by the City 
of Larkspur.
  Along with her political savvy, Sandy was known for her dedication to 
friends, family, and neighbors and for her active role as a 
grandmother. While she will be greatly missed, her legacy will live on 
through the positive impact she had on her community.
  Sandy was predeceased by her husband Gerrit and is survived by her 
daughter Molly Blauvelt, son Andy Blauvelt, grandsons Jonny and Sam 
Rank, granddaughters Sophie and Alice Blauvelt, and dozens of nieces, 
nephews, grandnieces, and grandnephews.
  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you join me in extending 
condolences to Sandy&#x27;s family and friends and in expressing deep 
appreciation for her decades of public service in her community.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 10, 2023

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Restroom Access Act 
of 2023, which would require retail establishments to provide 
individuals with medical conditions requiring immediate use of a 
restroom, such as Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis, access to 
employee-only restrooms when such establishments do not have public 
restrooms. Individuals would have to present a Department of Labor-
issued identification card certifying such a medical condition.
  Individuals with certain medical conditions need immediate access to 
a restroom. When public restrooms are not available, these individuals 
may experience uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. As long as 
there are no safety concerns, which this bill addresses, these 
individuals should be able to use employee-only restrooms.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 10, 2023

  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the service of 
one of the New Democrat Coalition&#x27;s most exceptional staffers, Kevin 
Klinkenberg. Kevin recently left the Coalition to begin his tenure as a 
Senior Advisor and Congressional Liaison at the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS). I can truly say that HHS and all 
Americans are lucky to have him in this role.
  In his 2 years with the Coalition, including my tenure as Chair of 
the New Democrat Coalition, Kevin proved himself to be an invaluable 
asset who shaped our policy work and outreach efforts. From health care 
and trade to immigration, Kevin&#x27;s work was exemplary. We would not have 
been able to accomplish all that we have without Kevin&#x27;s presence on 
our team.
  Kevin also led the New Dems&#x27; outreach work, forming critical 
relationships with important stakeholder groups, from labor to the 
business community. His commitment to expanding the reach of the New 
Dems has positively impacted each of our nearly 100 members, including 
me, and his work will continue to benefit the Coalition long after his 
departure.
  Kevin has not only contributed to the Coalition through his superb 
work but also through

[[Page E643]]

his kind and collaborative spirit which is known to all those who had 
the privilege of working with him. Although we are sad to see him go, 
we know that Kevin will excel in his new role, and I wish him the very 
best in all his future endeavors.

                           STATE CHAMPIONSHIP

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 10, 2023

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the incredible 
achievements of the 2022-2023 Mid Valley High School softball team. 
During this year&#x27;s season, the Spartanettes brought great pride to our 
community by winning the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic 
Association (PIAA) 3A State Championship for the first time in school 
history.
  As the Member of the U.S. House representing the Mid Valley School 
District, I&#x27;m proud to celebrate the hard work, leadership, and 
comradery of the Spartanettes that led to their championship. They 
played with passion and a sense of faith in one another which was 
evident in every game. They demonstrated that when a group of 
individuals support each other with a common goal, anything is 
possible.
  I want to acknowledge the coaching staff, led by Coach Mike Piercy, 
and Assistant Coach Joseph Bour, who have instilled a culture of 
commitment, integrity, and respect in these athletes. Under their 
guidance, Mid Valley truly played a season worthy of the first-ever 
softball state title in Mid Valley history.
  The success of the 2022-2023 team is also a reflection of the support 
they received from their school and locality. From parents and families 
who cheered them on in every game, including traveling to Penn State 
from Mid Valley for the championship. By teachers and staff who have 
provided guidance and encouragement, and by the businesses and 
organizations that also supported the team, the Mid Valley Spartanettes 
have been lifted up and given confidence by the entire community.
  In Northeastern Pennsylvania we believe in the power of working 
together and showing civic spirit. The Mid Valley Spartanettes 
championship is a testament to the strength of that belief. These 
athletes demonstrated what can happen when we support our young people 
to the fullest.
  So, I congratulate the 2022-2023 Mid Valley High School softball team 
on their historic season and thank them for inspiring us all. I&#x27;m proud 
to represent Mid Valley and look forward to celebrating many more 
successes in the future.

  Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the 
Native American Basketball Invitational on 20 years of commitment to 
youth empowerment and fostering athletic talent within Native American 
communities. Since 2003, NABI has been the largest and most prestigious 
all Native American Basketball tournament in the nation, cultivating 
the spirit of competition and camaraderie among our youth.


 =========================== NOTE =========================== 

  
  On July 10, 2023, page E642, in the second column, the following 
appeared: nities. Since 2003, NABI has been the largest and most 
prestigious all Native American Basketball tournaments in the

  The online version has been corrected to read: nities. Since 
2003, NABI has been the largest and most prestigious all Native 
American Basketball tournament in the nation, cultivating the 
spirit of competition and camaraderie among our youth.


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

  NABI brings together thousands of students each year to compete, but 
its legacy goes far beyond the basketball court. NABI inspires our 
youth through education and empowerment programs that instill the 
values of being a good teammate, friend, and citizen. This minority and 
women-led organization has created opportunities for Native American 
athletes to shine at the collegiate and professional levels. NABI&#x27;s 
advocacy on and off the courts has resulted in nearly half a million 
dollars in scholarships for youth through its College Scholarship 
Fund--breaking down barriers to allow students to pursue their highest 
ambitions.
  I thank the NABI founders GinaMarie Scarpa and Mark West, its 
community partners and those involved in this commendable endeavor. Our 
community is stronger because of them. I am confident that their 
passion and service will continue to empower and inspire generations to 
come.

                       SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS

  Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 
4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized 
schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees, 
subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference. This
