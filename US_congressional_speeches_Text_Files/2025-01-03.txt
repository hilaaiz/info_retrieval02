                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
Northville Central School girls&#x27; soccer team, the Falcons, on a hard-
fought championship game victory following an impressive season.
  The Falcons, led by head coach Doug Hammons, won the state 
championship 1-0, on a goal from freshman Lexi Ginter on a rebound from 
Korrine Bly&#x27;s free kick in the twenty-fifth minute of the game. The 
Falcons&#x27; defense maintained steady pressure and emerged victorious over 
the Copenhagen Golden Knights.
  The Falcons&#x27; 2024 season finished with a 15-7 record and the New York 
State Class D State Soccer Championship. They are the first Western 
Athletic Conference team to win a state championship in girls&#x27; soccer--
a remarkable accomplishment.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, I would like to 
congratulate the Northville Falcons on their tremendous 2024 soccer 
season culminating with the New York State Class D Soccer title.

                          ____________________

         CELEBRATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF PATRICK ``RICK&#x27;&#x27; ENGLE

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Patrick 
``Rick&#x27;&#x27; Engle on being elected St. Lawrence County Sheriff.
  Rick has been an outstanding leader in the St. Lawrence County 
community and has worked for the Sheriff&#x27;s office for 23 years. Rick 
enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during his senior year of 
high school as part of the Marine Corps&#x27; delayed entry program and 
graduated basic training in 1991. During his time in the military, he 
served as a fire team leader, squad leader, patrol team leader, and as 
a motor vehicle operator instructor. He also deployed overseas, serving 
on peacekeeping missions in Haiti and Cuba during his time as a Marine.
  Following his time in the Marine Corps, Rick decided he wanted to 
pursue a career in law enforcement to continue serving his community. 
He began working road patrol for the St. Lawrence County Sheriff&#x27;s 
Office as a deputy in 2001. Rick then worked his way up to investigator 
before running for Sheriff himself.
  During his campaign for Sheriff, Rick pledged to listen to his 
community and focus on providing service over politics--a promise he 
upholds as County Sheriff each day. He has worked to strengthen 
relationships between St. Lawrence County&#x27;s law enforcement agencies 
and other first responders, rescuers, and emergency service providers. 
Rick&#x27;s selfless leadership and dedication to his community, exemplify 
why his colleagues specially requested he run for the Sheriff&#x27;s seat 
and why officers with eight local police unions supported his bid.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st district, I am honored to recognize the 
distinguished, decades long service and commitment to his community of 
Sheriff Patrick ``Rick&#x27;&#x27; Engle. I congratulate him on his incredible 
achievements and look forward to witnessing his future endeavors in the 
community.

         HONORING GARRY DOUGLAS FOR HIS SERVICE AND DEDICATION

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Garry Douglas for 
his hard work and advocacy on behalf of the North Country and its 
business community.
  In December 1992, Mr. Douglas was selected to lead the North Country 
Chamber of Commerce from a pool of over 100 candidates. Prior to this, 
he served as Executive Assistant to Congressman Gerald Solomon for 
fourteen years. During his time in the Chamber, Mr. Douglas has worked 
tirelessly to provide members with multiple services and expand that 
membership. Today, the North County Chamber of Commerce boasts a 
membership of over 4,200 businesses across Clinton, Essex, Franklin, 
Hamilton, and Warren Counties.
  During his tenure, Mr. Douglas has weathered many economic storms. 
When a local air base was forced to close under the 1993 Base 
Realignment and Closure Commission, Mr. Douglas seized the opportunity 
to expand into the Canadian market. Mr. Douglas and the Chamber Board 
were swift to fill the vacuum left by the closure with new business for 
the community. Similarly, when faced with the Covid-19 pandemic, he 
created an economic plan to assist all the businesses in the North 
Country, not just Chamber members, on how to navigate New York State&#x27;s 
regulations. He also instructed Chamber of Commerce staff to assist 
small businesses in securing federal and state resources.
  Mr. Douglas also founded the North American Center of Excellence for 
Transportation Equipment (NAmTrans) which develops and serves a cluster 
of transport equipment and aerospace manufacturers in northern New 
York. Mr. Douglas&#x27; efforts to improve the business environment led to 
the recognition of a Quebec-New York corridor, uniting regions that 
have close historical and cultural relationships in economic 
development efforts.
  Mr. Douglas has received many accolades during his time leading the 
Chamber from local, regional, and state organizations. City &amp; State 
Magazine has recognized Mr. Douglas on both its Economic Development 
Power 75 list and its Upstate New York Power 100 list. While Mr. 
Douglas would be the first to credit his team at the Chamber with much 
of his success, there is no doubt that his visionary leadership has 
significantly enhanced the North Country&#x27;s economic development. 
Earlier this year, the Town of Plattsburgh officially named a road in 
the newly opened Clinton County Business Industrial Gateway as Douglas 
Boulevard in honor of his service to the region.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, I am proud to celebrate the 
achievements of my friend Garry Douglas. His dedication to public 
service and tireless support of small businesses across the North 
Country has benefited many and will continue to help the North Country 
for decades to come.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James ``Jim&#x27;&#x27; 
Wallace who has diligently served his community as County Administrator 
for Herkimer County for 45 years.
  Jim is highly regarded by his peers and throughout his community, as 
he was unanimously appointed by the Herkimer County Legislature. First 
appointed in 1979, Jim has been an incredible champion for Herkimer 
County working to increase investment and promote economic development 
during his time as County Administrator.
  Through his role as County Administrator, Jim worked closely with the 
Herkimer County Industrial Development Agency (IDA). They came together 
to expand businesses, enhance economic development, and create jobs 
throughout the county. These results have been seen in the investment 
of millions of dollars in energy, manufacturing, healthcare, and 
tourism industries across the county.
  If you asked Jim, he would be among the first to credit his success 
to his hard-working staff and colleagues but there is no doubt that 
Jim&#x27;s stalwart leadership has been invaluable to Herkimer County. 
Former Herkimer County Legislature Chairman Vincent Bono has 
characterized Jim as a well-respected man with a wealth of knowledge, 
calling him a tremendous asset to Herkimer County. I am proud to 
represent individuals like Jim in my district who diligently work for 
the betterment of the North Country.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st district, it is my privilege and honor 
to recognize the incredible accomplishments of James ``Jim&#x27;&#x27; Wallace. I 
congratulate him on his incredible achievements and look forward to 
witnessing his future endeavors in the community.

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patrick J. Kelly, a 
St. Lawrence County native who was named New York State&#x27;s economic 
developer of the year by the New York State Economic Development 
Council (NYSEDC).
  In January 2012, Patrick was appointed the St. Lawrence County 
Industrial Development Agency&#x27;s Chief Executive Officer and has since 
served faithfully in this capacity overseeing the agency&#x27;s planning, 
initiation, implementation, and administration of programs. In this 
role, Patrick encourages and attracts industries to locate or expand 
within St. Lawrence County, boosting our local economy. In 2023 alone, 
Patrick helped lead 45 IDA projects in St. Lawrence County which helped 
retain 615 jobs and create an additional 225 roles in our community.
  Patrick was elected as the NYSEDC Board Chair in 2020 following his 
success in St. Lawrence. As Board Chair, Patrick showed himself to be a 
true leader as someone who understands how to create economic 
opportunity and knows how to build consensus to move initiatives 
forward.
  Upon receiving his award, Patrick congratulated his team and the many 
people that helped him and the program succeed showing true 
selflessness and thoughtfulness. While Patrick serves as CEO and as 
NYSEDC Board Chair in his professional life, he is also a loving 
husband to his wife, Jackie, and a caring father to his children 
balancing his busy career with his loving family.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st district, it is my privilege and honor 
to recognize the incredible accomplishments of Patrick J. Kelly. I 
congratulate him on his incredible achievements and look forward to 
witnessing his future endeavors in the community.

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lawrence ``Larry&#x27;&#x27; 
Dolhof and congratulate him on being re-elected Chairman of the Lewis 
County Board of Legislators. Larry has served two separate tenures on 
the County Legislature with a total of 15 years of service including as 
the Board&#x27;s Representative for District 8, which includes the towns of 
Pinckney, Harrisburg, Montague, West Turin, and Osceola.
  Larry was first elected to the Board of Legislators in 2000 and 
briefly served two terms returning to private life in 2004 before being 
reelected in 2013. He earned the unanimous support of his colleagues to 
serve as Chairman in 2018 and was recently reelected to another term as 
Chairman in 2023. Under his leadership, the legislature has prioritized 
fiscal responsibility and infrastructure improvements throughout the 
county. Larry has led efforts to renovate the Human Services building, 
build a new highway garage, and provide a new facility for the DMV and 
Board of Elections.
  Larry&#x27;s leadership has helped to usher in a lower tax rate, 
decreasing the tax rate from the previous decade and leveraging more 
than $3.5 million in broadband infrastructure, reducing the number of 
unserved households by over 70 percent. The people of Lewis County have 
increased access to online resources necessary for education, 
healthcare, and emergency communication thanks to Larry&#x27;s stewardship. 
A dedicated community leader, Larry has forged partnerships with state 
and federal representatives to address issues regarding tourism, 
renewable energy opportunities, and health and human services programs, 
while advocating for the full and fair representation of the voices in 
his rural county.
  His service as Chairman of the Board is not the only way Larry serves 
his community. He and his wife Donna reside in Lyons Falls where they 
own and operate Dolhof Hardware. They offer hardware, lumber, building 
materials, steel roofing, sporting goods, rifles, shotguns, and 
automotive goods, as well as a drive-up propane filling station to 
provide essential access to energy in cold upstate winters.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st district, I am honored to recognize 
Lawrence ``Larry&#x27;&#x27; Dolhof and congratulate him on his years of 
dedicated public service to the people of Lewis County and on his 
reelection as Chairman of the Board of Legislators.

outstanding leader in the Greenwich community ever since he retired. He 
served as mayor from 1986 to 1995 and spearheaded the creation of the 
Greenwich Gazebo, Chamber of Commerce, the Youth Center, and the 
curbside recycling program. The people of Greenwich feel the lasting 
impact of Louis&#x27; leadership each day.
  Louis is also active in the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a veteran 
service organization, and is instrumental in the Voice of Democracy 
Scholarship Program for high school and middle school students which 
instills patriotism and democracy in Greenwich&#x27;s youth. He is a loving 
husband to his wife, Susan whom he celebrated 67 years of marriage with 
this summer.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st District, I am honored to recognize the 
incredible service of Army Veteran Louis Leone. I congratulate him on

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Timothy ``Tim&#x27;&#x27; 
Mihuc, Ph.D., for his years of service to the North Country community 
and his efforts to protect native aquatic life in the Lake Champlain 
Basin.
  Dr. Mihuc began his career as an undergrad majoring in Biology at 
Oral Roberts University and his interest in science and the environment 
led him to pursue a Master&#x27;s in Zoology from Oklahoma State University. 
Dr. Mihuc went on to complete his Ph.D. at Idaho State University. 
After graduation, he spent several years at Louisiana State University 
as a post-doctoral researcher conducting invasive species research in 
the Atchafalaya River Basin. He then served as director of the Great 
Rivers Field Station for the Illinois Natural History Survey where he 
led a research team working on the Upper Mississippi River.
  The State University of New York at Plattsburgh hired Dr. Mihuc in 
1999 as an Associate Professor of Environmental Science and he was 
named the first Director of the Lake Champlain Research Institute 
(LCRI) that same year. The institute&#x27;s primary objective was to assist 
and promote student research across multiple disciplines related to 
Lake Champlain and its ecosystem.
  Dr. Mihuc also serves as Co-Director of the Lake Champlain Sea Grant 
Institute, a branch of the National Sea Grant College Program, which 
aims to raise awareness to improve the environmental health of the Lake 
Champlain region and encourage sustainable economic development. The 
institute supports research on best land and water management practices 
and provides that research to organizations, businesses, and 
individuals throughout the Lake Champlain Basin.
  In 2018, Dr. Mihuc was promoted to the SUNY Distinguished 
Professorship rank by the SUNY Board of Trustees in recognition of his 
dedication to the campus, the community, and Lake Champlain. During his 
tenure at SUNY Plattsburgh, he successfully implemented advanced 
experiential learning opportunities for students through LCRI and other 
avenues.
  Further demonstrating his expertise, I was honored to invite Dr. 
Mihuc to bring his expertise to Congress. On June 16, 2022, he 
testified in front of the Committee on Natural Resources&#x27; Subcommittee 
on Water, Oceans, and Wildlife in support of H.R. 6936, the Stamp Out 
Invasive Species Act. In his testimony, Dr. Mihuc cited his work at 
LCRI and how critical federal funding is to educate the public and 
combat invasive species in the wild.
  On behalf of New York&#x27;s 21st district, I would like to thank Dr. 
Mihuc for his contributions to the North Country and Lake Champlain.

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding constituent from my district, Lenny Ward, Sr. As a veteran 
and dedicated community service member, Lenny has devoted his career to 
his country and community. Through military service and volunteer work, 
Lenny has spent most of his life cultivating a lifetime of purpose and 
spirit. His relentless care and advocacy for others does not go 
unnoticed, and therefore I wish to commend him today.
  Since Lenny was a child, he was driven to serve his country in the 
military. Lenny put his aspirations and life on hold and joined the 
United States Air Force from 1962 through 1966 as a Medic. During his 
time in the United States Air Force, Lenny was deployed to Vietnam from 
1965 through 1966.
  Lenny spent much of his career at Pine Valley Golf Club as a Caddy 
Master from 1994 through 2013. His infectious positive attitude will 
always be what he was most proud of during his career. His charisma and 
smile made people gravitate towards him.
  I am beyond proud of and exceptionally grateful for Lenny Ward, Sr.&#x27;s 
service to our great Nation and grateful for the legacy he has left in 
our community. His dedication to this country as a United States Air

  Ms. PETTERSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lynnae Flora

the people of Jefferson County.

dedicated her professional life to ensuring every member of the 
Jefferson County community can access health services and receive the

county for almost three decades and through numerous challenges, 
including the COVID-19 pandemic. Her leadership and passion kept the 
department running and kept vital services open for the people of 
Jefferson County.
  Her impact is not limited to her role as Deputy Director. As a member 
of the Health Ethics committee and the steering committee for the 
Healthier Jeffco Alliance, Lynnae has collaborated with organizations 
across Jefferson County to promote a smarter, fairer, and more 
equitable health care system. Her work, and the dedication she has 
shown to her community, are a proud example for every Coloradan. The 
people of Jefferson County owe Lynnae a debt of gratitude.
  On behalf of the people of Colorado&#x27;s Seventh Congressional District, 
it is my honor to congratulate Lynnae on her well-earned retirement and 
to thank her for her commitment to our community.

             REMEMBERING THE INCREDIBLE LIFE OF JOHN ZURLO

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, January 3, 2025

  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the 
incredible life of my friend, John Zurlo. John was a pillar of our 
North Country community, and his life has left a lasting legacy on the 
lives of thousands.
  John was born on October 24, 1938, in Plattsburgh, New York, and 
raised in the nearby town of Champlain on the New York-Canada border. 
He attended St. Michael&#x27;s College in Vermont and graduated with a B.A. 
in Business Administration in 1960. John then returned to his hometown 
to teach business at Northeastern Clinton Central School, a position he 
held for 34 years. He also served as the coach for the school&#x27;s 
baseball and golf teams.
  Going beyond his employment at Northeastern Clinton Central School, 
John continually gave back to the youth serving as the president of 
Champlain Central Teacher&#x27;s Association and the local Youth Hockey 
Association, North Country Cougars Youth Hockey Association. John was 
also a member of the St. Michael&#x27;s College Alumnus Board of Directors.
  Further, John was extremely active in his community and held many 
roles in organizations across the region including the Rouses Point 
Kiwanis Club, Teacher&#x27;s Federal Credit Union, Board of Directors for 
Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital, St. Mary&#x27;s Mission Center, 
Knights of Columbus Council No. 3525, Plattsburgh Lodge of Elks No. 
621, Plattsburgh Rotary International, and the Lake Champlain Citizens 
Advisory Committee.
  John was also a public servant and was elected to several positions, 
including Champlain tax collector and Clinton County Legislator, before 
being elected Clinton County Clerk in 1995. John was reelected to his 
eighth term as the Clinton County Clerk in November 2023 and was the 
longest-serving Clinton County Clerk.
  Outside the public sphere, John was also known for his generosity and 
kindness and became a mentor to many in Clinton County. I had the good 
fortune to be seated next to John at a judicial candidate event twelve 
years ago. When I informed him that I planned to run for the New York 
21st Congressional Seat at the age of 28 and he nearly fell out of his 
chair. Or at least he always told it that way, but since that day I 
could always rely on John for advice and friendship. In my many visits 
to Clinton County, it was always a highlight to see John, whether it 
was at county events or seeing him at the Rouses Point Independence Day 
Parade in his antique car without fail every year.
  John was warm and welcoming to all and a true North Country icon. He 
loved his family, friends, community, and country. His legacy will live 
on in the hearts of all who had the pleasure of knowing him. On behalf 
of New York&#x27;s 21st Congressional District, it is my honor to remember 
and celebrate the incredible life of John Zurlo.
