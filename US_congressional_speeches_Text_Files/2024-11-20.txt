  COMMENDING DAVID ZIMMERMAN ON 27 YEARS OF SERVICE TO TAZEWELL COUNTY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. DARIN LaHOOD

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 20, 2024

  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize David Zimmerman 
for his decades of service to the Central Illinois community. Zimmerman 
served on the Tazewell County Board for 27 years and was the chairman 
of the board for the last 16 years.
  Zimmerman graduated from Illinois State University with a degree in 
Political Science and began his service to the Tazewell County Board in 
1997. Before becoming chairman, Zimmerman held many responsibilities as 
a board member including Finance, HR, Insurance Review, and Land Use 
Chair. During his tenure on the Board, Zimmerman positively influenced 
the lives of his constituents by improving the well-being of Tazewell 
County.
  Outside of his work on the Tazewell County Board, Zimmerman has 
served the people of Central Illinois through different public service 
roles. Examples include the Greater Peoria Economic Development 
Commission Executive Board, United Counties Council of Illinois Vice-
President, Tazewell County and Peoria Salvation Army Board Member, and 
Berean Prison Ministry Board Member, among others. A strong leader 
within the Central Illinois community, Zimmerman was also recognized in 
the Peoria Magazine through their ``40 Leaders Under 40&#x27;&#x27; award.
  David Zimmerman&#x27;s decades long efforts have left a lasting impact on 
the Greater Peoria community and the state of Illinois. His commitment 
to our community is truly inspiring and I wish him the best in all 
future endeavors.

  Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mannsdale Upper 
Elementary School for its National Blue Ribbon School distinction. 
Since 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has recognized 
schools for academic achievements and efforts to close the educational

demonstrate the importance of ensuring all students can achieve high 
academic standards. This award is among the highest national honors 
given to schools across the United States. This year, only 256 schools 
received recognition, and Mannsdale Upper Elementary is among the top 
schools, not only in Mississippi but also nationwide. I am proud to see 
Mannsdale Upper Elementary honored with this prestigious award.
  I want to thank Dr. Nicole Cockrell, Principal of Mannsdale Upper 
Elementary, Assistant Principal Mrs. Holly Jones, and Madison County 
School District Superintendent Ted Poore for their dedicated work in 
fostering such a high-achieving learning environment.
  I extend my gratitude to the teachers and leaders in Madison County 
and across Mississippi for their unwavering and selfless dedication to 
helping students learn, grow, and strive for continuous improvement.

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John 
Browne, an extraordinary individual from Mountainside, New Jersey, as 
he celebrates his 50th anniversary as a volunteer firefighter with the 
Mountainside Fire Department. Since joining the department in February 
1974, John has responded to no less than 60 percent of fire calls each 
year during his 50-year tenure--more than any other volunteer 
firefighter in the history of the department. He has been described as 
the type of first responder you can always count on to be there, 
serving in every capacity, including line officer, lieutenant, captain, 
deputy chief, assistant chief, and even as fire chief on three separate 
occasions. In his free time, John continues to educate and serve his 
community by volunteering to help lead free public tours of the John J. 
Harvey Fireboat Museum and Education Center in New York Harbor. John&#x27;s 
dedication and commitment to the community of Mountainside have been 
immeasurable, and I thank him for his incredible contributions to New 
Jersey&#x27;s 7th Congressional District.

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 20, 2024

  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Kathi Hemken as 
she concludes 16 years of service leading the City of New Hope. 
Throughout her time as Mayor, residents have come to know her as a 
devoted advocate for their well-being, a thoughtful steward of the 
public good, and a relentless driver of housing and economic 
development.
  Mayor Hemken began her career with the city on the New Hope Planning 
Commission in 1997. After two years as Chair, she won her first term as 
Mayor in 2008. She wasted no time in getting to work on behalf of her 
constituents and fostering a culture of appreciation, respect, and 
excellence among the staff at City Hall.
  Over the past 14 years, New Hope has undergone a remarkable 
resurgence of new housing and business. The city&#x27;s property tax base 
has grown by over a billion dollars, a surge of 73 percent--an 
impressive amount of growth that would not have been possible without 
Mayor Hemken&#x27;s leadership. They&#x27;ve added nearly 500 new apartment 
units, 127 single family homes, and through the Scattered Site Housing 
Program, 30 new or rehabilitated single-family homes. These 
developments include workforce housing, assisted living, deeply 
affordable housing, and luxury housing--a diversity that serves all 
residents of New Hope. The City Center underwent a transformative 
multi-phase redevelopment, introducing an aquatic park, a performance 
center, a new City Hall, an upgraded police station, and essential 
businesses like a Hy-Vee grocery store, resulting in over $15 million 
in local improvements and the creation of 400 jobs.
  Always accessible, Mayor Hemken builds strong relationships with 
constituents and city staff, promotes open dialogue on complex issues, 
and fosters an environment of growth and appreciation within the 
community. A strong supporter of small businesses, she was even 
featured on ``The Colbert Show.&#x27;&#x27; When a small business highlighted on 
the show required assistance, she connected with the owner and provided 
essential resources to help them navigate the challenges that arose 
from their sudden fame and increased demand.
  Beyond economic development, Mayor Hemken demonstrates her passion 
for promoting literacy by collecting and distributing books for local 
children and engaging with students through reading programs. She has 
served on countless boards and committees, including the Regional 
Council of Mayors, the Northwest YMCA, League of Women Voters, and 
more. Each winter, she personally bakes hundreds of cookies and 
packages them up with a personal note of appreciation to each and every 
city employee.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our profound 
gratitude to New Hope Mayor Kathi Hemken for her hard work and 
dedication. She has led the City Council, City staff, board and 
commission members, and most importantly, the New Hope community 
through unprecedented challenges and reshaped the city. There is no 
question that New Hope will benefit from her thoughtful stewardship for 
generatIons to come.

                      Wednesday, November 20, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Specialist Joshua Smith, a distinguished veteran of the Michigan Army 
National Guard. Raised in Caro, Michigan, he graduated from Caro High 
School. Josh demonstrated his commitment to service by joining the Army 
National Guard in 2018. He underwent rigorous training, completing 
Basic Training at Fort Benning and Advanced Individual Training at Fort 
Leonard Wood, specializing as an 88M Motor Transport Operator. He was 
assigned to the 237th Brigade Support Battalion in Bay City.
  Josh deployed to Syria from 2022 to 2023, where he served with honor 
and distinction. During his deployment, his duties included operating a 
10k SkyTrak, loading C-130 aircraft, and recovering essential equipment 
and supplies from airdrops. His efforts were vital to the logistical 
support of his unit and other forces stationed in the region. In the 
challenging environment of an active combat zone, Josh excelled as a 
member of the fuel crew, ensuring that every generator on the base was 
fully fueled through dedicated shifts. His contributions were crucial 
to maintaining operational readiness and supporting his fellow service 
members.
  Notably, Josh was present during a rocket attack on March 23, 2023, 
when 15 122mm rockets were fired from Iraq at Rumalyn Landing Zone in 
Syria. Thanks to his leadership and quick response, there were no 
injuries or damage to equipment during this hostile incident. Josh&#x27;s 
actions during this time earned him the Combat Action Badge, a 
testament to his bravery and professionalism.
  Additionally, Josh had the unique opportunity to train with special 
forces during his premobilization at Fort Bliss, further enhancing his 
skills and readiness.
  Specialist Josh Smith exemplifies the dedication, resilience, and 
selflessness that we honor in our armed forces. I commend him for his 
service and commitment to our Nation.

                      Wednesday, November 20, 2024

  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Mayor Dale Archer of 
East Greenwich Township, who has dedicated many years of service to our 
community, including 11 years as mayor. Under his leadership, East 
Greenwich has flourished with strong fiscal management and innovative 
solutions for local governance. He improved the township&#x27;s finances by 
implementing a five-year plan with policies that allowed him to manage 
the community effectively, resulting in the second-lowest tax rate in 
Gloucester County. Because of his guidance, East Greenwich received the 
Innovative Government Award from the League of Municipalities for its 
shared fire department service with Paulsboro. The remarkable progress 
East Greenwich has made since Mayor Archer took office led to the town 
being recognized as the Best Small Town in New Jersey by South Jersey 
Magazine. In addition to his commitment to his community, Mayor Archer 
served the world&#x27;s finest fighting force, the United States Marine 
Corps, and has been a long-time member of both the Veteran of Foreign 
Wars and the Marine Corps League. I thank Mayor Dale Archer, for his 
dedicated service to East Greenwich and our country, and I look forward 
to seeing all that he will accomplish in the future. God bless Mayor

                      Wednesday, November 20, 2024

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. I rise today to recognize Melinda Franca Fleming, a 
pillar of the Sonora community.
  Melinda was born on the Hoopa Indian Reservation in Northern 
California and grew up in a small town called Waterford. In her early 
adult life, she worked to balance part-time jobs and family obligations 
with her college work, earning an associate degree from Columbia 
College and later graduating Summa Cum Laude from Stanislaus State. 
Melinda pursued a substitute teaching job prior to earning her teaching 
credential from the University of the Pacific.
  As a full-time teacher, Melinda became quickly involved in her school 
community where she taught English, reading, journalism,

[[Page E1178]]

speech, yearbook, and newspaper. She was such a positive force that she 
was twice recognized as teacher of the year.
  Melinda would later leave teaching to spend more time with her 
family, which now includes her husband Ken and their three children, 
nine grandchildren, and great-grandchild.
  Melinda soon continued her community service as Executive Director of 
the Tuolumne County Alliance for Resources and Environment (TuCARE), a 
non-profit promoting good stewardship of public lands. By hosting 
educational lands tours with regional leaders and annual conferences on 
forest health, Melinda has had an incalculable impact not only on local 
forestry, but on informing long-term policies needed to save our 
forests, communities, and local economies for posterity. Due to her 
twenty years of service, TuCARE has been recognized as a non-profit of 
the year, a testament to her influence and dedication.
  Mr. Speaker, Melinda Fleming spent her life serving her community. 
Whether educating and mentoring our youth or advising senior 
policymakers, Melinda&#x27;s passion to better those around her embodies her 
true character as a model citizen. We are better for her service, and 
we know that even in retirement she will continue to serve through the 
shining example that is her legacy.

nominated for the CIF State Model Coach Award, which recognizes coaches 
who demonstrate a longstanding commitment to fostering students&#x27; 
potential. One of his greatest accomplishments is the success of his 
sons, Austin and Daven, both of whom attended Tulare Western and played 
key roles in the water polo team&#x27;s championship victory during their 
time as students. It is because of the commitment of educators like Mr. 
Hodge that students in the Central Valley community thrive, and I want 
to thank Mr. Hodge for creating an environment that helps our youth 
become the best they can be. His dedication to the students at Tulare 
Western High School is a true testament to his character, and I am 
confident that his leadership will have a lasting impact on the Tulare 
Western community for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Mr. David Hodge 
for his decades of service to the Central Valley and wishing him a 
happy and well-deserved retirement.

  RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF GOOD SHEPHERD HOUSING &amp; FAMILY 
                             SERVICES, INC.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

                              of virginia

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 20, 2024

  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate 
Good Shepherd Housing (GSH) on their 50th anniversary of dedicated 
service to Fairfax County, Virginia, and to the thousands of 
individuals and families whose lives have been transformed by their 
efforts.
  For half a century, Good Shepherd has been a cornerstone in our 
community, providing safe, stable housing and vital support services to 
those at risk of homelessness or struggling to remain in their homes 
due to rising housing costs. Their work has unlocked doors to brighter 
futures for countless individuals and families, and they remain a 
beacon of hope for those facing housing insecurity.
  Good Shepherd is more than just a provider of affordable housing--it 
is a catalyst for self-sufficiency and community resilience. Through a 
unique approach that focuses on the purchase and transformation of 
properties into affordable housing, GSH has not only provided shelter 
but has built a foundation for personal growth and long-term success. 
By offering a comprehensive suite of support services--including case 
management, financial education, and referrals to specialized 
assistance--GSH helps families and individuals chart a path to 
stability, independence, and empowerment.

[[Page E1179]]

  Each year, GSH manages the needs of over 1,000 families and 
individuals, helping them overcome obstacles and build a better future. 
With a small but dedicated team--just 9 full-time staff, 3 part-time 
staff, and over 40 volunteers--Good Shepherd Housing has managed to 
accomplish extraordinary things. The work they do, however, is made 
possible not only by their staff but by the unwavering commitment of 
their board members, volunteers, and the community that supports them.
  As we celebrate Good Shepherd Housing&#x27;s remarkable 50-year legacy, I 
would like to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who has played a 
part in this incredible work--past and present board members, staff, 
volunteers, and all the partners who have worked hand-in-hand with GSH 
to strengthen our community. I would also like to recognize the 
outstanding leadership of Executive Director Genee Hayes and Deputy 
Executive Director Candice Bennett. Their dedication and vision have 
been integral to the organization&#x27;s growth and success, earning well 
deserved recognition from the Washington Post, Leadership Fairfax, and 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Their collective 
impact serves as a reminder that when we invest in affordable housing 
and support services, we unlock the potential for families to thrive, 
not just survive.
  Good Shepherd Housing is a true example of how innovative approaches 
and community partnerships can make a tangible difference in the lives 
of those who need it most. The organization&#x27;s case management team 
works individually with residents to set personal goals, pursue 
education, and improve financial literacy, helping to break the cycle 
of poverty and create lasting change.
  As we look to the future, I have no doubt that Good Shepherd Housing 
will continue to be a leader in providing affordable housing solutions 
and support services in our community. Their work is a testament to the 
power of compassion, collaboration, and commitment to social justice.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Good 
Shepherd Housing on their 50th anniversary and in expressing our thanks 
for their tireless dedication to Fairfax County, Virginia.

        RECOGNIZING THE LEONARD &amp; SARAH BELL FARM IN UNIONVILLE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LISA C. McCLAIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, November 20, 2024

  Mrs. McCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Leonard and 
Sarah Bell Farm in Unionville, Michigan, which has been named the Farm 
of the Year by the Michigan Centennial Farm Association for 2024. This 
prestigious recognition honors farms that exemplify exceptional 
qualities in five key areas: longevity, stewardship, historic 
preservation, community involvement, and organizational membership and 
promotional activity.
  The Bell family&#x27;s 76-acre farm, now owned and operated by David and 
Phyllis Bell, is an enduring testament to Michigan&#x27;s agricultural 
heritage. The farm&#x27;s origins trace back to 1919, when Leonard and Sarah 
Bell established the farm as part of their contribution to the 
agricultural development of Tuscola County. Leonard, a descendant of 
some of the county&#x27;s earliest families, cultivated a variety of crops, 
including wheat, corn, navy beans, oats, and hay, supporting both his 
livestock and the local economy.
  In the decades since its founding, the farm has remained in the Bell 
family for six generations, with David and Phyllis continuing the proud 
legacy of sustainable farming. Under their stewardship, the farm grows 
a diverse range of crops--sugar beets, corn, navy beans, soybeans, and 
wheat--carefully rotated each year to maintain soil health and 
productivity.
  The Bell farm has also earned several prestigious environmental and 
historical designations, including a federal Certificate of Farm War 
Service during World War II, a National Wildlife Federation Certified 
Wildlife Habitat, a Monarch Waystation, and a Certified Butterfly 
Garden. These efforts not only preserve Michigan&#x27;s natural beauty but 
also demonstrate the Bell family&#x27;s deep commitment to environmental 
stewardship and biodiversity.
  Beyond their agricultural achievements, the Bell family has been 
active in their local community, participating in farm organizations 
and sharing their story to promote the importance of preserving 
Michigan&#x27;s farming history. Their farm is a living example of the 
values that the Michigan Centennial Farm Association seeks to honor 
each year.

[[Page E1180]]

  It is also worth noting that the next generation of Bells, including 
great-grandchildren, continue to take part in the farm&#x27;s daily 
operations. Whether helping with the animals, or assisting with 
planting and harvesting, their involvement in the farm ensures that 
this important piece of Michigan history will continue to thrive for 
many years to come.
  On behalf of my colleagues, I extend heartfelt congratulations to 
David and Phyllis Bell and their family for being named the Farm of the 
Year by the Michigan Centennial Farm Association. Their dedication to 
preserving Michigan&#x27;s agricultural heritage and fostering a sense of 
community through farming serves as an inspiration to us all.
